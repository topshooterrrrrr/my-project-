0,"I got 'new' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \nI took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire \""this time\"". \nI will never go back to Flynn's b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!"
0,"Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing."
0,"All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\n\nOur food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\n\nWe asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?\n\nOver all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so."
0,"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around."
0,Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.
2,"This is a tiny Starbucks and it locations like this (although cute) makes you wonder if your really meant to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave. Leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with benches and it is a central part of the Waterfront Shopping. \n\nStarbuck isn't my favorite coffee chain by any means. Is it just me or do all Starbuck coffees taste a little burnt and bitter? No matter how trendy, cool and upscale their establishments are I can't get around the yicky tasting bitterness of Staryucks regular coffees. Talk about over roasting a bean...Maybe something has changed with their regular coffee but I have not drank it in about a year. I am not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff. Still I'll give the establishment tres estrellas for the fact that their espresso is acceptable and doesn't taste half as bad as the regular coffee bean."
1,"Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks: \n\n1. Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty, compared to the other Starbucks I have been in.\n\n2. If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.\n\nAside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service."
3,"So.Much.Fun! \n\nI WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. \n\nThis is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. \n\nKeep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! \n\nThe guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. \n\nMy favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). \n\nThe birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!"
3,"My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \n\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \""Rubber Ducky\"" and \""Gangsta's Paradise\"" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \""anything else,\"" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \""yinz\"" instead of \""you.\""\n\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. \""I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\"" he said when she requested him.\n\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\n\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\n\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbr\u00e4uhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list."
2,Stopped by on a Mon evening after trying to dine at Smoke Taqueria which is closed Mondays. Parking on street in front or behind off Hay St. Super friendly bartender. In warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. Okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. Tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. Also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! Home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. Bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. Bet it's a fun place in warmer months.
1,"Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.\n\nMy mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.  \n\nI like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead."
3,"We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion."
0,"To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. \n\nWhat an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead."
1,"Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \""kind of like Coors Light\"".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  \n\nThe food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though."
3,"This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really, I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here."
3,"Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back."
2,"Great Barnes and Noble location, and they have plenty of books that'll help you pass the time."
0,"The words \""epic fail\"" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.\n\nWe went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\n\nThe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\n\nBy 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.\n\nInstead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.\n\nBar Louie:  You are dead to me."
0,"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\n\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \n\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service."
2,"This place was pretty good food, but the service however was just horrible. As a friend said they hire for looks, not work ethic. Plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous. Our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us. The couple behind us came in the same time and wasn't even attended too until after OUR appetizers were being cleared off. \n\nThe food was pretty good, but because of the service I won't be returning."
1,"The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special! You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass. I signed up last year for this promotion and don't think I got the passes worth. \n\nThe waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though.\n\n1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. \n\nNext remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I'm not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. \n\nIf you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won't use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \""I'm an adult and you need to have some respect.\"" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!\n\nSandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don't even care that I'm getting splashed all the time I do realize that I'm at a pool but it's hard to relax.\n\nIf you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you're trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer."
2,"This place is kind of a hybrid of Applebee's and CPK, which isn't to say it's bad, but nothing to rave about either. I got their slider meal, which was tiny (for me) and my friend got their steak (which was way tiny). The food was fine and the service was okay, but really felt like an Applebee's knockoff (and Applebee's isn't even worth knocking-offing anyway). \n\n3 stars"
1,"I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \""chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\""  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \""drizzling\"" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \""numero uno\"" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling."
2,"I think the location in homestead has ruined this place. Dirty dirty dirty.\n\nBathrooms unkept, entry door handle and windows filthy\n\nPizza had too much sauce on it and was drenched. Server was coarse, not refined\n\nServing items were old and rusty. Temperature of food was not hot\n\nLow quality, but probably ok with pittsburgher s"
2,"Last week was my first visit to this place. The raspberry tea was amazing. We got the app sampler,  it was very good except for the homemade guacamole. I ordered a side salad, hardly any dressing on it, and not very fresh. I ordered the stuffed chicken with broccoli & grilled vegetables.  Waited along time for the entr\u00e9e.  The chicken was good but a small portion.  The broccoli & veggies were water logged. Lots of water on the plate. Tried my friends fried shrimp, it was good with good flavor. Might have just been who was in the kitchen that night so I would give it another shot."
0,"I hate this place.\nIt's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.\nIf you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service."
1,"REDO!\n\nI went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \n\nMy issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  \n\nMy resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.\n\nSo we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better."
3,"First, this is a big chain - not my favorite type of eatery.  For me, four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique...\n\nHowever!  The Chilean Sea Bass Marinated in Oolong Tea is freakin' fantastic!  10+\n\nNow - everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night, servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good.\n\nI've been to PFC Vegas and PFC NYC - our Homestead PFC definitely beats them both.  So many great little places to try in the 'Burgh, but I wouldn't resist going back to this particular PFC."
4,"This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon."
1,"I went here on a recent business trip, and there aren't many decent options in West Homestead, so I decided to splurge on the company's dollar and  ordered take-out.   \n\nI was highly disappointed in the service, and I only ordered take out.    Upon going to the bar to announce that I was there for take out, there were 3 other people at the bar.   The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.    \n\nAfter announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  No offer of water, or a drink.  Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    He placed a glass of water in front of me.\n\nThen I hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  .\""it's TAKEOUT\""  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.\n\nGentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)\n\nAfter more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  She then rings me up.   I don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.\n\nWhen i go to eat my meal, utensils were not included.  I now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with. \n\nVERY DISAPPOINTING experience.   Will not be returning."
3,Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close.
3,Good. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Went yesterday with family and enjoyed oysters(very fresh). I always like appetizers more than their entrees
0,"You know it's bad when a McDonald's gets a 1 star review...I mean, seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a McDonald's. The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!\n\nForget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\n\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it."
4,This place is amazing!!! Jim is a great artist!!! Traveled all the way from Tampa just to get my tattoo!!! I would recommend this place to everyone!!!
0,"BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our \""go-to\"" restaurant.\n\nAFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.\n\nThe food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe."
0,"Terrible! I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. \n\nI then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. \n\nThe \""stylist\"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said \""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line\"" and the lady said \""oh we don't do that.\"" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. \n\nAnd waited, and waited, while one \""stylist\"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been \""on break,\"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said \""after I'm done here,\"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving. Will never go back."
4,This cafe's espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere.  I always go out of my way to get coffee from here when I'm in Pittsburgh.
3,"I love Tazza D'oro! It is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.\n\nIt it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.\n\nI usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.\n\nI'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip."
0,"The coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care. If you're a local, I get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for. \n\nI really wanted to like tazza d'oro. I've been several times, hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. I drink espresso. I know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. I have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and I let you know you should probably try again. \n\nThe last time I went in, both baristas admitted they hadn't tried/pulled the espresso I ordered. The gentlemen working there, who was very nice, pulled my shot. I tried it and it was very sour. I let the girl standing directly in front of me know that I didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment \""ya well we just got it\"". Silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you \""just got\"" to taste good...\n\nThis place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. It's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. It's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off."
1,"Superbowl Sunday at the Blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the \"" who really cares about this game\""  show. I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. \n\nThe food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was \""EH\"". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside. Madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here I most likely won't be back."
1,"Pass on this place, there are better restaurants mere feet away.\n\nThe menu here is too large, which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good.  And, its not good.  Some of the salads are alright, but its just not good food.\n\nThe service is friendly and prompt, but the beer is over priced.  They do have a good selection though.\n\nThis place is open late if you need a bite to eat, but there are so much better options out there."
1,Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar.
3,The decor is nothing fancy but the food is surprisingly good (and fresh). I've gotten takeout and eaten at the buffet. Both good for the price - it's inexpensive.
1,"The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \""krab\"", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup."
4,"The first time I came here, I waited in line for 20 minutes.  When it was my turn, I realized I left my wallet in the car.  It hurt so bad, I didn't come back for a year.\n\nI can walk to this place from my house- which is dangerous because those biscuits are just OH SO DREAMY.  I can't describe them.  Just get some.\n\nDo I feel guilty about noshing on fabulous Strawberry Napoleons and Jewish Pizza (kind of like a modified, yet TOTALLY delicious fruitcake bar) at 10:15am?  Hecks, naw... But they do have quiche and some other breakfast-y items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomach's opening ceremony.\n\nJust go early :)  They open at 10 on Saturdays.  And bring cash...it's easier that way."
0,"I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\n\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \""personal\"" pie, costs $7 and is 7\"" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \""small,\"" which is 10\"". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\"" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\"" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\"" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\""\n\nI ate three out of the six \""slices.\"" (One sixth of a 10\"" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.\n\nI know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh."
2,"So I went back to Casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. The granola I had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch! But it's not worth the money for dinner. Mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food..."
1,"Had a very lack-luster Mother's Day brunch at Casbah yesterday. Despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m., we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. I asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. An utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but I think Casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile."
3,"So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!)."
1,"For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \""yes, it's got lemon in it.\"" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\"" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there."
3,"This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah."
2,"To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two."
2,"Stopped here for drinks before we went on to dinner elsewhere. In hindsight, we wish we had stayed here. :-)\n\nWe had a couple of great beers and just enjoyed the excellent music soundtrack before we moved on to our next designation. I hope to come back here sometime in the future and actually have...a meal. I like this funkier part of town."
0,"Maybe I am just the most jaded vegan in town; Quiet Storm's food menu bores me to tears, that which I will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home! Their coffee isn't all that great either, as given the choice, local La Prima is in my favor. Tears. This is the only vegetarian restaurant on the East side of town, and oh so close to me, but I cannot stand to go there. Desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room."
3,"I've only been here for Sunday brunch, but I look forward to dining here again in the hopefully near future.  The frittata was thicker than any I've seen elsewhere (it looked like a square of lasagna) but very tasty.  I liked the inclusion of sliced potatoes.\n\nThe Low Country grits were creamy and also enjoyable, but not too flavorful.  I didn't really taste the fakin' bacon or the garlic supposedly in the dish.  I'm not surprised though,  since a lot of vegetarian places seem to go light on the seasoning.  Definitely ask for cheddar with your grits if you eat dairy.  The three kinds of hot sauce on the table also help perk things up.\n\nNo complaints about the service, but they use some sort of chemical cleaner (for the floors or to wipe down the tables, maybe?) that's unpleasant-smelling.  I noticed it less the longer we stayed, maybe because I got food in front of me, but one would hope that a vegetarian establishment might opt for more environmentally friendly and less noxious cleaners.  Other diners were also commenting on the smell when we were there.  I'm guessing this isn't a regular smell to the place, though, since no other reviewers have commented on it.  \n\nThe cash-only policy is also a bit of a nuisance, since I'd consider the prices ($11 for brunch entrees) here to be mid-range and not ultra-cheap.  Still, I will come again with my greenbacks."
3,"right by my house, spicy peanut and cheesy snake are amazing."
1,"I'm going to revise my review of Quiet Storm.\n\nYou may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. In my experience, however (considering the 30+ Cubanos I've eaten there), you're more likely to get a sad, mediocre rendition.\n\nConsistency is not their strong point.\n\nAdd to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude, and I've decided to steer clear.\n\nIt's a shame that I no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at Quiet Storm. It's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful, friendly, and helpful, and yet their efforts are overshadowed.\n\nSorry, Quiet Storm. As a Pittsburgh vegetarian, I want to love you. But you broke my heart."
1,"I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? \n\nWell, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \""firesticks\"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead."
3,Love this place! The decor inside is really cool.\n\nI'm not from the area but I try to stop in every time I'm traveling through. So many great veg options and great drinks.
0,"It's cheap, I'll say that, but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. There are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from."
4,"Our favorite place to go for chocolate peanut butter soy milkshakes. We've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything we've gotten has been incredibly delicious. Love this place!"
1,"Ew. Okay, not the worst pizza ever, but it's pretty far down my list of pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across the street from it. This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, \""Excitingly flavored!\"" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them. Two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when I moved into my apartment and hadn't unpacked my kitchen stuff yet. Without them I may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta.\n\nOh, and here's a little Italian lesson for you: it's \""perfetta,\"" not \""perfectta.\"""
0,"Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here."
3,"I'm definitely a fan of East End Food Co-op.  Their produce is always very fresh and of really high quality-it keeps really well once you get it home too, and while prices are slightly higher than an average grocery store, it's definitely worth it.  My favorite part of the Co-op is the bulk section-- it's a great way to buy items in the exact quanities you need rather than ending up with way more than you want!  The same goes for the spices--such a bargain!  The Juice bar has great smoothies and juices--they're a little pricier than I'm used to, but great for a bit of a splurge!"
2,"The products and service are great, but the prices are outrageous!\n\nI am on a vegan diet and have found this co-op really helpful. If you can get past the prices, the selection is great!"
4,"East End Food Co-op is awesome!\n\nIf I had to choose between the Co-op and WF, the Co-op is where it's at.\n\nThere is a good selection of fruits and veggies, as well as toiletries (shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, tampons, shaving creams, etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse with a good selection of frozen meals, ice cream (dairy and nondairy), and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans, or for people with severe allergies like myself. \n\nThey also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy to find that they had my favorite Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can, it's not like one of those energy shots at all). \n\nThe deli is also fantastic, and I highly recommend the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options. \n\nIf you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. \n\nThere is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store."
0,Worst climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump..
3,"For 30 bucks a month, this is a pretty rad spot. I've climbed all over the US and Canada, but I'm happy to call this my home gym."
1,"Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote."
1,"The art museum is pretty nice; the carriage and car museum is cool; and it's neat to walk through the greenhouse.  Those are free.  However, nothing really separates the $12 house tour from other house tours.  Like the other ones, the docents don't focus on anything interesting, like history or the architecture or the building itself.  They focus on some family story that may only be of passing interest because the family is rich.  Kind of like hearing about Paris Hilton or the Kardashians.  B-o-r-i-n-g. And what kind of tourist attraction doesn't allow pictures?"
3,"I've been going to Izzazu for a very long time, almost 7 years now. I have ALWAYS gone to Cesare and will never stray from him! The first time I went into him, I was 18 years old and had some crazy red, blond and black hair. He really helped me go back to my natural color without damaging my hair (even with color stripping!) \n\nHe always knows exactly what I want, but isn't afraid to give me suggestions to liven up my look. He literally does the best color and cut in the city. And believe me, I've done some crazy stuff with my hair with a lot of hair dressers. \n\nThe atmosphere is very hip/chic and makes me feel like a celebrity when I go there!\n\nAlso, I LOVE their product line. I still only use Izzazu leave-in conditioner, hairspray and dry shampoo, even while spending over half of my year away from Pittsburgh at school.\n\nThe loss of one star goes to the attitude at reception. I understand it has compelled people to give them 1 star, but it IS a salon, meant for cosmetic services. You aren't going there for the reception. But, It wouldn't hurt them to smile or be a little less brash."
1,"Maybe I went on a bad night, but the service was stunningly bad.  Water glasses stayed empty for almost 15 minutes!  Ordered 5 dishes, all pretty average.  The tab:  $300+.  I won't be back."
4,"Incredible experience up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally love this style of Italian cooking. Sicilian, so folks who are not familiar should take look at their menu online before coming because it might catch you off guard, it isn't what the \""normal\"" Italian restaurant offers. \n\nI had a great experience dodging potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking.\n\nUpon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The \""Holy Oil\"" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. \n\nThen be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.\n\nI then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.\n\nI did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.\n\nI wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!"
3,The Park House is a great place to drink. They have a very good beer selection and even though the kitchen is a 4 foot by 4 foot square behind the bar the food is really good. \n\nThey have all you can eat Popcorn and Peanuts so you will never be in want of something to snack on while drinking your favorite beer. \n\nThey have live bands several times a week my favorite being Tuesdays which often features local Blue Grass musicians.  \n\nThe down side to this place for me is that it's a little on the expensive side. They have a majority of their beers that are 6+ bucks a pint which a bit much. You can get some for $4.50 - $5  but it cuts your selection significantly. It definitely makes you think twice before going here often. I just wish all their beers were under $5 because I would probably try and go here more often.  \n\nOver all it's a great bar the owner is a nice guy and you're going to have a great time.
4,"I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's."
4,"I had a week off from work recently.  I needed it to take a little break and I decided, what better way to get caught up on all the museums and cultural institutions in the 'Burgh?\n\nTo say that the Carnegie is THE Pittsburgh Cultural Institution is indeed an understatement and as I live in nearby Squirrel Hill, I am so happy to have it within walking distance.  Although the day I visited, I rode my bike and parked it all day.  (Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).\n\nI decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, \""stuffed and mounted\"" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.\n\nA long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\n\nBut as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  \n\nOne special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is \""Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs\"".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.  \n\nSo while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art.  To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.  I did and I still feel like I didn't see everything."
0,"At this point, I am done. I scheduled my kids for the last 2 weeks in August and then due to an emergency, I had to cancel, which I did a month before their camp was to start. I was told they were issuing my refund, and that was 3 weeks ago. THREE WEEKS and i still dont have it. I live probably 30 minutes from the museum and could have driven there 63838484848485858 times by now and picked it up. Its just sooo unprofessional and annoying. They need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner. 7-10 business days are fine but 3 WEEKS is UNACCEPTABLE for it to not have even been MAILED YET. So dissapointed and will never use them again."
4,OK so another winner in this neighborhood besides Nicky's.  The Penna Parma was outstanding and the Parm crusted salmon over whole wheat artichoke ravioli with a white basil sauce on special tonight was a great combo and wonderfully executed.  Katie our server was professional AND personable and only added to our outstanding meal.....then there were the Pittsbugh natives seated nearby who were friendly and delightful to visit with.   WOW what a place.  The only downside is that its a little tight inside and a little loud but don't let that stop you!  Well worth the trip!
1,"Its okay, but it was just ok.  \n\nThere's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard.  We were expecting that would be for the table.\n\nWe started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.\n\nThey give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.\n\nMy friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.\n\nOverall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana."
4,"Those who know, know this is the place to buy your cases of beer. The prices are low and the tax is included in the price tag, but the best reason to shop here is Sam. He is a character, knows a lot about beer and is a really nice guy.  First time we stopped by, he invited us into his shop and stock area and we talked for quite a while before departing with some real good beer.  Sam Caruso has a story for almost every occasion and  the beer to match each occasion. A real Pittsburgh place."
0,"This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated \""made in the 70s\"" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's."
1,"The only reason to shop here is that going anywhere else is out of your way. The prices our worse than other GE stores and I wonder why. The produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good . The store never looks very clean. I was hopeful a couple of years ago when the store was refurbished and it was nicer for a while but now it's back to it's old ways. I have friends that refuse to go there because of the scary parking lot where people sell \""things\"" out of their cars and at the driveway exit. If there is outside cameras, the Pgh police should take a look. I wish there was an alternative to shop in the northside. Kuhns off Brighton rd is about the same except the prices are better."
1,"This is a small, franchise-owned location that caters to the predominantly low income households in the area. Selection is quite limited throughout the store with limited quantities on the shelf of the items they do carry. Because of the area in which it is located, the store is NOT 24-hours as most Giant Eagle's seem to be. \n\nThe pharmacy inside the store, unlike the store itself, is corporate owned, and it's staff is friendly and efficient. A stark contrast to the rest of the store.\n\nOnce again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves, there will be one of more jitney's (unlicensed cabs, effectively) waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee. \n\nIn general, if you CAN shop somewhere else, you will probably want to."
3,"This place is great! The wait, pushy counter person, and unattended children are an easy overlook when I finally leave with the best fill and nail art I've ever had! Lisa was super quick, had me drying in less than 15 minutes of sitting down in her chair! I found the nail art I wanted (she copied it perfectly, by the way) on pintrest, but just as I sat down, my phone died. She pulled out her charger, AND CHARGED MY PHONE. Where else has anyone done this? Nowhere. Lisa actually made conversation, and she was easy to understand. I will be back in two weeks for another fill! \n\nJust a heads up, go early, if you can, as it gets closer to close, more and more people line up. :) it's so worth the wait, though!!"
1,"I have a dream. A dream that some day the North Shore will have a ton of amazing food options. I hope one day it will become a reality. For now, I think there's a smattering of okay-ish places and a lot of mediocrity. \n\nMaybe it's just the built in crowd. You come to a game, you gotta eat, right? And what are you going to eat? Either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside. At this point I'd stick with inside for the novelty of it all. \n\nI stopped into Atria's on game day, but came in right as the first pitch was going out, so it wasn't packed in the least. Our server was obviously not into us, as well as serving that day, as she was pretty short with us the entire time. Sorry we bothered you...\n\nThe menu is incredibly limited with around 5 apps, 5 sandwiches and 5 main courses. I get that they're probably just limiting things for the crowded times, but I felt like nothing really called to me. I settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until I was inside the stadium to get my \""main course.\"" Crab fries, naturally. But that's beside the point.\n\nThe pieorgies we ordered were okay. They were doused in Parmesan cheese and a little overcooked, but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had. Wasn't the best either. I think what really turned me off was the whole experience. Service, small selection and mediocre food. I should have just ordered two buckets of crab fries and called it a night!"
0,"When you walk into a buzzing restaurant, you'd expect to be greeted by someone, be that a server, a greeter or the bartender. I went in last night, stood around for almost 10 minutes, and was completely ignored. I was meeting a few friends, so I decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later.  Reservation confirmed, and beer finished, I walk back over, walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone. He finishes, we make eye contact, he nods and walks away. My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the \""CEO doesn't like us to do that\"". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed. The fake sincerity is what really got me. You know what a 'private party' sign does? It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements."
2,"A brick wood-fired smoker with a cast iron door, a stainless steel prep table with cutting boards, cooler case, a cash register, and a man who has been tending the coals well beyond your time.\n\nWilson's is what a great BBQ place should be.  Simple. \n\nThere is no sense in overanalyzing what Mr. Wilson has been doing here for years.  He's not a competition circuit smoker, not a modern restaurateur spreading his seed across Pittsburgh, and certainly no hipster chef serving ingredients grown in his rooftop garden.\n\nRibs. Chicken. Sauce.\n\nThe slow smoked spare ribs, sold by the plate size or full rack, are smoked just long enough to make the rib bones protrude from the top of the slab but not long enough so the meat is \""falling off the bone\""... tender and juicy, but enough bite to let you know that you're eating the flesh off an animal.  The color and texture of the surface aren't overwhelming in flavor but give you just enough crust and seasoning to let you experience the strata of bark / meat / fat.  For those that don't like fat, you'll complain about the ribs.  Spares have a tendency to hold a bit more fat within the meat fibers, particularly the section around the tips that are usually trimmed for a St. Louis cut.  you want low fat? Eat a pork loin or a handful of grass.\n\nThe chickens are halved and smoked right alongside the ribs. The skin had nice chew, a good simple rub, and cooked beyond the point of any gummy texture but not so long that it was a layer of armor surrounding the meat.  The dark meat was succulent and the white meat maintained just the right amount of moisture.\n\nAs requested, everything was served with the hot BBQ sauce.  Not mind blowingly hot, but a well rounded picquant flavor with a bit of black pepper on the tip of the tongue.  Tomato base with a bit of vinegar, good enough to compliment the meat and fat of both animals.\n\nAs for sides, the collard greens are tender and you'll come across the occasional gold nugget of pork.  The coleslaw and macaroni salad are simple and a bit underseasoned, but when eaten in tandem with the meat and sauce they compliment everything just fine.  Mr. Wilson also caps off an order with the true stamp of great bbq... white bread. A vessel to mop up all the rib shrapnel swimming in the pool of sauce at the bottom of your styrofoam container.\n\nIt's not the cleanest, it's not the classiest... why?  It's a rib shack in an old house that's been here for going on 53 years.  It may not be the best barbecue you'll ever eat, but in a city with new restaurants popping up every week that all try to outduel each other with trendy ingredients, it's nice to know that I can walk in through an old screen door and be slapped in the face with a stiff breeze of smoking pork... without having to worry about anyone selling me small portion size, extravagant presentation, and a list of 35 ingredients to compose a single dish."

He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best!"

1,"After seeing a Google Offer for Miller's, my Mom mentioned how she had been there before and remembered good food and fond memories from her childhood.  So I offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good.  \n\nOnce we were seated and greeted by our waitress, we presented the paperwork for our Google Offer.  The waitress handed it to the hostess.  I guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it's legit.  Well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it.  In the end she talked to someone and figured it out, but she made it seem like we did something wrong.  Or, she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do.  Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.  I later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - I guess they have several patrons who use those regularly.  Apparently with this kind of reception, no one wants to pay full price.\n\nMom and I both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty.  I ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork, not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich.  We left with full and happy tummies.\n\nTo comment on previous reviews....yes, this is not the cleanest place.  But I expected that and find it part of the charm.  The smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room.\n\nOverall, it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich.  I'd like to give it 3 stars at least, but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away."
3,People and company make mistakes. \nThe owner personally took responsibility for the mistake and fixed the problem. \n\nThis shows they care about their customers and value the business!!
2,Tasty
1,"you can't beat a fairly centrally-located grocery store that is open 24-7 BUTTT the smell in there is ughhh.  Years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc.    You get the picture .    The high-point is perhaps the hot foods that you can get over in the deli.-area.  Some really good \""soul-food\"" .  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and etc... I will go out of my way for that stuff, sometimes ..."
1,"Another ugly haircut like everywhere in Pittsburgh. For $60 with the owner. Trusted the reviews, but now look like a Pittsburgh redneck. No hair on the sides and long on the back!"
3,Had lunch with my wife. The quality of the sushi was quite good. My wife had some tempura that was fabulous. Service was friendly and quick. We really enjoyed our lunch. We will be back.
0,"Below par diner food. Fried zucchini is all breading and no zucchini. Anything fried always comes dripping in grease, I know, I know it's diner food but it doesn't have to be so greasy it makes you physically ill. I'm a big fan of blt's and there's is pretty poor. Small portion with very little meat and dry bread.\n\nBesides the food, the service is so so. Last time I was in I asked for a lemonade and the waitress forgot it, asked for mayo and there was none on my sandwich, and this was on a slow day\n\nWith eat n park down the street and Pamela's not too far away it seems you have much better places to get you're grub on. I'm giving it one star because I can't see myself ever coming back or recommending the place to anyone else."
4,Excellent and made from scratch !!!!
0,This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here.
3,"Darren it cracked me up to see you reviewed this Eat'n Park, but then I wasn't surprised a bit. I used to live blocks away from this place, and the location was ideal, for my favorite bar ever (Wilkie's Inn, now closed) was diagonally across the street from it. I actually have mostly bad memories of drunken friends fighting and/or confrontations here, but still this place beats all after a night at the bar. I can close my eyes and picture scrambled eggs and french toast, not to mention their delicious burgers with a side of pickles. And of course the obligatory Eat'n Park smiley face cookies, ah how I love them! Message to non-Pittsburghers, go to this (or any) Eat'n Park at least once! You'll be back!"
3,"We go here quite often for lunch. The food is excellent. Service is friendly, but spotty. If your in a hurry for lunch, I would advise you call ahead. I think perhaps the time it takes is because food is made to order. A great thing for the quality and taste but not so much if you have a limited amount of time. The lunch specials are a fantastic deal, and no matter what else I get , I get the spinach salad. It's scrumptious. Definitely recommend this place. Dinner I have had a couple times and the food was good, but the lunch deals are awesome!"
1,"Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype."
1,"The Hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment.  We moved in to the neighborhood, and all we heard was Campiti's this Campiti's that, and how it is without a doubt, the best pizza in the Burgh.\n\nSo, of course we tried it, and were pretty excited to do so. Now I have lived in several different Pittsburgh neighborhoods, and you always find the pizza you like where you live. Campiti's pizza is not the pizza I like. I wouldn't order a pizza from them again.\n\nHonestly, it was about up to a frozen pizza standard. Now, I'm not saying they are making frozen pizzas, they aren't but, I have even had better frozen pizzas than the pizza we got from Campiti's.\n\nAnother reviewer hit the nail on the head saying people who say this is the best pizza around probably have some long running emotional attachment to this place That can be he only logical reason that people actually say it.\n\n."
0,Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!
0,"Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales."
2,"The pizza is great. Other food items might disappoint. They do deliver! Service is hit and miss. There is one rude,  smile-less bartender... I have actually seen him through the window and decided to go somewhere else because I was in the mood for good service."
1,"I guess that I sport a very simple haircut and like to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the person who cut my hair here must have slipped with the razor just behind my ear and tried to make it look normal by cleaning it up and making the other side look the same. Since I don't typically look at myself for extended periods of time, I actually didn't notice until last night when I was washing my hands in a resteraunt bathroom.  I will be speaking with manager come Monday. \n\nI had no wait and the lady who can't cut my simple hair do was very nice, until she didn't say oops I sort of f*'d your hair up. It isn't really bad and I'm not horribly upset but it IS noticeable! It would have been nice if she said something to me about it. I think this warrants a refund of my money. I will let you all know if I got my money back."
4,"Lovely floral arrangements for every occasion.  Her boutonnieres and corsages are lovely and inexpensive - she must have made dozens for me and my friends during high school.  You cannot beat the service here.  When students at the elementary school up the street come in wanting flowers for their teachers, she will provide them with the best for only $1 or $2.  Blooming Dahlia is the best example of hometown service I could imagine."
1,"The service is not that amazing, it's almost as if they don't care to have a business. I've dealt with them for large orders and while meeting the deadlines they request, it's never enough. They usually don't have your requested kegs and will tell you to order earlier (which by experience still does not help). \n\nThe saving grace is likely for individual sales. From the times I've had go to the store to pick up our \""deliveries\"" (ie. nearly every time), it looked like they had a decent selection from the wall for cases...but who knows if they actually carry the selection."
2,"D's does the chicago style hot dog very well, they even use sport peppers which I can never find in the grocery store. The bun is steamed and features the quintessential poppy seed exterior.\n\nD's beer selection is also great but I'm not much of a beer drinker so it's not something I've ever focused on. The general consensus I've heard is that there is better selection elsewhere and the prices are a little high but you can't beat both their hot dogs and their beer selection at the same time, making them a great bar.\n\nTheir fries are so crispy that I suspect they're double fried. They're tasty and the toppings available can turn them into a bastard concoction of delicious, artery clogging glory. There's been nothing on D's menu that I've been disappointed with.\n\nThe service can be a little hit or miss due mostly to the sheer amount of business they do on a Friday or Saturday night."
1,"I don't understand the hype for D's, although I guess their beer selection *does* rule.  If selection drives your decision-making, definitely head on over.  However, if you'd like to receive anything other than slow, resentful service from your waitstaff, or food that is anything above sub-par, head on by without stopping.  I've lived just down Forbes from D's for 3 yrs, and walk down there with friends a lot during the summer and early fall.  I'm also a former bartender and waitress, so I can say with experience and certainty that I've received just downright terrible service there about 80% of the times I've been.  Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.  Upstairs, expect about the same level of service, with a douchy element of annoyed resentment from the bartender, along with even douchy-ier clientele. \n\nI know D's is a favorite neighborhood place, but I'm tired of the abuse from waitstaff who look annoyed that I'm even there.  If this was just a once-in-a-while occurrence, I'd be forgiving, but 3 years is long enough to judge."
4,What a place. What a selection.  I love it.  \n\nThis place allows you to view hundreds of beers from around the world.  You can buy mixed six packs as well. \n\nThe food is great and service is just fine.
1,"The place smells awful.   Its non-smoking, but reeks of stale smoke, and when I spend 1/2 an hour there, I leave smelling like smoke.  This isn't an isolated incident, but it really smells every time I've been in there (at least once a month for the past couple years).\n\non the up side: decent coffee, decent assorted snacks (pastries, sandwiches, etc.), great location."
0,"My guess is that \""Ruth K.\"" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a \""business\"" only prepares food (chicken/tuna salad, hummus) once a week?  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!\n\nBTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.\n\nAdded note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there."
3,"MUCH nicer since the renovation! The only thing I don't love is that there are rarely baskets near the entrance, and it's weird how you have to go through the whole produce area to get to the rest of the store!\n\nCheckers are usually friendly here, and good selection and variety."
1,"Nothing special, it is Kmart after all.  \n\nDeals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  I can relate, I did my time in retail.  Although I left it when my time was due.  \n\nGood for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area."
2,Spent the weekend and Pittsburgh and started out Friday night at Mad Mex for Happy Hour and some dinner. Happy Hour was a pretty good deal with half price wings and cheap drafts. The wings were good and the beer selection is above average.\n\nFor dinner I had the carnitas enchiladas (i think). It didn't taste bad but I definitely had better Mexican elsewhere even elsewhere in Pittsburgh.
4,"Stopped by with my laptop late last Friday afternoon to enjoy some craft brews and prep for a class I'm teaching Saturday morning.  Normally I have nothing but great things to say about Mad Mex in Scott Town Center, but I was mildly annoyed by a new server who seemed to abandon me after finding out I wished to stay and work after purchasing my meal and buying several craft brews.  This is not the normal treatment at this establishment for the guy at table #28 with the laptop.  In any case, great food & great selection of microbrews!"
2,"I'm always the first to say that I love Mad Mex.  I don't care that it's Tex Mex, just give me a supersized Dance Marathon Enchilada and I'm in dance party heaven!  \n\nWhat I was sad about at this location was the gauc,.  It was, how do you say....okay...it was just plain gross.  It tasted rotten!  Not the way you want your gauc to taste.  And for some reason I kept torturing myself by taking little bites to see what the heck was wrong with it!  The waitress, who was incredibly nice, took it back to see what was up with it.  She said she thought maybe it had too much lime in it.  I love lime and I don't really know how lime can make gauc taste rotten, but I was pretty bummed \n\nThe good?  My Dance Marathaon Enchilada, as always, was a party in my mouth!  And like I said, our waitress was super friendly and a great server!  She suggested to the seasonal Apple Cider Margarita.  I excited and scared all at once!  I've been digging the ciders lately, but in a marg?  A little scary.  First sip tasted a bit like cinnamon apple sauce.  A tad weird.  A couple sips later, I was into it.  I was also into caramel/sugar lining the rim of the glass!  \n\nSolid meal, I just missed the fresh, non weird tasting, gauc.  Until next time...practice safe Mex everyone!"
2,"This location has such a different feel than the others around Pittsburgh. Perhaps it's the well-lit bar, or maybe it's that there's a new bartender every time I make it over here. In any case, it doesn't quite have the \""feel\"" that North Hills and Robinson have."
2,Parking = terrible\nService = just ok\nFood = decent\nAtmosphere = really nice but loud\nDrinks = margaritas are ok\n\nComing here I wouldn't get anything else other than the burritos it fajitas. Really disappointed in the quesadilla I had here. Guacamole is pretty bland but the salsa has a nice spicy kick. Neat place to hang out if in the mood for Mexican like food and atmosphere.
2,"I do like my Mad Mex, however predictable and non-authentic it may be.  The portion sizes are mammoth and I come away with a satisfied sense of regret.  Their beer menu is happily extensive.  Charging me $9 for chips and salsa is a bit of crime, wouldn't ya say though!?!  I mean, c'mon!  Our service has most times been lacking--a bit rushed and on the inattentive side.  Also, why do you require your wait staff to not servestraws/ lemons/etc unless asked by cusotmers---weirdness-cut out these odd cost-cutting, anti-service friendly measures please."
2,Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.
2,"The close-to-my-childhood-home Starbucks: it's A. Not Peet's, and B. An accidental high school reunion when I dare to venture in. On the other hand, there are usually couches--or chairs and tables--available, inside or outside, depending on the season.\n\nThis is the option when I don't want to try to park on Beverly for a caffeine fix at the Coffee Tree."
2,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a hotel during my one night stay in Pittsburgh. Close to the city, but far enough out to get free parking and a reasonable rate (under $100).\n\nThe room was fairly small, but I was only planning on sleeping in it. It was clean so I couldn't ask for much more. The people at the front desk were very friendly too.\n\nIf I go back to Pittsburgh, I will absolutely stay here again."
4,"We are new to the area. We bought a 100 year old home in the Dormont suburb of Pittsburgh and set about to do a serious renovation. The moment we walked into Ceramiche we knew we were in good hands. Tina, Bob, Melissa, Suzy and Nicky all know their stuff and treat us like long lost friends. The selection of tile is the best we have found in this area and the prices are very good. The service is what really makes this place special."
4,"Great bagels, sandwiches, soup, and coffee!\nMy favorites are the veg-out bagel sandwich, the bagel dog on onion, and their sour cream potato salad is so good too.\nIf you like all beef hotdogs, you should try the bagel dog. They wrap bagel around the dog. When they heat it up, the juice soaks into that chewy bagel and it is heaven.  Mmm."
3,A good Starbucks.  There is always a line at this one due to it's location but they do a great job of getting people served quickly.  Today I had a salted camel mocha.  It was pretty amazing.\n\nThis location also has a fireplace which is a nice touch for cold days.
2,"Ok so my first experience at princess nails could be described as slightly awkward but totally worth it. When I went into the salon I didn't realize how cramped it actually was it didn't look too clean to be honest. But anyway I had called earlier in the week to see if they took appointments and they told me they didn't so I walked in to get my eyebrows waxed. When I arrived I said what I wanted done not knowing that I had to sit further up near the waxing chair to be waited on next before some woman cut ahead of me. But when I actually did get my eyebrows waxed by this older asian woman who went by michelle I believed she did a fantastic job of thinning out my eyebrows and surprisingly after telling her \""thinner\"" 5 times she made them absolutely stunning and for only 10 dollars. Although its not much to look at when you go in getting my eyebrows waxed at Princess Nails was the best decision I ever made.\n\n*NOTE* My rating is based on Eyebrow Waxing. Unfortunately I do not get my nails done. EVER. So please keep in mind when reading my review for this location that it is solely based on my experience with waxing and waxing ONLY."
3,Like I said before in my first post about Princess Nails. Its definitely dingy and and as hole in the wall as you can get. But Michelle oh my is this woman amazing. Second visit to get my eyebrows waxed was just as worthwhile as the first. ASK FOR MICHELLE. I'm not going to rate this 5 stars simply because of the lack of cleaniness BUT what would they do without Michelle.\n\n*NOTE* My rating is based on Eyebrow Waxing. Unfortunately I do not get my nails done. EVER. So please keep in mind when reading my review for this location that it is solely based on my experience with waxing and waxing ONLY.
4,"I went to M.C.N salon because I had seen positive reviews on Yelp. I have to say the reviews were right. It was one of the best salon experiences I've ever had. The salon itself is beautiful and very inviting. The receptionist was so warm and genuinely friendly. I recently changed stylists for something new which I was wary of  doing.  I decided to try one of their junior stylists, Elizabeth. Everyone should go to see her! She gives a great first impression which is reassuring because nothing makes me more nervous than a stylist who is not put together or whose haircut and/or color is whack. \n\n I came in a hot mess and I left feeling and looking a 100% better. My hair is really thick and was driving me crazy in the heat. She did a great job thinning it out and giving me layers without sacrificing length. My head literally felt lighter. Plus, the blow out she gave me was so glamorous. I've never seen my hair look like that before! She was really patient and explained the products and how she was styling my hair. I would recommend her to anyone. She's really professional and great at her job!"
4,"You've got to book with Liz!\n\nIf you have curly hair (or even not) she is the best in the burgh.  Nails it every time.  Love her personality and attention to detail.  I really feel like she listens to what I want but will tell me what she thinks, in a kind way. She's energetic, attentive, and just really knows hair.  \n\nHave been back multiple times and each time I leave happy: cut, color, and all.  Probably the first time i've actually stuck with a stylist.  Thanks Liz!"
0,"Today, I definitely didn't have a great experience at MCN. I got my haircut couple months ago from there and I liked it, so I decided to go again for coloring today.\nI wasn't happy about it at all -cuz I can still see the line btw my root and the bottom. PLUS, they charged me 25 bucks more for the blow-dry without telling me. I wish I didnt go there for the color.."
2,"4th of July... everything is packed so of course there was a wait, for a table of 12.  There really wasn't anywhere to actually wait, and even though many of us ordered from the bar, we got the distinct feeling that we were not welcome to linger while waiting for our table, so we were in the way of the wait staff no matter where we tried to cram ourselves.  \n\nThe food was good though.  I had a buffalo chicken wrap and it was good.  However, someone at our table was charged for extra ketchup... what is that about?!  Glad I didn't ask for extra buffalo sauce as usual.  \n\nDespite these issues, we were served in a timely fashion and the food was better than I expected because of the reviews.  It is pricier than it should be for the quality but still better than I expected."
2,"Just your typical hotel-restaurant. \n\nThey offer great happy hour and daily drink specials. \n\nAtmosphere was nice. Part restaurant, part sports bar. \n\nFood was average. Had the shrimp-crab bisque to start, which was easily the best thing I had that night. Then did a French dip sandwich for dinner, as there wasn't many \""dinner\"" choices that intrigued me, and also the precious reviews of dinner dishes weren't good. Sandwich wasn't very good, typical bar cuisine though. Girlfriend had the chicken broccoli pasta, which was excessively cheesy. \n\nOverall, it's not bad, but won't knock your socks off. It certainly benefits by the lack of other restaurants near it."
3,"Came in on Monday for some pre concert drinks and dinner. We were greeted nicely at the door and got sat in a booth, which I love :) our server was Jess, she was very nice and attentive to all of our needs. I was never there before and she helped me pick out drinks from the menu and had great recommendations.  We had Mac and cheese bites as an app, so good!! Then for dinner I had the turkey club and my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken wrap, all very yummy :) she even brought me a small sample of the black bean salad I was wondering about for the sides. The few different people who ran the food to our table were very pleasant also, a very nice staff all around. We had a nice time and would definitely go back again !!! :)"
1,"I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.\n\nI tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque, the halibut, and the pork-chop with coleslaw.  The lobster bisque was bland and cold.  The halibut was decent.  The pork chop was so bitter and dry.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of the place seemed standoff-ish and was not friendly.  Furthermore, it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way, she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here."
0,"For a place that has a $75 entree I was pretty shocked to see a $2 charge for blue cheese olives on my bill... pretty tacky.   That was definitely a first.  I was disappointed the waitress didn't say anything either. Aside from that the service was pretty good... and the sashimi was a great value.  But everything else about this place is shwag.  The seared tuna - garbage, rainbow roll and Caesar salad - weak,  and the sides incredibly small.  The place has the feel of a riverboat buffet.  If this was stand alone they would only get away with charging 40% of what they are now... in the Westin.\nI would skip it, or if you have to, get sashimi at the bar and make sure you review your bill."
2,"The restaurant is located in the lobby of the Westin.  I was staying at the hotel but avoided the restaurant given that it was less than 3 stars on YELP.  The last night, I was tired and worked until 9PM, so decided to give it a try.\n\nThe menu itself is good.  They have seafood and sushi and there were plenty of dishes that caught my eye, though settled on a couple of sushi rolls.\n\nThe sushi rolls were good, and they have a good draught beer selection.  From a food perspective, I would give it a 3.5 stars, approaching four, but then I only had the sushi.  Still, just based on food, I'll try it again.\n\nHowever, where it may get a bad reputation is service, which isn't very good.  The bar was about half full, otherwise the restaurant was at most 10% occupied.  Still, anyone sitting at the bar had to wave to the bartender to get his attention, and it took about 25 minutes for my two rolls to come out.  That might explain the 2.5 star rating.\n\nSince I'll likely be staying at this Westin for awhile, probably will try it again."
0,"I never ate here nor could have possibly gotten a drink no one would wait on me.\n\nMy friend who wanted to be a socialite of some kind asked me to come with her. I don't know what she was thinking. Not my scene whatsoever! We had come from a free Devo concert. I was dressed in converses,  a side pony tale, and bright pink 80's garb. \n\nI have never seen so many idiots occupying one space. The chicks looked at me like I was an alien. Not everyone needs to wear 5 inch heels, gobs of makeup, and clothes that is so tight that your breathing is impaired just to get a little cleavage popping out of a minuscule ugly dress.\n\n I like fashion, I love heals. It was the glassy, vapid, duplicates that I saw that made me give my friends a hug and kiss then seriously BOLT out the door! Super bad energy in this place. I jumped in the first cab I saw and headed to Lawrenceville. I didn't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there. Smoke bomb disappeared! She knew I would hate it but just didn't want to go alone. I was pissed.\n\nThe night was not lost. My awesome \""fiends\"" from LA (stunt man Curtze, and Elvis impersonator slash gangster screen writer) met me out and we dive bar-ed the rest of the evening away. I meant to write \""friends\"" but didn't change it because fiends, haha... much more appropriate. \n\nI am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort. Some of my favorite people like Bossa Nova. Just stating my personal experience."
2,"Went on a Friday evening for cocktails. I ordered a gin martini, it was delicious. For a snack we ordered pan seared scallops in a strawberry basil sauce. We were so surprised when the huge sea scallops were put in front of us! They were cooked perfectly and the sauce was bright and fresh, and for only $12! \n\nThe reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of the atmosphere. This place is set up weird, and there were only 2 or 3 full tables in the \""dining room\"". The crowd was full of 40 somethings and there was a cover band, playing all the hits from the 70's and 80's. We didn't stay long."
4,"I always had a good experience eating here for lunch.  Yea it is a bit run down, but name some in the strip that aren't?  They have $5.00 lunch specials and Jimmy was always very nice and the huge stogies in his mouth just took me back.  Funny.. Highly recommend."
3,"The PAT buses aren't nearly as bad as many Pittsburghers make it to be. People complain about having to do transfers downtown, etc... - The reality is, it a decent system!! They could have more frequent rotations of buses at different routes, but Pittsburgh's public transportation - the buses, the T, etc... is a good system that works well for a city that is built on some mountains with a poor lay out of roads, etc... its not going to run as efficiently as areas that are built on a grid system that makes logical sense - its more difficult to get around everything. Gotta give them some slack!! and The bus drivers have always been great too!"
0,"The only pro about Port Authority is it gets you from point a to point b. \n\nI've had buses that smell like pee. I've had buses where the bus drivers are yelling at drivers or people downtown. Screaming insults out the window.  Had a bus driver doing like 70mph down McKnight road. \nAt least twice a week I get a bus that's farebox is broke.  Yeah a free ride is nice but port authority is always crying wanting to increase their already ridiculous fare prices. Routes are always getting cut which leaves buses jam packed. \n\nThey introduce the connect card (an alternative to cash and passes. If I load $20.00 onto the card I should be able to get a transfer without entering cash the drivers don't know that and argue about it.  Feel free to train your employees. \n\nOn an 80 degree day one buses heat was on full blast. Not the drivers fault. He finally pulled over restarted the bus and it read 98 degrees before the air worked.\n\nBuses are late all the time.  When going to work I need to leave at least an hour before I should have to, to ensure I get to work on time. \n\nI can go on forever..."
1,"If you like filthy buses, super high fares and about 50% rude operators then you will love Port Authority service.  Now if you like clean buses, reasonable fares and friendly service you will need to go somewhere else.  And no place for children as the language on the buses would make a sailor blush.  And in 14 years of riding Port Authority I have never seen a uniformed Port Authority officer riding a bus."
0,Awful!!!\nNever EVER follows schedule! Lets you wait for literally over an hour on a bus that is supposed to be running every 15 min.
0,"How is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway, but can't update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at? I waited two hours today in the freeZing cold to get to work. Had to call off it was just to cold out!"
1,"I must admit that not being from Pittsburgh, I walked into this place with very different expectations for what a \""cheesesteak\"" sandwich constituted. Having said that, while the inclusion of an enormous amount of fries and coleslaw on the sandwich was great, the tiny piece of beef \""patty\"" that can only be described as something they use as a weight watchers/jenny craig portion leaves much to be desired. I honestly felt like I was eating some sort of vegetarian sandwich with a tiny piece of shriveled up beef patty lost somewhere in between the enormous slices of Italian bread.\n\nOn the plus side, the Oakland location does have a pretty sweet deal for after 10pm, where a sandwich and drink was 3 or 4 bucks."
1,"Primanti's sandwiches pretty much sum up Pittsburgh in many ways:  big, over-the-top, tasteless, and unhealthy.  What more could you ask for? Unfortunately, this place is pretty dirty.  Make sure no flies land on your food.\n\nIt seems like Pittsburgh natives love this place, which is fine.  Its food certainly is unique.  However, if you're not from Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll walk away with a rather bland taste in your mouth.\n\nBy the way, do not pronounce the \""t\"" in Primanti.  It really irks native Pittsburghers.  It's pronounced \""Primanny.\""  Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way."
1,"Primanti Bros is basically the heart of all yinzers in Pittsburgh. However, I have to take primanti bros in doses. Their big ass sandwiches make me feel like I dont need to eat the rest of the week. Sometimes I love it for that and sometimes I hate it. Either way its a nice place to sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice cold beer with my friends. \n\n My only complaint about this particular primanti bros in market square is the people that it generates. Anywhere from hookers to crackheads. I have been in there several times and atleast 4 or 5 times I watched someone get kicked out for doing something illegal. My advice is, if you can, go to this primantis during the day for lunch dont go at night. If you can go to the one in the strip district or southside on 17th street."
3,"Tiny little place and very popular...highly suggest going early if you're a newbie in town and never had their sammiches before. They get pretty busy after 12.\n\nI couldn't decide what to get, and was told their number 2 popular choice is  not that great and I should try salami or black angus. Tough! So, I ended going with roast beef. I really enjoyed it, not greasy at all, and I actually ate the whole thing. Ha unbelievable, it was that good! \n\nOverall service was great."
3,"Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.  Pile on your choice of meat and cheese....then the grand finale....cole slaw and fries!  Then the put both hands on the sandwich and proceed to smoosh it all down flat. All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware! \n\nI don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique. \n\nIf you're visiting Pittsburgh, go here?  If you're new to Pittsburgh, go here! If you just need your fill of a sandwich with more sides on it than you usually order in a regular sitting, go here!"
1,"This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  \n\nThe restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me."
3,"This place was hard to find in the dark after a 5 day drive from Texas.\n\nFirst off, what's up with Pittsburgh and ginger ale?  I've never heard of any place serving ginger ale in a cup, bottle or can in Texas, but here it seems to be everywhere!  Every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended I try their ginger ale and it's really good!  So we all got that to drink.  \n\nTo start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me \""don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.\""  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.\n\nI got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich, the wife had the Philly, and the kids had corned beef and a ham.  We had seen the hundreds of TV shows about this place and we were finally here to see if the mix of coleslaw, fries and meat was really as awesome as they say it is.   They were right.   The sandwiches didn't seem as big as they were on TV but they were freakin' awesome.  We all enjoyed these sandwiches more than any sandwich we had ever had before.   We had just had a long day of eating tons of bacon and bacon booze, so I didn't think any of us would be able to finish a big sandwich.  WE DID.  It was soooo good.  \n\nThe only bad part about coming to Pittsburgh and visiting Primanti Bros is that we had to go back home the next day!"
1,"Always love Primanti's and I was Central Pittsburgh area, so I went for lunch. It was after the rush and wasn't too busy but the waitresses acted like it was. I was told to sit myself, which is cool since I wanted to sit outside. But then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me. Finally a third came and took my order. I got my usual.... pastrami, extra cheese, no tomato, add egg. When did she miss the \""no tomato\""? I got my sammich (eventually) and there was the tomato. I immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again MIA. She just disappeared again. I waited as long as I could but she never came back. I finally carried the sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back into the restaurant myself and told the cook I needed a new piece of bread. He gave it to me with a funny look, then I ate my sammich, and then five minutes later the waitress finally showed up. Until then she was just missing. I was so annoyed, but when she came back it was just to refill my drink. A few minutes later I needed my bill, but guess what, she was gone again! I had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it. I was really annoyed. Love me some Primantis but the Market Square one has terrible service."
0,"Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster, tasteless food.\n\nAte at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9), but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory, bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.\n\nWe also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day, but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning, explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.\n\nThe legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here, but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch."
0,"There was basically no cheese on my \""cheese combo sandwich\"", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us."
3,"People knock on this place - but I always find myself defending it. \n\nWhile it may be overrated for being featured on the food network, it is a pretty good sandwich place (no not just because the portions...while they are generous) \n\nThe fries are a bit bland but I'm a huge fan of the cole slaw they have there - while it may not be anything \""special\"" it's a classic (not creamy cole slaw mind you). The colossal fish sandwich is pretty good. The cheese steak is not a cheese steak! But that's because I'm from Philadelphia and any cheese steak that isn't made and prepared there is not a cheese steak to me. \n\nThe only thing is the sanitation there is...questionable.  Just don't think about the sticky surfaces and slimy-ish floors. \n\nFor a cheap, giant sandwich I'd take the germs any day."
2,"Had to visit the \""Famous\"" Primanti Brother's Bar and Grill during my first visit to Pittsburgh, but most likely will only go back if my friends/family really  want to eat there.\n\nFood:  The portions are huge, not very greasy, served nice and hot but over all very bland.  I got the Colossal Fish and Cheese sandwich.  The beer batter fish was a very large piece and by itself was not bad tasting at all (just a little under seasoned.)  The fries were limp and had no seasoning what so ever. The fries were the worse part of the sandwich.  The coleslaw was  very mild, sweet and vinegar base, and by itself it was ok, but put everything together between two slices of white bread and it made for a bland pile of flavorless starch.  The bread was also too soft and did not hold up well at all, and the cheese was nonexistent.  I ended up having to add a ton of salt, pepper and malt vinegar to my sandwich, picked it apart and ate the pieces with my fingers.\n\nPrice:  For the size of the portions you get, the price is great!  I got two sandwiches and a soda for about $16.  Their sandwiches range from around $6 - $8 each, and are a good value since you will definitely leave full (I took home left overs.)\n\nAtmosphere:  After reading a few reviews about the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was not packed with tourist.  For being such a small dinner, the place was fairly empty so I was able to sit anywhere I liked (being a solo traveler, restaurants often try to stick me at the bar but I prefer to sit at a table.)  The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.\n\nStaff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.\n\nOver all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.  I would rather get a sandwich that is half the size with more flavor, then a huge pile of bland food."
2,"This is a neither a yay or nay place for me.  Understanding the underlying concept of the sandwiches from way back when, can make a person appreciate Primanti's for what they are.\n\nI ordered the pastrami served on two thick slices of bread, layered with french fries and cole slaw.  Granted, I like my carbs, but this was overload for me.  I wasn't particularly fond of the cole slaw either.  \n\nI think this is more of an acquired taste kind of place.  Not that I wouldn't go back, it's okay for an occasional visit.  There are other sandwiches to try.  But if you're used to the true pastrami with Swiss on rye, I wouldn't recommend the sandwich here.\n\nThe place itself is small and good for a group of four.  Eight if you don't mind sitting at two separate tables that are relatively close to each other."
2,"I wanted Pittsburgh food, and the internets sent me here.  Do not be intimidated to walk in this dump.  I went to the take out line and ordered a spicy sandwich something or another.  The bartenders are either overworked or just don't give a shit cause I waited for a while before ordering.  But stay strong, and look them down until they take your order. PS make sure you get sauce in those little packets.  Sammich is at best 6/10 but is comes with fries on the sandwich, fries!! Isn't that crazy everyone, fries on a sandwich!"
1,"I just moved here back in September and one of the first places i was told to go for great food was Primanti Bros. The food was great as I was told from several people from the area and back home.\n\nWhat I was not happy with was the setting policy and service. Just to get a seat here I had to wait standing up watching people eat like a creepy stalker just to see who would get up first and finally when I got a seat no one cleaned our table for a while or even took our order cause no one even knew we had been seated. If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card. It took so long and with other people looking at us to get the hell up so they could sit we just walked in to retrieve the card at was just sitting on the back of the bar and had not yet been processed so I had to wait again.\n\nFood can only get you so far, so my suggestion is if you want a good Food and can wait an hour feel free and come here. If you don't have the time just go next door to the Subway."
3,"Primantis is the ideal Pittsburgh sandwich. Fries, coleslaw, provolone, whatever meat you'd like in between the famous mancinis bread. I love this location especially because of the hours. Living downtown it's hard to find places to eat late at night but the market Sqaure primantis is open till 12 o'clock 7 days a week. I've tried variations of the sandwich but my favorite so far is the pastrami. I went tonight and I'll be back again the near future."
1,"Bread, slaw, tomato, fries, and a small piece of overcooked fish all piled together. Warm yiengling and mediocre service.   Aweful"
4,"This spot was the light of my life for about 3 solid weeks. From the first bite I could tell that parting ways with Pittsburgh would be heartbreaking. After driving out of pittsburgh and paying my friend for his leftover half a sandwich, I knew that id made a special connection. To that bacon egg and cheese waiting for me, I miss xou and cant wait to hold xou again."
2,"I would give it 3.5 stars. It was a solid sandwich for sure. I got the corned beef which was tasty the only thing I wish they added was some kind of sauce. I'm not sure if that comes on other sandwiches but it could have used some kind of mustard. The price is great too, four sandwiches , two orders of pickles, coleslaw, fries and beer for about 40 bucks. Can't complain about that! \n\nI would definitely"
2,"I found the sandwich I ate at Primanti Bros to be quite tasty!  As others have mentioned, the signature toppings of cole slaw (which I normally loathe, but, in this case, loved!), french fries and cheese accompany any of your \""meat\"" choices for a sandwich.  The menu is limited, and there are no frills or false pretenses here.  I would definitely eat here again!  I had the fish and cheese sandwich, and it was outstanding!  I can't give the place 5 stars, because it didn't completely wow me, and the others in my party were a little disappointed.  I think they may have just made bad choices for their \""meat\"" (kielbasa and the Pittsburgher), but I doubt I could get them to try it again.  But hey for only a little over $6 per sandwich, can one really complain?  Delicious!  I'll go back without 'em.  ;)  Not a lot of tables, and not even sure it's air conditioned, so don't bring your fancy clothes or your roaming toddler.  ;)"
4,"Today was the day we finally got to try this place!\n\nI was in the mood for a cheesesteak and the waitress suggested an angus sandwich.  While it was different from a cheesesteak that im used to, it was definitely delicious! However I would get the coleslaw on the side next time.  She suggested a Cajun chicken sandwich for my husband  (because he said he liked a little spice) he absolutely loved it! we washed it all down with a local IPA.\nAll in all great food, definitely worth the visit-- and great service! Our waitress happened to be from Harrisburg ( that's where we are from!) so we shared some really great conversation!!"
2,"This is a solid downtown lunch break spot. They run a special between like 11-2 where you can get 3 cuts buffet style (with lots of different types) with a pop for 6 or 7 bucks. Perfect for those days when you oversleep and don't get a chance to pack a lunch. The pizza is nothing that you'd fall asleep dreaming of, but definitely hits the spot at 1PM on a workin' day."
3,"Being originally from Arizona, I know a good taco.  The taco stand outside of Reyna's is GOOD.   The carne asada meat was tender, though I usually prefer a little more char. A friend i was with got the beef tongue, a little too eccentric for my taste, but he loved it.  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the tortilla.  I am usually tuned off by corn tortillas, but theirs are soft, not dry, and don't fall apart as the taco juices seep in. In other words exactly what you need for a good street taco.  The best part is the taco barrista squeezes fresh lime juice on top of the taco as a finishing touch. It really puts it over the top."
1,"This has always been my 'go to' place to buy the most awesome, authentic flour tortillas.  I always  bought them fresh, still warm at times.  I have often served them at my  home and have sent many friends to shop there. Yesterday, I raved about how wonderful they were to a total stranger and we both bought 2 packages from 'the fridge up front'.  I was so so very disappointed and if the person I 'sold' them to reads YELP, I apologize. They were dry and stale.  Steaming them made them somewhat edible, but.....\nWhich leads to my next review....\nI was so excited when they opened their restaurant as they sell  such tasty tacos on the street.  I have been there 3 times.  First off, THE  BEST margarita!  Food ok but service......horrible!!  The most efficient wait staff appears to be a 10-12 year old boy who has made our guacamole and aims to please.  When we were there over the weekend, the waiter outside  could do nothing more than tell us how busy he was and how he had to take the steps with each order. He got our salsa order wrong so needless to say, we left. \nThis makes me sad to write this. Did they bite off more than  they can chew?"
1,"I've lived in Pittsburgh for what feels like forever and in all of that time, I guess I've never been to the Strip District on a Monday. We didn't realize most of the restaurants are closed on Mondays. Tried Thin Man, closed. Luke Wholey's, closed. We read some less than appealing outdoor menus of a few spots and settled on Roland's Seafood Grill for lunch because they were open and had a sign out front raving about their signature warm Lobster Rolls for $14.99. Ok, we were game.\n\nWe've driven hours off the beaten path in Maine for amazing Lobster Rolls at Red's Eats, which sets the standard for what all lobster rolls should be. Massive amounts of fresh lobster piled on top of the bun and drawn butter to dip the excess mound of lobster in is a mouth watering delight! \n\nThat couldn't be farther from what you get served at Roland's. The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good. Considering I skipped the fries, shouldn't the server have asked if I wanted extra coleslaw knowing it was going to be minuscule? \n\nThe upstairs patio was really nice overlooking Penn Ave. and I hear they have a decent happy hour with terrific specials on fresh oysters and beer at the bar. I may give this place another shot based on that but, never again on their lobster roll."
1,"I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary."
0,"WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said  '' There's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better ."
1,"Like a glutton for punishment, I hit up Roland's again last night while in town for business. I tired Kaya, but the wait was 30 + minutes.\n\nHere's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room, which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside. \n\nI had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before, it was just OK.  Service was better this time though. \n\nAll in all, I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal. \n\nSave your money and try somewhere else. \n\nPS. Beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world."
0,"Ugh if I could give this place -10 stars I would. What a nightmare. To start, the first time I ate here, I almost swallowed a giant shard of plastic that was in my salad. Then to my horror, the bar tending goes \""whoops.\"" and tosses it on the floor!! \n\nFast forward a couple months, I decide to give this place a second chance. (I must have been delirious from hunger.)\nFirst off the bar tender was rude, slow as hell and terrible at making drinks. My friend and myself order our food and 20 min later out comes my friends food. After almost an hour of waiting, I still had NO pizza. When I asked the cranky pants bar tender in the NICEST possible way, where it was, he just shrugged and walked away. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was \""busy.\"" Finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half I got my shitty pizza. \nThank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer. But, to the bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED."
4,"I have no complaints here.  European-style shop for gourmet coffee and tea.  You can buy fresh-brewed coffee or beans and loose leaf tea in bulk starting with a 1/4 pound and up.  Besides that, the shop is crammed with coffee and tea supplies, candies, and chocolates.  Good prices.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff.\n\nI usually buy coffee, but the last time I went in for green tea and wanted to try something new.  The man who waited on me didn't know a whole lot about tea, so he did something amazing:  he found someone else who did!\n\nTip: Go on Thursday afternoons when Market Square has their farmer's market and pick up some fresh produce and pierogies, too."
3,"I cannot count how many times I walked right past Nicholas Coffee Co, smelling the aroma of fresh roasted peanuts I love roasted peanuts, they're like my favorite food.  I remember the windows being very busy, and busy windows tend to scare me, like I cannot guess what's going on inside. After reading the Yelp reviews of Nicholas Coffee and co, and getting Downtown after 4:30pm I decided to go in.  \nI have fallen in love. This coffee shop had a frozen Chai on the menu, I am going on my lunch break tomorrow for that. The barista was smiling and seemed happy to be of service.\nOn this visit I played it safe and got a iced latte with vanilla flavoring, omg it was so delicious. Refreshing sweet and energizing.  I cannot wait until my next visit to this coffee shop, it was really a treat. \n\nOne entire wall was lined with tea!!! There were roasted nuts of all kinds, honey and huge variety of coffees. Shame on me for not giving this place a change earlier, now it's time to play catch up :)"
4,"So Many coffees to choose from, so little time. Really awesome coffee shoppe, which happens to be the oldest in the city and the most delicious smelling! They staff here is super friendly and enthusiastic about the precious beans. Its quaint and charming with a old rustic touch. Prices are reasonable and what you'd expect. Definitely a good place to stop if your around market square"
4,I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!
2,"Not the best ever, but pretty decent stuff.  A slice for $2.50 in downtown? I'll be back."
1,"This is the first time in a long while (10 yrs?) and now I remember why. The food is fair at best for the main meal. The salad is good but small. The hummus is a little bland. The best parts were the \""homemade\"" wine, both white and red, kinda like adult kool-aid  and the Jackie O cake was great. My issue was the price, $59. for dinner for 2. For this price, I would have expected more.I can't believe the 4 and 5 star reviews that I have read on this site. It's hard to believe that this place rates so many opposing reviews. I will never go back here again."
1,"So our intentions were to eat at the Indian place across the street however a lady ran across the street and started rattling off the menu as we were walking. At first I liked her moxy, but soon realized that if this is how they need to bring in customers we may be in trouble. Another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in. Our dinner conversation was constantly interrupted by the servers yelling across the street and on the side walk at potential customers. \n\nNow on to the food:\n\nI ordered the chicken kabob. Very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled. I didn't finish it.  The rice was good and the side veggies weren't bad. The spinach pie was ok. \n\nThey will ask \""would you like hummus to snack on before your meal\"". This is not free or included. I figured this so I wasn't caught off guard. Some people I could see will be surprised at the end when they get the bill. \n\nMy wife got the lamb kabob. Bland again and very chewy. It didn't taste fresh, almost frozen at one point and microwaved. The cheese pie was pretty bad.\n\nHummus was ok. \n\n2 stars for the food\n3 stars for service\n1 star for the experience with yelling and fishing for customers. Seems like they may be in trouble financially and could be cutting corners to stay afloat. \n\nI will not go again. Alihan's next door is amazing, I recommend them over Christo's every day."
0,"I had spaghetti warehouse delivered to my apt and I ordered spaghetti and meatballs while my boyfriend ordered chicken Parmesan. First off, we both asked for Caesar salads (which we paid extra for) and we didn't even get them. Besides that, the sauce was less than mediocre - a glorified ketchup with noodles. The chicken was dry and we couldn't eat half of the meals. Overall, very poor experience with spaghetti warehouse. You're better off getting fast food noodles from noodles and company. Seriously disappointed especially since it is called the SPAGHETTI warehouse. Very hard to mess up spaghetti."
0,"No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked, mushy noodles, watery tomato gravy, and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously, Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. \n\nAgain, my advice to any Italian food lover, find a good neighborhood, family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate."
0,"Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food."
4,"Visited Morton's last night for dinner before the show. After we were seated, our waiter greeted us shortly after with the menus. The menu has a perfect amount of options. Not too many and still enough to have a complete variety. Chicken, chops, seafood, and most important, STEAK! For a salad, we started off with the chopped spinach salad. It was perfect, as I am very particular with how my salads are dressed. The dressing wasn't dripping off, it was evenly and perfectly coated. I chose the 6 oz filet mignon, with 2 bacon wrapped scallops and 3 grilled shrimp for my dinner. It was more than enough. The steak was so tender and juicy! I would definitely go back to Morton's again and again for a wonderful meal!"
1,"After an unpleasant experience at Lotus Grocery on 17 February 2014, I want to caution customers to be careful when paying with cash at the store.  \n\nMy order was $3.08.  I gave the glum and cold middle aged female cashier $10.10.  She put the $10 bill in the till and gave me $2.02 change, which would have been correct had I given her a $5 bill.  I told her that I gave her a ten dollar bill, and she repeatedly insisted that I did not.\n\nI went to the mean middle aged man who appears to be manager or owner and told him of the problem.  He was not interested in hearing it and it eventually fell into the lap of a short, middle aged woman who also appears to be manager, and is one of the nicer people on the staff.\n\nI got nowhere until I asked that a count of the register receipts.  The woman who  appears to be in management suggested that I leave my phone number and that I would be called after the store closes and a count is completed. That was not acceptable to me. I asked that a count be conducted while I waited and she agreed.  As she counted and recounted, I waited patiently.  She ultimately concluded that I was right and gave me my $5.00.  She apologized multiple times; the clerk who would have cheated me out of $5 did not.\n\nI will be careful when shopping at this store.  I will try to pay with one dollar bills in the future and will announce how much money I am handing to the cashier. There is a bitter taste in my mouth about Lotus Grocery.  Of all places for this to happen, it would have to be one where there is a language barrier and where most of the employees are dismissive of the customer.  This is not Giant Eagle!"
1,"I was walking back and forth through downtown over a series of days and saw Madonna's. I made it a point to tell myself that I should stop in and get myself something to eat. I love Tex-Mex food and am always looking for new places to patronize. \n\nI stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go. When I received my order I immediately opened it to take a bite. I was immediately underwhelmed. I saw that they had some Tapatio and added it to the full course of my burrito and took my leave of the little corner store.\n\nThe best part of the burrito was the Tapatio that I added after the fact. The issues with it were myriad. My biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste. That's right, my burrito had no flavor. How do you make a steak burrito with guacamole and pinto beans without any flavor what-so-ever in any of the components? Not far behind that question was the fact that my steak burrito had almost no steak. It was all beans and guacamole. Don't get me wrong, I like beans and guacamole when they are properly made, but I ordered a STEAK burrito and not a bean burrito seasoned with a few pieces of meat.\n\nI might try this place again to give it another chance, but I would stay away from the steak burrito and would most likely eat vegan that day just to see if the lack of flavor was situational."
1,"Well, it's food!! That's about all I can say for The Smithfield Cafe.  \nI had the \""daily special\"" which is pretty much the universal way of condensing \""two eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast\"" into two words. Sausage was room temperature, eggs were decent, and the greasy home fries contained the flavor of the dozen meals that were cooked before mine this morning (not i'n a good way). Coffee was plentiful, but not flavorful. \nThe waitresses were grizzled and archetypal for their profession.  \nTo surmise; meh..."
2,"I remember back circa 1991 when I was a freshman in high school, everybody read IN PITTSBURGH.  It was THE free weekly newspaper and it had the concerts, comic strips, and news features that the Post Gazette and the Tribune Review would not touch.  Somewhere along the line, probably when I was a junior or so, the new kid PITTSBURGH CITY PAPER came along.  I didn't think it would survive.  After all, Pittsburgh didn't need TWO of the same thing.\n\nWell, I was wrong.  IN PITTSBURGH is no more and the PITTSBURGH CITY PAPER is the source for alternative news and such that IN PITTSBURGH used to provide.  I was never one for the news that these types of papers provide.  I like to read CITY PAPER'S take on things.  But these papers are best for concert reviews, happenings around town, and movie reviews."
4,Wonderful experience!
1,"average at best. Best view of the city by far though. Go in summer or no point in going. \n\nThe beer battered fish is good, yet there's much better in the city. It's nice and crispy, served on a fresh roll, tartar, lettuce, all that jazz. However again it's not worth venturing over for unless weather is perfect for an evening outside. \n\nChicken quesidilla, same thing. Average. \n\nI've went for 6 years now waiting for it to become something good. It's not going to happen. But I'll keep trying hoping."
0,"Rotten food and over charging customer.\n\nI was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant, but was greatly disappointed. The restaurant charged me 20% premium over prices on online menu (I ordered takeout), denied there are prices online. The maitre D was reluctant to show the printed menu, which is 10% more expensive than online, led me to think the over charge was deliberate. \nThe crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from ROTTEN crab. Since I didn't have time to walk 10min one way to return the food, it had to be thrown away.   A lunch over charged and wasted."
1,They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine.
0,"It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \""we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\"" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real."
0,"The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables, next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry, sloppy, soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow, inattentive, and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value, a nicer atmosphere, and quality food, I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay."
3,"I went here on the day of a wedding (I'm from out of town) for a last minute pedicure. I didn't really know where else to go, so I just stopped here on a whim (it was raining and this was the closest place that seemed to do nails). \n\nThe Salon Nuvo nail person is FANTASTIC (and wonderful to chat with). It's two full weeks later and it looks like my pedicure is brand new (and before you ask, I actually used the exact same brand/color nail polish as my prior crap pedicure). They don't have the cool massage chairs and they put you in a weird little intimate back room, HOWEVER I would totally give that up for a beautiful pedicure that lasts this long.  \n\nThought it was worth a review."
4,i have been getting my hair cut here for 15 years.  Marjorie is amazing and priceless.  I am as picky about my hairstylist as i am my dentist or doctor.  I travel extensively for work and get compliments no matter where i travel.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!
4,"When it comes to the high-end chain steakhouses, Morton's and Capital Grille are great.  They consistently deliver great steaks and dependable apps, sides, and desserts.  However, my first and forever true love for steaks will always be Ruth's Chris.  I can still remember my first trip there in high school after my buddy's dad took us there to celebrate graduation.  As the 500 degree plate came out with the glorious aroma of perfectly cooked meat sizzling in butter, I knew I was not only in for something special, but a livelong love.\n\nRuth's Chris is a franchise and the setting in different cities can be quite variable.  The Philadelphia Ruth's Chris is right next to the Academy of Music with gas lamps lighting Broad St.  The Boston's Ruth's Chris is in old city hall with a beautiful ceiling 2 stories up in the bar area.  Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding in all their restaurants.\n\nMy recent venture to Ruth's Chris was with 4 other young men in a \""guys night out.\""  I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris amazingly allows you to do this.  We started with the seared Ahi tuna.  It was raw, thick, and delicious.  Actually, it kind of tasted like steak.\n\nWe each went on to get various cuts of meat.  I personally rolled with my favorite:  NY Strip, medium rare (correctly done with a blood red center), extra butter.  The extra butter is key.  If you're going to roll with a decadent feast of steak, might as well pull out all the stops.  It was brought out absolutely perfect and delicious.  The table also shared the excellent huge family-style sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nOur server was extremely gracious.  She opened and decanted a couple of our bigger bottles as soon as we sat down to give them time to breathe.  They arranged for us to have a cab-van at the end of our meal to take us to our next location.  \n\nIf I was really searching for something negative to say, it's that I wish that the Pittsburgh Ruth's Chris was in a more extravagant setting like some bigger cities.  However, since the main menu is exactly the same, Ruth's Chris is forever my go-to location for a perfect steak dinner."
1,"We wanted to check out the gay scene in Pittsburgh and since we were staying downtown this seemed like a great place. Positives: doorman was nice and they played good music. \n\nNegatives: the lighting, the decor and the smoking. The smoking was really disgusting actually as the smell lingered in our hair and our clothes after we left; I think they should consider opening up a little smoking area, just a thought. As for drinks, we ordered lemon drop martinis and I know, this is so far from being a martini bar, but the bartender did a pretty great job.\n\nGlad we went, but we won't go back."
3,"The selection is pretty vast -- European, upscale specialty brands (up to $24 for a 3 oz bar!), bulk malt balls in 3 flavors that are wonderful, house-brand hot chocolate mix, and lots more. It's fun just to browse around and know all these choices exist."
4,"This is a LOVELY little breakfast/lunch shop!! Small, but a cozy atmosphere and friendly service! The smell is beyond enticing as you walk by.\nAfter much debating (which the employees patiently waited on), I chose the new Tuscan bagel littered with delicious herbs/seasoning and topped with the sun-dried tomato cream cheese - highly recommend!!! 'twas a savory and delicious experience.\n\nThey have a great hot coffee selection (4 delicious flavors, 1 being decaf). I mixed the vanilla hazelnut with the dark roast and added all of their spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla & cocoa) and a splash of milk (they have skim, 2% & half-and-half). For a small bottomless cup, it was only $1.79 plus tax!  I got the bagel free because I joined their rewards club.  Perfect way to start my day!! You shall not be disappointed by their broad selection of wonderful treats & such.  I would love to try their lunch bagel sandwiches!"
2,"I hate being the person that brings bad news to a business.  But I would rather Yelp about it and people know rather than it goes unnoticed.  More on that later in the review. \n\nI booked this stay about two months prior to me showing up on New Year's Eve.  Check it went fairly smooth with a little bump.  I forgot one of my IDs in my car and could not be checked in until after I had that ID in hand.  After walking back to my car I returned and everything went smoothly afterwards.  Kudos to the front desk staff for allowing me to leave my bag there instead of having to drag it back to my car and back to the hotel.\n\nThe room itself gave the impression that it was huge.  As several people have already stated, the ceiling were very high.  I was lucky enough to have a front facing room that looked out over Penn Ave.  I kind of loved this as I could watch the New Year's Eve parade from my room and save myself from the freezing temps outside.  However, you could tell that this was an older building as the floors creaked as I walked around the room.  I could also hear the person above as they walked about.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean.  I am not sure how this happened, but I got a handicap room.  So I am assuming that this is why everything felt so spacious in here as well.  Everything about the room screamed modern, from the paint colors to the carpeting.  \n\nNow, to get back to what I was referring to at the beginning; the bad news.  Upon arriving at the hotel and after checking in I decided I needed to take a nap in preparations for the night's festivities.  It was a fairly short nap, roughly about an hour.  When I woke up after my nap and turned on the light, I noticed something crawling across the sheets.  *starts itching*  Yes people, it was what you are thinking, a bedbug.  BEDBUG!  I immediately grabbed a tissue to dispose of the hideous little monster (I know, it did me no good by doing that, it was more of a reflexive response than anything).  I have made contact with Courtyard about this, but have yet to hear back from them on how they are going to rectify the problem.  I felt dirty afterward and moved all of my belongings into the bathroom, on the counter for the remainder of my stay.  I also slept in the other bed (I know, that may have been futile) and with the lights on for the rest of my stay.\n\nOther than that snag, I really have no complaints about this place.  Everything and everyone was pleasant.\n\n*Things to note: there is room service available, valet service, or if you prefer, park in one of the city garages and walk to the hotel, business center, fitness center, ATM and Starbucks available around the clock at the front desk."
3,"The TURKEY RACHEL should be the first thing you try... and you may like it so much it may be the last.  I can't vouch for everything on the menu, but I don't have to.  I grab the same two items every time I go in.  Fresh deli sliced turkey, with just a bit of thousand island (not drenched in it), and a fresh rye bread.  The only thing here that rivals it is the TOMATO BASIL TORTELLINI SOUP.  Paired with a double cheese grilled cheese and you got a winner.  Problem is they only do that soup once a month.  I 've had a few other items on the menu, all pretty good.  Just a solid place to eat lunch."
3,I have seen a lot of shows here.  It's really nice and brings some amazing productions to the city.  \n\n(and I also saw the Great Gatsby ballet that another commenter mentioned!)
2,"Alright, I live within waking distance, so that factors into me and my family eating here pretty often. We're new to the 'Burgh, so we didn't know about the chain before we moved here. The food is always good. We've explored the menu and have never been unsatisfied. Big plus: the sundae bar!!!! It's worth the trip in and of itself. \n\nThe only downer about this location are the hours. They close at 8:00 or something. And only open on Sunday if there's a Steeler/Pirate game in town that day. I can't tell you how many people I've seen try and dine here when they're closed. Also, they're always understaffed. It's turned into somewhat of a running joke with us: the staff expect to be slow but they get slammed every night we're there! So the servers end up with 10 tables or so. And there's never a hostess to seat guests, so people just end up wandering in and seating anywhere. This adds to the chaos. It's almost painful to watch. But the staff is very friendly, for the most part. Only once have I been upset at service and it was with a to-go order. The bartender took my order and didn't write anything down. I knew it was a bad sign but didn't say anything. Sure enough, the whole order was f'd up. We called and complained and they comped us a meal. So all was well. \n\nBottom line, great place to eat, even though it seems its glory days are behind it. But a little patience and a sundae bar go a long way here."
0,"This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business."
1,"Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses? My advice to you son, is do the same as your father, and his father did...get a job!!!"
2,"I'm giving it three-stars, but it honestly started as a one-star experience.  The appearance and feel of the place is that of a diner/Irish-dive-bar hybrid.  It isn't dirty but it is a bit dark.  It isn't all-american diner, but there's a diner-esque  feel to the floor-plan.  But it is Irish, and that's super fun.\n\nMel U. wrote that the first impression was that of \""MAKEOVER TIME!\"" and I agree.  But I wouldn't change their motif or the theme ... I just would update a little.  And perhaps send some of the staff to polishing classes.\n\nOur bartender had no issue making it clear she was tired, didn't really want to be there, and felt somewhat inconvenience by the fact that people showed up right at 430pm.  About 30 minutes later tho ... we were all laughing together and having a grande ole time!!  So I'll file that into \""crappy first impression\"" archive and give her the benefit of the doubt. (I used to work retail, so I know sometimes customers is that last thing we want to see.)\n\nNow on to the booze and drinks!  Our drinks were STRONG.  Linda W. asked for a Dark&Stormy which caused the initial inconvenience wave since ginger beer was in the kitchen coolers.  I went with a basic Diet & Vanilla vodka.  Drinks were strong and good.  The D&S could have used some extra lime but it was heavy enough that it was good in its own right.\n\nThe food was good.  My burger was cooked to order and the sweet potato fries were scrumptious.  Linda W. was able to get a basket of fries which were a great value!\n\nThere are a couple drink-and-chill all the time type customers there so the conversation was rather interesting once Serena R. arrived dressed as Carmen SanDiego.  We left with smirk and a bit of an eye roll at what was certainly a unique experience in one of Liberty Avenue's eating establishments."
1,"We went on a random Thursday night for dinner.  Our expectations were thinking this local establishment might be a great local pub with sub par food.  This is what we found. \n\nOur server was friendly enough and welcoming, but dining room area is out dated decor.  Food was not awful, but just barely average.  I had a salad and my husband had a fish sandwich.  They arrived quickly, were reasonably priced and by friendly staff, but the food was nothing special.  Nothing unique or notable about either one. \n\nThe bar area up front seems like a small, local friendly place to go after work, but I would skip the food."
3,"Good Coffee and Travel Advice!  What more can you ask?\n\nA buddy and I decided to explore the strip district one Saturday and found this gem of a coffee shop.    We ordered a couple a Cappuccino's.    The employees were very nice and provided some good insight on what to see and visit.\n\nThe Caps were good, the vibe was great and it is in the heart of the Strip District.   A strong recommend."
3,this is a great place for those who enjoy looking at art and an alright place for a student like me to learn about art as a requirement for class. \n\nThis gallery was by far... the most attention grabbing because of its electric show... although I didn't understand the concept of it all... I really enjoyed my time there... I got some great photos from the trip... so it was a worth that much :)
2,"Not four-star cuisine, but good Take Out.   As you can tell I am a regular lunch goer on Penn Avenue. The take out food at Fu Lai is always dependable and the price is reasonable.  Because I prefer my food to be a little on the plain side, I always get the chicken with pea pods or the chicken with vegetables.  Very satisfying!"
3,"This place is great. We purchased the smoked prosciutto, hard salami, and peperoni when we stopped in. The counter staff was very friendly, despite being VERY busy, and made some excellent recommendations. \n\nNext time I'm going to add a selection of cheeses to my purchase of cured meat."
2,"No fax machine. No electronic records. No emails or computers.  I have to keep track of my pet's vaccination records?  What's up with that? The doctors are very nice and seem competent.  Front desk support is generally ok, but had a phone conversation with someone who must have gotten up on the wrong side of the bed...  Options are limited for those of us who live downtown."
3,"Holy smokes crazy tea place you are crazy. it would have been a 5, but i got 'guilted' out of getting coffee when i was told I was ordering the last cup (after i relented, someone else just ordered after me). granted, it was Christmas Eve and people the employees wanted to go home.\n\nThe excitement about this place is evident from my mom's enthusiasm about the place as a tea expert. In the tea arena, i have seen no equal. The mustached tea guru who works there literally puts together the different teas - and has an intimate knowledge of each."
3,"Was visiting Pittsburgh a few weeks ago and happened upon Lidia's mostly by accident.\n\nA happy accident, for sure.\n\nLidia's has a nice selection of various pastas but their main attraction appears to be the Pasta Trio, where each day three different types of pastas are selected, each type having a waiter/waitress assigned to walking around and making sure you've got as much of it as you like, sort of the same thing gauchos do in Brazilian steakhouses.\n\nMy friends got the Trio and were quite happy with it.  I went safe with the lasagna, which was perfectly cheesy and saucy.\n\nDessert had a name I can't remember, but it was a kind of chocolate/caramel ice cream with a toasted marshmellow coating around it and little bits of toffee.  I shouldn't have eaten it all but my arm and my mouth conspired against me.  Jerks.\n\nA nice ambiance and friendly waitstaff certainly don't hurt.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I think I'll be seeing Lidia again, and I don't care who knows!"
4,"What a great dinner!  I had the pasta trio special.  They walk around with three pastas and just re-fill your plate.  I even wanted one of them without an ingredient,and they didn't bat an eye.  They even had the pasta prepared the same way to refill me!  I haven't been back, and I kick myself for it on my way out of town every time I visit there!"
2,"For those stuck in the convention center area, this is a ok place for a beer and pub food.\n\nAs a graduate student in the area only to attend a conference, I have been to this bar twice.\n\nThe jalapeno poppers and onion rings are a favorite. The buffalo wings are ok...nothing special.\n\nGets very crowded during games, but makes the place fun.\n\nSo, if you are trapped around the area with no car and crave a beer and munchies, this place is A-Ok."
1,"Pretty okay pizza.  Standard so-so Pittsburgh pizza.  However , the fact that the delivery driver expected me to run from my second floor apartment out to the middle of the street to get it was not okay.  He was rude when I asked him to come up, talking about how he has other deliveries to make and he couldn't park (meanwhile, there were multiple open parking spaces directly in front of the apartment; as well as an entire parking lot right next door). \n\nAfter arguing with me for a few minutes, he finally decided to park and come up. I really don't want to have to argue with someone to get them to do their job when I order delivery. And I certainly don't want to have to leave my house, to go out in the cold, for what is supposed to be delivery.   Is it so strange to expect food delivery to make it to my actual doorstep?  This seems to be a recent trend, pizza delivery people expecting the customer to run out into the street to get their pizza.  It stopped me from ordering from another place, and it will stop me from ordering from Ephesus again."
4,"This is the best place (IMO) that delivers to Troy Hill.  Please allow an hour at least for delivery.  It is worth it.\n\nIn the past I've had the regular pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, etc) from there.  Always delicious.  Today I decided to try some of their other selections:\n\nMoroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum Pizza (SOO GOOD)\nPide with Pastirma (WONDERFUL)\nBeets (I had a craving.  Really really good!)\n\nDelivery was only 5 minutes past the GrubHub estimate.  Driver polite and friendly as has always been my experience with them.\n\nI'm usually stingy with the stars, but as it is so hard to find good food delivered to Troy Hill (not counting using Meals Delivered), I'm going for it.  Five stars!"
3,"Very nice hotel. First time staying here. Stayed for three nights. Room was on the 9th floor.\n\nHotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was huge! I could have fit 40 or so people in my room if I had to.\n\nCons:\n- Older CRT-based, analog style TVs in the room. C'mon! Where is the large flat panel HD screens with HD programming?\n- TV service is satellite based. Lots of interference and loss of signal during my stay due to thunderstorms. Need Verizon FIOS here.\n- In order to unlock the door to the room - you have to grasp the door handle and pull the door toward you while the card for the door lock is inserted and wait for the light on the lock to turn green\n- Room was very stuffy when I arrived. It took about 6 hours for the room to cool off. Once it cooled off though - it was fine.\n\nPros\n- Beds were comfy - still not as firm as I would prefer - but better than some of the places I've stayed recently.\n- Pillows were substantial. I hate it when you get pillows that flatten out to the thinness of a pizza box the moment your head hits the pillow.\n- Hotel staff are friendly and looking to make your stay as nice as possible\n- The two dragons guarding the entrance to the hotel - very cool looking!\n- Club Lounge is nice touch - got some appetizers to eat and a few cold beverages to take back to my room and store in the fridge for later.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- If you are staying here - please note the hotel does not have a convenience store - they have a very limited number of items for sale down by the front desk. If you are in need of toiletries, beverages, snacks and other items - there is a 7-Eleven down the street - and a CVS and a Rite Aid an additional block or so further - BUT - be forewarned - none of these three options stays open very late. \n\n7-Eleven (601 Penn Avenue)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/7-eleven-pittsburgh-4\n\nRite Aid (519 Penn Avenue)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/rite-aid-pittsburgh-17\n\nIf it's after 10:00 pm - all of these places will be closed. You will have to walk a bit farther to find the next 7-Eleven and a Clarks that stays open later - but your choices/selections will be severely limited product-wise.\n\n7-Eleven (643 Liberty Avenue)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/7-eleven-pittsburgh-5\n\n- There are lots of restaurants on 6th near the hotel. While I have not tried them all - the ones I enjoyed the most were: Six Penn, Indian Spices, and The Bridge (actually in the hotel).\n\nSix Penn\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/six-penn-kitchen-pittsburgh\n\nIndian Spices\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/indian-spices-pittsburgh\n\nThe Bridge\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bridge-bar-pittsburgh\n\n- There is a Starbucks just down the street too for those that need to get their caffeine buzz on!\n\nStarbucks\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-coffee-pittsburgh-4"
3,"We stayed here after getting an awesome deal on Priceline for $90 per night. I admit that if I'd paid full price I'd have been a little annoyed at the size of the room. It felt pretty small, but it was comfortable and had a great view of Heinz Field. It's also a fantastic location. We were able to walk almost everywhere, which I always enjoy when spending time in a new city. \n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful, especially in the lobby. It's a historic hotel and really managed to keep the aesthetics of the original interior but update them in appropriate ways. \n\nI would recommend avoiding the restaurant if you can. As with all hotel restaurants it was overpriced, and the breakfast we ate there was unmemorable to say the least."
2,"Last time I stayed here was three years ago - stayed for three nights. This time was for one overnight only.\n\nThe AC in my room was not working well. It was enough to cool off the room - but it still felt a tad on the humid side. Again, another really old hotel with an inefficient, antiquated central AC system. Given the nature of this building, I doubt they could ever retrofit the building with the necessary HVAC infrastructure to improve it. I could be wrong.\n\nOne plus over the last time I stayed here is that the old analog style, CRT-based TVs are now gone - at the least in the room I stayed in had a newer flat panel HD TV set.\n\nAs before in my previous review:\n\n- If you are staying here - please note the hotel does not have a convenience store - they have a very limited number of items for sale down by the front desk. If you are in need of toiletries, beverages, snacks and other items - there is a 7-Eleven down the street - and a CVS and a Rite Aid an additional block or so further - BUT - be forewarned - none of these three options stays open very late.  We attempted to visit both the above 7-11 and CVS - but it was after 10:00 pm and three years later they ar still keeping the same limited hours.\n\nAnd you can't get any food at the Braddock Bar in the Hotel lobby after 10:00 pm or so. Very annoying."
1,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal."
1,Pre-fab fried food. Decor has character. The beer is cheap.
1,Awesome chowder but that's it...
2,"Not what I expected!  This place is a Pittsburgh institution.  I expected mahogany and brass, but walked into a tiny diner.\n\nVery friendly.  The fish is awesome.  The huge Calimari rings are absurdly tender.  No gumminess at all.  \n\nThe place is crazy at lunch time, so I never even attempted it until now.  Worked late and still a decent crowd."
3,"This restaurant is great for anyone in the mood for seafood. The clam chowder is as creamy and flavorful as everyone says it is. The fish and shrimp are very fresh, though the crab cake was nothing special. The place is a historic landmark, and the decor suits the laid-back atmosphere. The service is pretty friendly, too. Overall, I didn't find the experience as bad as others have in the past, and the restaurant is worth checking out."
0,"This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza, and my friend got an Italian hoagie. \n\nOne slice of this pizza, and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay, but the pizza...oh, the horror of the pizza. \n\nAvoid."
0,"Unfortunately this dump is right down the street from my hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever."
1,"Update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best.  So disappointing, we loved it the first time!  My guess is that if you get pizza right out of the oven you're good to go - otherwise, you're SOL."
3,"I really really really love Harp & Fiddle.  Though I live in Denver now, I spent a fair amount of time in Pittsburgh and my office is right down the street.  Even if it weren't, I'd still spend time here.\n\nLast week, while in Pittsburgh I ate lunch here two of the three days I was in town.  Seems that each time I visit, they've made some changes to their menu and their food is always consistently good.  On this visit, I had the salmon chopped salad one day and the chicken cordon bleu sandwich the other.  The salad was perfect for lunch - exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced as well.  A lot of times it's empty in here at lunch time (sometimes it's not) and I don't get it.  The lunch options toward the east end of the strip aren't many, so I'm surprised more people haven't caught on to lunch at the Harp.  Oh well, their loss is my gain.  \n\nIn addition to being a regular lunch spot, this is also usually my choice for drinks after work as well.  My brother and I have spend many long nights at the bar and it's usually the first choice for work happy hours too.  Sad to say, that I used to spend SO much time here when I lived in PGH that when I walk in now, they remember my drink.  OOPS!  We've been here for Irish Dancing night, open mic night and karaoke night - they're all pretty amusing.  They also have a nice little pato out back for when the weather is warmer.\n\nWhether they're busy or slow, the service is always spot on.  I really wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood in Denver."
2,"I would say that Lemongrass is ok, not great.\n\nI've had the Panang curry a few times and really enjoyed it. The Green curry is also decent.\n\nWhat brings Lemongrass down is incredibly slow service. Whether it's during a busy time or a slow time, it's slow slow slow. One waiter for the entire restaurant and that's it.\n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant are nice. And given the price, it's not a bad lunch spot."
2,"For years, when going to the theater, my friend and I have eaten across the street at Indian Spices, or occasionally next door at Christo's, looking out one window and into the window of Lemon Grass.  They never looked especially busy (but then during theater times, I've rarely been anywhere downtown that really WAS 'especially busy') and we really didn't know anything about it.  So on this particular foray into a night with Lily Tomlin, we thought we'd try something different.\n\nI see all the growling reviews here complaining about...well...everything...from service to food, and frankly, I'm not quite sure we were all at the same restaurant.\n\nI'm also a bit confused by most people calling it 'Thai' when the menu says 'Cambodian'.\n\nLemon Grass was pleasant.  They did seem to operate with minimal staff, but they certainly seemed to keep up.  There was a small group of diners when we arrived, and that number grew while we were there, seemed like mostly people who were going to the same show we were.\n\nThe menu options were quite ethnic and unusual from things I'd seen on most Asian menus, which to me, was very cool. Couldn't pronounce them, but the ingredients were certainly unlike the others, so we decided to try a couple of dishes we'd never tried before, including an appetizer.\n\nThe appetizers were called 'Na Taings' and were like little non-sweet rice krispie treats that came with a very yummy pork and curry sauce to top them with.  There were five on the plate.  Several of their appetizers came 5 to the plate.  Ok folks, what is UP with the odd numbers on appetizer plates around here lately?  If you're sharing with another person, do we really want to incite a riot over who gets the last one?  Even Stevens is best on any shared plate.  Two for you, two for me, or three for you, three for me...not 'Oh no, you go ahead'  'No, YOU go ahead, really'.\n\nAnyway, the appetizer was quite tasty and hit the spot.\n\nMy friend ordered hot tea, which seemed to come in a magical pot.  The pot was only about two inches tall, and about as round as a very small tortilla, but it filled both of our normal sized cups three times.  It was a beautiful little creation of a pot, I must say. It looked like cast iron, and was very ornamental, and came with its own matching trivet to rest upon.  The tea was a very flavorful jasmine. How six cups managed to fit in that tiny pot is amazing.\n\nFor the entrees, I cannot remember the names of the dishes, nor can I find them listed online. Lemon Grass doesn't seem to have its own website, and all of the menu sites only appear to have a minimalist lunch menu, or something outdated.\n\nMy friend ordered something with many vowels and consonants, that was a seafood-curry-vegetable mix on a bed of 'crispy rice noodles', and I ordered another dish with many vowels and consonants, that was a pork based curry and vegetable (but lower on the veggie count) also over a bed of crispy rice noodles.\n\nAfter the waitress took our order, she came back from the kitchen to inform my friend that the dish she'd ordered was out, so my friend opted for the same as I.\n\nThe dishes arrived.  There was a giant mound of crispy white rice noodles, and they were indeed 'crispy', with a decent sized spot of the actual meat and curry portion nestled against it, with a ginormous decorative flower made of beet (my plate) and carrot (her plate) on a landscaping of parsley.  We switched plates...beets make me gag.  Then the waitress asked if we wanted chopsticks, and well...not so functional for a blind woman, but I opted to use them.\n\nThe dish was unusual and quite delicious - but a CHORE to eat, with either a fork OR chop sticks.  The first bite I tried to take with the chop sticks literally thrust the end of a very rigid rice noodle right up my right nostril.  In my friend's case, even with a fork, rice noodles were flying.  But, all in all, it was quite delicious. It was pork, a curry gravy, some bean sprouts, and fried egg strips.  Honestly, except for the grrrrrr of trying to contain the crispy rice noodles to the plate, it was a tasty and filling meal.  Quite pleasant, and it was nice to try something 'new' to us.\n\nThe bill wasn't outrageous, just under $40 for two entrees, an appetizer, and a pot of tea.\n\nWe both agreed that we'd go back...but next time we'll avoid the 'crispy' noodles for something a bit more malleable like rice or soft noodles.\n\nThe staff was fine and helpful - the food decent.  Heck the only thing that made the evening even slightly unpleasant was the cackling yinzer at one table who apparently thought she was in her own dining room at home.\n\nFor the pre-theater or concert scenario, I do recommend it.  It's worth a shot, especially if you're an 'outside the box' eater.  Try something you can't pronounce...what the heck."
2,"it's OK. I stopped by this bakery on the way to the bank, looking for something to satisfy my sweet tooth. Nothing really caught my eye or got my mouth watering. \n\nI ended up picking two chocolate patties with peanut butter filling ($4/both). I wasn't two impressed: the cake seemed a bit stale and the filling was not creamy.\n\nI do have to say some of the cakes didn't look half bad. But, it seemed like Paddy Cake is comparable to the bakery section of your typical grocery store which is disappointing since I'm always on the lookout for mouth watering sweets."
4,"Haven't been in a while (not really a bike nut, or even a regular rider) but I have to relate a story to tell you what kind of a place this is... I inherited a bike my dad had purchased in college, and hard a part break, I knew that Kraynick's would be the only place able to help, even though at the time there were still Schwinn \""authorized\"" dealers in the area. \n\nHere's the exchange: \n\nMe: \""I have an old Schwinn three-speed, probably from 1969 or '70, and it has this little washer with a raised part that fits in the groove between the fork and the rear axle. That part broke.\"" \n\nHim: \""A Collegiate or a Speedster?\"" \n\nMe (amazed): \""Speedster.\"" \n\nAt which point he turned around to a wall of tiny drawers that seemed to stretch from floor to ceiling and appeared to have no intelligible labeling, pull open a single drawer, and produce the part I needed. It cost something like 30 cents... \n\nPlaces like this pretty much do not exist anymore, the shop is like a museum of bicycle parts (and the upper stories of the building are reportedly just as full). If the recurring rumors of its closing / Mr. Kraynick's retirement are any indication, it may not be here forever. FIND ANY EXCUSE to get here while it's still around!"
4,"Some drunk asshole fell into my back tire and completely ruined it. Rather then go to Trek and spend a good $100 for a new tire and the labor I headed to Kraynicks.\n\nI spent around 3 hours fixing not just my back tire, but my shoes, shifters, and I even cleaned up my chain and gears. I love that you go in to fix a simple issue but end up spending hours there. You can't help it. Gerry and John are great people and their willing to help you because they just love what they do rather than to just make a profit. \n\nI already want to go back. And yes best bike shop in existence is a pretty accurate statement."
1,Last barber on the left was who helped me. Very nice but not very skilled. He uses plastic guards for his shears and also I noticed after washing my hair I have very thin parts that were cut much shorter than the rest of my hair. Luckily my hair grows fast. I trusted Yelp! reviews but they let me down. I may try one of the other barbers with real shears once more but I am hesitant to recommend or go back here with  confidence.
4,"You won't find a better haircut for the price in all of Pittsburgh. \n\nI spent my first year in Pittsburgh not knowing where to get a good haircut. I tried a bunch of different places, and often settled for an overpriced buzz at Supercuts. The day I found Dan Cercone was a life changer for me.\n\nIf you go on a Saturday, one of their moms bakes cookies and has other random complimentary snacks. Following my last visit, I walked out of there looking sharp, munching on a vanilla Powerbar. (Only a couple munches, that thing was gross)"
0,"I would write a \""0\"" review if I could. I cannot review the food. I did not get a chance to eat there. Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food, during one of the \""Unblurred\"" Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully, and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No \""reserved\"" signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up. \n\nWhether or not he was prick or or a racist prick, I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield, so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble, who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat, we do not? \n\nWith the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers, I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating."
4,I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town.
3,"Just got back from trying the lunch buffet at Taste of India, which was pretty good and a definite value.  It is $7.95/person and includes a drink - soda, mango juice or mango lassi.  The buffet has the usual chutneys and raitas, naan, vegetable pakoras, fresh fruit (mostly watermelon), salad, chicken fried rice and plain basmati rice, 3 chicken dishes and 3 veggie dishes.  Today there was tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and a plain old chicken curry, channa masala, alu palak, and alu green beans.  There were also gulab jamuns.\n\nMy favorite was definitely the alu green beans, which disappointingly is not on the menu.  The chickpeas were good, but I thought the alu palak was disappointing.  (I am generally disappointed in palak paneer at restaurants since I have an awesome recipe that I make at home all the time.)  The watermelon chunks were an awesome palate cleanser, and the gulab jamuns were great.  Total for two people came to $17 before tip.\n\nThis is a nice little place, and at lunch almost everyone there is Children's Hospital staff.  Parking is a little hard to find since the residential streets are permit only.  But I really like this place and it's definitely worth it."
0,"5:30pm, worst Baingan Bartha I've ever had. Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \""8\"" really pop with flavor."
3,"This place is awesome.  He was closed but was still there cleaning and took me in for a great old school cut.  I'd tried some salons and was relying on Sueprcuts a lot and hadn't been to a barber in quite some time.  Sure, I haven't had this kind of haircut since gradeschool, but he did clean it up quite nicely and even gave my beard a clean trim.  Definitely recommended if this is what you're looking for.  Also, some great conversation"
1,"D'Amico's is like...Olive Garden, only less festive and with more \""local color.\""  We came here for a coworker holiday dinner at 530 pm on a Thursday.  We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It's very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\n\nOur server was definitely \""set in her ways,\"" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \""does not compute\"" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \""...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\"" and I was all \""yes, I just got here....I don't even know what I want!\"" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \""oh, do you need a list or something?\""  I know, I'm one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I'm weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I'd recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money's worth.\n\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn't anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn't bother with the bread - it didn't look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\n\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn't think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn't help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn't a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people's dishes and my response was the same.  It's just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \""meh\"" the food was, I think it's way overpriced.\n\nSo I wouldn't go back.  It's not my kind of food, or place.  For all the Italian folks around here, I'm sure Pittsburgh must have way better Italian food offerings than this."
3,"I do have a special place in my stomach for Tram's kitchen and I try to eat there every now and again.  Pho is a good meal to warm you up in the winter and this place is a great place to stop in for a yummy dinner.  I have been a little wary to go off the beaten path of the spring rolls and the Pho, so I got the spring rolls and the chicken peanut soup (I think that is what it was called).  It was very close to the chicken Pho, except it had less noodles, more veggies, and a little different twist on the sauce with some crunched peanuts that settled at the bottom and a bit more spice.  The dishes definitely didn't disappoint.  The parking is on the street (which is usually pretty empty after working hours), and the ambiance seems to have perked up a little bit with what I think is a new coat of baby blue paint and some new flowery table cloths.  Don't worry though, the mother of pearl wall art is still there, and your chances of not understanding your server is still high.  The prices are cheap, the grub is good, and the place is uh... rustic, oh yeah, and bring cash!"
2,"Pho is good but its not best pho or egg rolls (they don't even serve it with the lettuce and herbs) you can get in Pittsburgh. On the flip side though, their owner is super friendly"
4,"This place has been reviewed a lot, obviously, so I'll keep it short and sweet with a list.\n\nPros:\nThe vegetarian Pho is amazing. I will only have eyes for it when I go there, and maybe a fresh veggie spring roll. Unlike two of the other reviewers who had some sour grapes over their experience, I have multiple resources that the veggie Pho broth is vegan.\nCheap. Huge bowl of Pho with fresh veggies and a drink for under $10. \n\nCons:\nParking in this neighborhood is a racket and restaurant doesn't have a lot.\n\nGood to know:\nNo credit. Take cash, or use the ATM in the vestibule.\nAtmosphere is hole-in-the-wall. If you can't cope with that, get takeout or don't go."
3,"I am from Houston, since I came here I've been searching for the perfect bowl of pho. I have to say this is the closest thing yet from home!!! Good pho with fair pricing, doesn't get ebtter than this."
0,"Don't believe the hype.\n\nWas in the Pittsburgh area for one day and decided to try the pho here.  It was a toss up between Pho Minh and here.  I think I chose wrong.\n\nA rule of thumb is a good ethnic restaurant will be swarming with that particular ethnic people.  When I went, all I saw were non-Asians.  \n\nOrdered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable. It did not taste flavorful and authentic but maybe that's what is available in Pittsburgh.\n\nAnother sour note, they dropped off some spring rolls at our table.  It was our first time there and I thought they were complimentary so we ate them.\n\nLater on, we saw them on our bill.  WE DIDN'T EVEN ORDER THEM.\n\nThey were overpriced, and not worth it.\n\nBe careful if they drop off food or drinks at your table, they will bill you for it afterwards even if you didn't order it."
3,"I came here once and ordered pho, and I was very disappointed. Bland broth, tough meat, I didn't get the Tram's hype. Not that I've ever tried mind-blowing pho (I've only eaten it in Pennsylvania, which is probably the problem) but this was even worse than most.\n\nHowever, I've since been back and ordered the bun. Now I was impressed! Specifically with the version doused in coconut milk--I love coconut anything, and on top of vermicelli noodles with a squirt of hoisin and sriracha, it was heaven. Only thing is, I don't like the selection of vegetables they use. Onions and broccoli just aren't my jam, and my favorite veggie to have with my bun, cucumber, was sadly MIA from Tram's version.\n\nI do consider myself to be a little bit of a fresh spring roll connoisseur (ooookay, maybe not, but I eat them a lot), and Tram's are good, but not my favorite in the city. I know, a lot of people are all about Tram's rolls, but I like mine with lots of Thai basil, and you can barely taste it in theirs. They're still super fresh with a good amount of meat, so this is just a matter of preferences, not quality.\n\nRegardless of the meh pho, I can't stress enough that it's totally worth it to come here for the coconut milk bun! Delicious!!"
1,"I came here awhile ago and ordered one of the rice-based dishes with chicken (can't remember exactly what it was, and there's no menu posted online for me to figure it out).  The dish was dry and lacked flavor.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish here, since the Pho seems to be what they're known for.  As it were, I wasn't impressed. I don't remember anything being off about the service, so it must have been fine.  If a dining partner specifically wanted to try Vietnamese, I'd come back and try the Pho, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, given that there are many better dining options on Butler St."
1,The food isn't something to rave about but it's edible. I love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves. I have only been to (C)Ritters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when Pittsburgh's finest come out to play. Never a dull moment.
2,"Sometimes at four in the morning you need a place to eat, and, for that purpose, Ritters does its job. Otherwise the food is pretty mediocre. Remember if you can after a long night out that this establishment is cash only. \n\nYou are never going to get great service here, and for the most part at night when the entire place is packed full of belligerent drunks why should you? The waitstaff does their job: takes orders, brings out the food, and refills your drinks, but don't expect much more and surely don't expect to have all your requests pampered. I feel bad for the waitstaff who have to deal with drunks all night, especially on the weekend.\n\nThis is a Pittsburgh landmark, nice diner vibe, and a place where I will always have great memories. Though the food is pretty mediocre and slightly overpriced for the quality I will always keep coming back here out of nostalgia."
1,"2.5 but I rounded down.\nThis is not a place you go to eat out but it's rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps 4 in the morning. Cash only. Doesn't separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves.\nI'm not a big fan of diner's and haven't been to one so I don't have anything to compare to but like I said, if you have nowhere else to go you might try this one.\nFood is ok. It's like the food that a mom who doesn't care for cooking cooked. I don't want to be too mean. Waitresses are friendly. They are dressed up in scrubs like nurses."
2,"Ritters is a Pittsburgh treasure. Old school diner, complete with at-table mini jukeboxes that sometimes work. Great people watching here.  This is the place you come for late night munchies or possibly morning after recovery.  Breakfast food is on point, as is the Greek fare. Cash only like most of the coolest spots in The Burgh!"
3,"I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit, I was wrong... Until tonight.  I have found that every Italian restaurant I've tried has left much to be desired; from Del's atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar, I had not found an Italian joint I liked.\n\nLombardozzi, I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight.  I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them, but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal.\n\nWe started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection, and no rubbery feel, which is a positive, because 99% of places outside the east coast can't to calamari to save their lives.\n\nI had the gnocchi with red sauce (only sauce option which kind of irks me, because gnocchi is great with a pesto) with meatballs.  The gnocchi is homemade and to die for, and the sauce is pretty good too (I'm a sauce snob, nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers) and the meatballs were as good as I remembered.\n\nGreat food experience, but the service was at best bad.  The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order, and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing.\n\nI will be back, because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi."
2,"Kudos to Tessaro's for cooking my burger the way I ordered it.  Most places won't give you a \""medium\"" burger; it usually leans toward medium well, at best.  Tessaro's took a liberal approach to medium and it fared more toward medium-rare to my surprise and delight.  So for that, hooray!  And it definitely was the plumpest, juiciest burger I've had in a looonnngg time.  \nThat said, I really wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be.  I thought I liked my burgers pure and untainted, but here I found myself wanting a little more flavor.  I guess it just tasted a little bland.  The homefries, also a little bland.  \nI don't know...maybe my expectations were too high.  Despite being underwhelmed by the food (by no means dissapointed), I loved the atmosphere.  It was cozy and bustling and unpretentious, and the service was spot-on.  Once seated, we didn't have to wait for a thing.  Our orders were taken immediately, our drinks arrived at our table within a minute of ordering, and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  \nGood to know: They won't seat you unless your entire party is there.  In this case, it was just my husband I was waiting on.  That was a little annoying...but understandable considering how busy they are.\n\nDefinitely a solid burger worth the praise and the totally reasonable price!  I probably won't go out of my way to go back, but I'd definitely take an out-of-town visitor for a meal there and it's a definite stop if I'm in or near the neighborhood."
2,"I wouldn't say it's the best burger I've had, but still very good.  I had a cheeseburger with mushrooms and bacon.  The bun was unfortunately too small for the patty and the top portion of the bun was rock hard.  The burger was extremely large and cooked very well.  The wait staff was very friendly and the food was out immediately."
1,"In theory, Tessaro's is exactly what you want -- a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product. In practice, it's not very pleasant to go there. I don't think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\n\nThe burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they get sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You have to finish it with a fork.  \n\nThey don't serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre, given that everything else about the place screams \""we have fries here!\"" Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years? This hints at either a weird purist dogmatic sensibility, or deliberate sabotage.  Why not serve fries *and* homefries?  Are they afraid the fries will win, exposing the hollow sham that the homefries have been all along?\n\nI've come to believe that everyone at Tessaro's is under a spell where they must cook and serve excellent hamburgers, but they hate cooking and serving hamburgers. Everything about the restaurant that is not an actual meat patty is cleverly designed to keep you away. But you  keep going back. \n\nHave some pity for the poor cursed Tessaro workers, and just go up the street to BRGR, or downtown to Winghart's."
4,"Had the best burger of my life at Tessaro's over the weekend. I ordered the Guacamole Burger (on the specials menu) and was not disappointed. The burger was large and packed with flavor. The guacamole was tasty and creamy and topped my burger off perfectly. I liked that they had so many options for sides with their meals. I opted for the cole-slaw and it was very good as well.\n\nOur waitress was extremely personable and our food came quick.\n\nI don't give a lot of 5-star ratings but this place deserves one.  My burger was cooked to perfection. Great quality food, service and good atmosphere!"
2,"All the locals recommended this place to me for burgers and I've tried them twice to just make sure the first time wasn't a goof. But both times, the food was so blah. It should take more then just a massive piece of meat to get good ratings. I've tried both a burger and a steak, and they were both so bland. There's no flavor what's so ever. I was highly disappointed."
2,"When I lived in Bloomfield, Pleasure Bar was one of my staples.  They have a decent size bar, and two dining areas.  I've sat in all, and have had excellent service.  Honestly, I don't' recall ever being displeased with service here.  It's very Pittsburgh, so if you sit at the bar you can definitely catch a game.  The dining areas can accommodate groups, and I've seen many a family in here.  When they're busy it can get noisy, but not excessive. \nI have sampled just about everything on their menu.  A few of my faves:  Italian Eggrolls...mmmmm...i'm hungry just thinking about them.  Stuffed mushrooms are pretty bomb as well, and the Bruschetta Bread.  When it comes to entrees you can't go wrong with the pick your own pasta. Their sauces are homemade and oh so good.  My go-to is the pesto with angel hair.\n \nIf you're looking for a nice place, with good homemade food, this is it.\n\nBonus: During little Italy days they have a stand out front.  Do it."
0,"Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost $9.00. (My fault, I should have asked, I guess.) Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners."
1,"I've been here many times and I'll continue to come back.\n\nThe good:  the drink specials are good.  the food is good.  the location is good.  the crowd it draws is good.\n\nThe bad:  Dont come here if you are really hungry or in dire need of a drink bc the service has been CONSISTENTLY AWFUL.  Tonight, we sat outside and our waitress (Nikki) walked past us four times without making eye contact.  In fairness, I dont think it's an issue with the waitress being bad as much as they really need to hire more waitresses, bc it seemed like there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.\n\nOur tabletop was sticky and so after waiting for 20 min for service I decided I really needed a drink and went inside.  The bartender (Olivia) did not want to serve me bc we were sitting outside.  \""Your waitress will be right with you.\""  me:  \""But you are here now, can I please have a Shocktop Wheat?\""  \""Ill tell the waitress.\""  me:  \""Please may i just have my beer?\""  She served me, but then the waitress walked up to me and was like, \""Oh, I didn't see you, weren't you outside?\""  If you didn't see me how would you notice I was outside?\n\nIts ok, I felt bad for her bc she was so busy but like--I'm easy to please.  All I needed was a beer.  I got one, so the waitress and I were then \""cool.\""  She then proceeded to never come back to our table, but that's ok i think we pissed her off.\n\nThis has been a common thread:  not enough waitstaff so you have to beg for your food or drinks when the wait staff does come by.  It's extremely frustrating.\n\nThe time before last we were there we ordered food and the waitress told us that we could expect to wait over an hour bc they had a group of 15 come in.  We thought she was kidding, and had our beers, so we rolled with it but she was not kidding.  We waitied over an hour for our food and the waitress made no apologies.  Also, our friend came and ordered food before ours came out, and this was around 10:30.  after waiting and waiting and waiting we asked the waitress for an ETA on his burger, but it turned out she forgot to put it in, and hte kitchen had closed.\n\nThe service sucks but what really sucks is the staff is never apologetic about it bc this place is a neighborhood bar w locals so they kind of dont care about apologizing bc they know you'll be back.\n\nBut I come here bc like I said the food is ok, but you've got to come here and be very very patient."

0,"I came here for a filling after not having time to get it completed by my hometown dentist over Christmas break in early 2011. Not only was the filling $120 (no insurance), payment was demanded immediately upon exit, I also felt very disrespected by the office as a whole. The front staff is very curt and short. The gentleman who did my drilling had a patronizing and smart alleck attitude. When asking questions about the procedure he was doing, he mockingly imitated my voice (I am sorry I am not the most clear and articulate when I have a rod down my mouth getting a filling) to ask me what I said. He was very patronizing the whole time and unsympathetic to my legitimate worries I had seeing as this was the first time I went to a dentist other than the one I went to my entire life since childhood. I would never go back under any circumstance.\n\nEDIT: In my original review I stated this procedure was $250. The correct amount was actually $120. My apologies."
1,I was visiting for the weekend and we were looking for somewhere to go watch the LSU versus Alabama game and we chose Lot 17. When we arrived we were able to find seats at the bar since there was barely anyone there. They have a nice selection of draft beers. The food was definitely above average for a bar. The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by. If you are looking to watch a big game outside of Pennsylvania sports you may want to choose elsewhere or be relegated to the corner without sound.
0,"i was very excited to try this place.  thai is one of my favorite cuisines ever!!!  but i was sorrily disappointed. we started with spring rolls, through the rice wrapper i could see that the lettuce was browning, a sure sign that the rolls were not made to order.  the pad thai was dry and tasteless.  my friends curry and potatoes tasted like water with a touch of curry powder.  i hate giving poor reviews but nothing that i ate at thai cuisine was yummy."
4,"Friendly Service. Fresh Veggies! At only 1 dollar a person for BYOB and no corkage this place is a steal! The price is right too! \n\nIf you are a veggie, curry, wine lover who loves family style friendly service, then this place is for you!"
4,"I only come to Pittsburgh twice a year, but I get so excited to eat the best pizza. Sacramento pizzarias have nothing on Pittsburgh's. Fiori's is the best pizza I've ever eaten. It's local so my dad grew up eating the stuff & so did I until I moved to California. Sweet sauce and thin crust baked to perfection. If you're in Pittsburgh, you must try it. If you live in Pittsburgh, then you already know what I'm talking about."
2,"Service is just okay--they are rude short with you. No parking. On a brick road that will have your car shaking the whole time. You will get your car swiped if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is good. The sauce is sweet: not slightly sweet, but sweet. There is a lot of appeal to Fioris because of the sauce. I guess I prefer something savory in my sauce and find the aggravation to make it less worthwhile than Mineo's in Mt. Lebanon"
4,Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.
2,Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. \nIt wasn't horrible.
4,My girlfriend is much newer to the area so I try to take her to real Pittsburgh places. Fiori's should be held right up there next to Primanti's as a staple. South Hills icon. \n\nThere's old world charm when you order. Pie comes out quick. It's awesome deliciousness scored me many points with the lady and satisfied my soul for making my not-often-enough trip to this fantastic pizza icon of the City of Champs. \n\nPreach.
4,The sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car I always wanted for a price I could afford.  Talk to Jeff and Dom they are Awesome!
2,"Organization people, that's all I got to say, organization.  This place is in dire need of it.  Or maybe a map of some sort, but not like a treasure map.  I walked in to try and find a picture frame to use for a project and it took me forever to figure out that they were buried behind the knickknack area.\n\nAlso, the staff might want to take a people skills course.  Not a good experience to have them weaving in and out of customers much like a stunt car driver to avoid a question.  I really loved overhearing their conversations...\n\nOne other thing, make sure you work out a bit, that ramp connecting the levels is not fun to conquer when you're not expecting it."
1,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size.\n\nAlso, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one."
4,New pita caf\u00e9 is a welcome addition to a classic bakery and some of the best hummus in Pittsburgh. A great menu with fresh and local items served quickly efficiently and kicked up condiments and extras at every turn. This is the best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh bar none. Chef Greg keep it coming
3,"yummy, yummy chinese food.  thank heavens for there being one in brookline.  great food.  friendly, fast service.  decent prices.  funny kid who jumps out and tries to scare me every time i go is great in store entertainment.  very simple decore.\n\ni always walk here when i order since it so close and they always have it ready before i get there.  usually get the general tso's.  must try the other menu items someday."
3,"Nice atmosphere, good food - Sesame Inn gets an A in my book.  The service is good - I especially like the man who has been refilling water glasses since I was in middle school and always smiles at you.  There is a room off the main dining room to support larger groups, a full bar, and a great menu.  The lunch specials are very affordable, even to high school students, and can be packed on days when school lets out early.\n\nAs far as the food goes, everything is delicious.  The hot and sour soup is great, the ma po bean curd is the best I've ever had, and even their newest offering of pad thai is pretty good.  Whether you're taking out, eating in, or having food delivered, everything here is delicious."
0,"NEVER EVER get the All-you-can-Eat. Hibachi plates are basically plates of panfried squash with a little meat that isn't even grilled. They give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi. It's like they are trying to stuff us full of rice and squash so we fill up quickly. Also, service was unfriendly."
4,"This place has been on my list since I became a \""foodie\"" (quotes intended) ... and finally I was in town with the flexibility to go.\n\nIt's worth it ... I think it's on par with Pizzeria Bianco and Pupatellas as \""as good as it gets\"" for me ... and the great pastas and apps solidified the five star rating.\n\nVERY great."
0,"FILET MIGNON NOT AS ADVERTISED\n\nWe ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi.  The flavor was ok, we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done, was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet.  False advertising at its best--shouldn't that be illegal?\n\nThe fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles.  Other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice together.\n\nThe miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful.  The salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only (anyone ever heard of a salad spinner)--not very appetizing.\n\nWe also ordered sushi (all cooked ingredients) it was just ok and not the best I have experienced.\n\nThe waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea.  The whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost $75.00 tip included.  Not worth the price, time, gas and wear and tear on the car to get there."
2,"Not quite as good as the Squirrel Hill location, but quick service. Would recommend the Sicilian Pizza over the usual style."
1,"My experience at Anne Gregory was fine, but nothing spectacular. They were running behind for my appointment because the seamstress accidentally put a future bride getting alterations in \""my room.\"" No problem. It's not like we were offered water, coffee, champagne, anything though. I showed them photos and style names of several dresses I wanted to try on and they said they'd go pull them and have them ready when my room was ready. When I got into the room, I wanted to try on my \""favorite\"" dress, but they hadn't pulled it for me! When they finally did, I had to basically trip around and put it on myself while the bridal consultant watched me. She was certainly no help. And pinning? They don't \""clip\"" at Anne Gregory. So imagine my size 0 body in a size 10 or size 12 dress. It was impossible to figure out what I would look like, and my consultant didn't really seem to care (or know how to adjust the dress to even give me a general idea). Any dresses they pulled for me that weren't on my list were awful - not even close to the look I described. This was also the only shop I went to that prohibited pictures. Overall, a pretty lousy experience. I just can't figure out why this place is considered the premiere bridal salon in Pittsburgh. No thanks"
2,"Convenient and easier to find items then big box stores, although you do pay for that convenience. Most staff are extremely knowledgeable and helpful, others in dire need of customer service training (mocking and eye rolling at customers is not cool).  Returns can be a hassle including items sold that are defective or missing parts."
3,"This is a great local place for the neighborhood. There aren't many general shops or convenience stores within walking distance, so Rolliers is my go-to store. Their employees (beyond the local teens at the registers) are very friendly and knowledgeable. I've never had any problems finding plumbing, storage, or cleaning supplies."
1,"Not a huge fan of their coffee, the cookies and pastries are really good, however! The lemonade is amazing. The lady who works their, is super rude and never smiles. The customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers."
4,"This is a fantastic small hair salon. I have been going here for years and they are experts. You always feel valued and always have great service (and a GREAT cut too!).\nThe ambiance is superb- small, quaint, and not full of egos that you would normally find at a salon of this caliber.\n\nI highly recommend!!!"
1,"Internet Connection  = $60 \nWi-Fi router = $120 \nDaily internet pass = $4.95\n\nLosing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless.\n\n$4.95 for a day pass or $29.95 for a monthly pass is just ridiculous, especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of a/c plugs for laptop users.\n\nIf you are going to just have coffee then miss I's review is right on the spot, but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else."
3,Cute place with a delicious cap! Perfectly proportionate.
4,"Wash-dry-fold. Pick-up and delivery. Dress shirts. Dry cleaning. These people do so much, and charge such a reasonable amount. \n\nThey take credit cards, too, and they are easy to communicate with, if you have a change of plans or whatever.\n\nCan't say enough good things. I've been in the laundromat, too, though I haven't used it. It's nice and clean and pleasant, in that Pittsburgh's-take-on-hip kind of way."
0,"Ick.  Stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item.  I wanted to try on a $400 fur...and the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me.  He then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so.  He would not let me handle the coat myself because it was \""very expensive.\""  He watched me while I tried it on and then immediately took it off me.  I wanted to tell him that $400 wasn't pricey for a winter coat and that I could easily afford it, but decided to walk out without purchasing it.  I won't be back."
4,"I am giving Soba 5 stars for the experience I had there, even though I'm not quite sure the food deserves the whole 5 stars (Maybe 4.5)\nMy boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary. We are poor college students we got dressed up for our special dinner. We ordered several small plates: the Indonesian corn fritter wrap, the spicy tuna maki, the chicken and vegetable spring rolls, the korean barbecue ribs, and... something else! \nThe ribs were probably the best, and the corn fritter and tuna maki were also great. I was disappointed by the spring rolls - they were of good quality, but they were somewhat bland, and I expect a little more at a place (and a price!) like this. \nFor dessert we had the vanilla-poached peach with raspberry granita, coconut tapioca and brown sugar-barley crisps - this was fabulous! The combination of textures and flavors was superb. This appears to no longer be on the menu.\nThe real treat of the evening was the service we got from our waiter. We wanted to order sake, but we are sake noobs and had no idea where to start. Our waiter brought us a tasting tray of three very different sakes, all of which were delicious. We made a decision, ordered a carafe, and settled down to eat and drink and, uh, gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. As we were finishing our small plates, the waiter sidled up to our table and replaced our empty carafe with a full one, winking at us and saying \""Will you look at that!\"" \nWe were very pleased with our experience at Soba and it made a great anniversary dinner."
4,"I was here this past week while visiting. The food was superb. The seared tuna was amazing-the best I've had anywhere. The scallops were also excellent. Appetizers were delicious. The restaurant is beautiful, dimly lit, and very relaxed. Our server, Amanda, was great-really knowledgeable and helpful. Lookinf forward to my next trip to Pitt. to come back here."
4,"We found Soba to be very unique and relaxing. We absolutely loved the smooth rock water feature expanding two floors and an entire side of one wall. Very peaceful.\n\nWe tried their farm feast tasting menu event for $35 per person, including four courses. You may also accompany the courses with a wine paring for $20, giving you four different types of wine with each serving. We thought the cost was a great value.\n\nThe thing I love most about a tasting menu is that you don't have to worry about decisions. The menu is already planned. I'm sure many people would have an issue with this, but as a foodie, there is nothing better than to experience new cuisines. If you are one of those picky people, you can order off Soba's Japanese-fusion style menu.\n\nBecause we were blown-away from the atmosphere, outstanding service, and talented chefs, Soba made our Pittsburgh Favorite list at www.GirlLikesToEat.com//pittsburghfavorites/\n\nThis is for sure an exquisite dining experience."
4,Excellent food. They did a great job with the renovation- the place is swank!
2,"Not my cup of tea. I did not like my tuna entree, despite it being somewhere around $35. \n\nI do enjoy their cocktails, and like to come to the bar for happy hour."
4,"Consistently outstanding and creative food served professionally in a great and even varied ambiance. What more could you ask for? Oh yes, excellent wine list and drinks."
4,Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase. Like the tatami mat seating as well.
3,"Two Words: Frozen Cosmos\n\nYou need no other motivation to go to Harris' (although, the food and service is good too)"
1,"This place is going downhill fast. I went for the infamous bacon night this past Tuesday and wow - it sucked. First off, our waitress just wasn't good. She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later. Bacon doesn't take that long to cook. Then, we had to ask for ranch with our wings - which we'd already requested, but she'd brought us bleu cheese instead. Oh, AND they were out of bacon wings! On bacon night! WTF. \n\nAnyways, we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies, which is normally brought out with them, plates (b/c we were sharing several appetizers), and ketchup. Why ketchup? Let me tell you. We'd ordered the sliders as well, and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I've ever seen. \n\nThey were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps - like the size of a saucer that you'd put a tea cup on. And there were only TWO of them. Two! For six bucks I'll go get six non-mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds. And to top it off, they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING. \n\nI got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order, and they were served on a fanciful, long plate with a selection of condiments - you know, ketchup, tomato, onion, mustard, etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day. So, that was really disappointing. But it wasn't over.\n\nThe bacon \""baskets\"" arrived. The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there, right? Nope. There were literally exactly four sad little pieces. The big basket only made 'em look all the sadder. And they'd somehow managed to burn half of each slice black, while the other half was rubbery and undercooked. Yuck. \n\nOverall, I would never go back again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a gift certificate. The only things Harris has going for it right now are its patios, cleverly written menu, and nice location on Ellsworth ave. Oh, and a lot of condescending d-bags, if you're into that kinda thing."
1,"harris grill, i think  your menu is trying too hard.\n\nfirst place i went on my visit to pittsburgh.  menu was a little overly silly, waitress was a little underly friendly/helpful/timely, and food, while decent, was overpriced for the quality.\n\ni may be back to pittsburgh, but won't be back to harris grill"
3,"Just around the corner from my work, me and a few coworkers came looking for some play!  We went early and got a cush spot on the top floor with the window.  Clearly it's a hot spot in the neighborhood because it was packed by 7 pm on a Tuesday?!  The outside seating area was buzzing even in the chilly fall weather.  \n\nThe first quenching sip of that half-price RASPBERRY COSMO and I was sold!  Add on some true \""Pittsburgh\"" food (I'm talking about putting fries in a salad, oh yes!) and other yummy munchies like a super stuffed chicken quesadilla and our fun time was complete!"
1,"Disclaimer: This review is only for their Sunday brunch. Wasn't impressed by their Sunday brunch. Didn't like the presentation of the buffet. It was in a small area and felt kind of cramped. The salad was made with iceberg lettuce and didn't look appetizing. My friends ordered orange juice and each glass was filled to the brim with large pieces of ice, which means that they really just had maybe 1/2 a glass of orange juice. In all, it's really nothing special, just very basic. It was my first time eating at Harris Grill. What seems nice is the patio and if the weather had been nice, we would've sat outside and maybe I would've given it an extra star."
3,Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though.
3,"Sunday night, one week after the Steelers were officially \""out\"".  The restaurant was not crowded.  There were (2) 20-somethings and (2) 50-somethings which turned into (2) Burgers (1) Pulled Pork and (1) Angus Salad.  \n\nEverything was done perfectly.  Calamari was spicy, tender and fantastic.\n\nService was good and everyone was friendly.  Almost too dark to enjoy the meal, but ok.  We all agreed that we'd like to go back and try out a few other menu items.  Especially in the summer, to try out the patio!"
1,"This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \n\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area."
2,"Elbow room has some great things going for it. \n\nIt has a reasonable menu, without being 'bar food'...They changed the menu recently - so the food has changed somewhat - mostly for the better!  The Johnny Appleseed Chicken Sandwich was very good.  Salads are also good choices.\n\nThey moved all of their wine to a wall, so there is no list - you get up and explore.  It's a novel idea - but I wasn't interested in exploring that particular night.  \n\nThey have a back patio, that is often forgotten...so in nice weather, you have a better chance there than at Harris Grill.  \nService is fine.  \n\nAll in all, it's one of my top picks for an average night out."
1,"Went to Elbow Room for a nice Sunday brunch experience. It was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly. My girlfriend ordered the album pancakes while I ordered the crab Eggs Benedict.  Her pancakes were absolutely inedible, with such a bizarre after taste that we had to say something to the waitress. The kitchen also forgot to put any hollandaise sauce on my eggs and it looked like a 10 year old had poached them. The asparagus was raw and there were a few bits of crab, so little I thought they had forgotten that too. By the time I got any hollandaise the eggs were cold and the whole plate was ruined. When we said something about the pancakes the waitress apologized profusely and brought out some fresh French Toast, but stated that the cooks also thought something was wrong with the pancakes - - - why did she let us order them, then?? Makes no sense.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and very attentive, but the cooking left a lot to be desired. We won't be going back there for brunch anytime soon. Worst Eggs Benedict experience I've ever had."
4,"I just got my hair done at Dean of Shadyside Salon with Valerie. My cut was amazing. She listened to what I wanted out of my hair cut and gave me advice on what I should do to achieve the look I wanted as well. \nI was so excited about my cut, I re-booked for cut and color."
0,"Given the big salon, I think your experience will be highly related to which stylist you chose. I bought a Groupon for a level 3 haircut and moisture treatment. The stylist Ken spent 5 mins for the cutting, 40 mins to blow the hair dry and chatting and forgot the moisture treatment. The technique of the haircut is so poor. There is no layer of the cutting and it is not horizontally on the same level. I think he is not serious about what he did. I will not come for the second time. MCN is much better in this sense. You should definitely try to avoid him as your stylist if you choose to go to Dean of Shadyside."
2,"Typical sports bar with great wings! Kitchen Sink Wings were $.50 each the night we went. The fried zucchini was great as well (more breading then zucchini, but it doesn't matter after a few beers). We also tried the nachos and tater tots, which were fine. Service was great! They also have daily beer specials."
0,I'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible.  This is the worst spot on Walnut St!  I'm not even sure where to start. The bar is small and overpriced. I had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved.  The vegetables weren't even cooked. This is a place no one wants to--or should ever want to go.
2,With such great reviews I have been trying! I have been there tree times now and I am not surprised! The prices are reasonable and you get decent food. But thats not what I expected. The chocolate and caramel trotewas bad! The cupcakes were ok but for 1usd you can't expect much. The buttercream wasnt impressive... But the filled croissants with blueberry or the one with cheese were not bad at all. It was not a real croissant but satisfying. Since it is in a really convenient location I will probably go back but without the expectations that I had before.
4,"They have the best Burnt Almond Torte, so Good!   And if you like lady locks their the best I've had also.  Another of my favorites are the little cake cups they make .  There are a variety, like Burnt Almond Torte, Cookies and Cream, Pumpkin cheesecake, Vanilla Raspberry, German Chocolate, and so on.  Its the perfect miniature dessert!\n\nFor my daughters wedding I ordered five dozen of these for the cookie table. They were a nice addition to the cookies and display beautifully.  They were a Big Hit!"
1,"Almond torte cake is way too overhyped.  I ordered one after seeing an article on Huffington Post so with a description like that who wouldn't want to try it!?  It's a diabetics worst nightmare, sugar overload. The filling in the middle had a bland taste, nothing special about it. Maybe it's because I ordered the cake and had it shipped to MD that it tasted bad.  People raving about this cake should try middle eastern or Greek bakeries! I gave a two because they have great customer service when emailing back."
1,"Didn't havana go out of biz? I think this is the place with the purple awning. If not, oops! This place is OK. It does have a swanky feel and the martini's are OK but overall it is nothing special. Usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on Ellsworth."
3,"This is a pricey Japanese grocery store with a wide variety of goods.  I know it better as our Saturday go-to place for BENTO BOXES.  Oh yes, they are so good.  They are made fresh daily by the nice Japanese mom and pop that own the place.  They make sushi as well and it is expensive but it really does taste a million times better than the Giant Eagle stuff.  They also sell SASHIMI grade fish so we tried our hand at sashimi cutting one afternoon as well."
2,"This is my main place for groceries since it is super close to my house, so I've had a variety of experiences here.  I think the trick is to go on a Saturday when you have a lot of time and patience, or be prepared for some delays if you go after work.  I have a few gripes and a few praises, but its easiest if I list it out by category, so here it goes:\nParking: Lot and parking garage (with elevator) - be prepared to fight over a spot on busy days, and wait a few minutes for an elevator if you go in the garage. \nProduce: Plentiful, and usually fresh and tasty, but prices are up there with whole foods - over $1 for an apple or a tomato, and almost $3 for an avocado.  \nPrepared Foods: Mediocre tasting, decent variety.  Good looking salad bar as well.\nAssociates: Knowledgeable and helpful\nSelf Checkout/ Self Scanning:  I use both frequently and run into an issue about every other time I use either.  \nGeneral Products: I must agree with Barrientos M. review, because many times things I'm looking for are expired!  They have a large selection and it includes many specialty items, but in my opinion they are not organized very well.  \nStore Layout: There is a reason they give you a map, this place is very confusing and large.  The specials placed in the aisles are HORRIBLE, they create backups and clusters and I've seen 'cart to heel' accidents; this place is too crowed for the layout."
1,"If you live in the city of Pittsburgh and don't want to drive to Wal-Mart, Giant Eagle - otherwise known as \""the Dirty Bird\"" or \""Gian' Iggle\"" if your accent's just right, is where you will shop. Period, end of discussion. Generally, I think monopolies are very bad, and this goes double for grocers because they know their customers are held hostage and can thus attempt whatever fuckery they'd like. Over the past decade, most other Giant Eagle locations in Pittsburgh's East End were shuttered, meaning that the Negley/Centre store serves everyone. \n\nPerhaps my biggest gripe with \""Market District\"" is that our bills at this Giant Eagle were consistently 15-18% higher than our bills at any other grocery store, in any city I've shopped in - and that's WITH the coupons and Advantage Card \""discount\"" added on. I guess in the end, calling something a Market District Giant Eagle is a clever way of telling customers \""We stock all the same crap you'd find at a regular store, but now we can charge you even MORE for pretending it's premium, organic, or has been blessed by Emeril Lagasse.\"" You also need to know that over-crowding is unavoidable at this store, unless you like to start your errands around 10 PM, and even then, it's helpful to remember that customers exceed checkout lanes. Good thing we lived within walking distance of this location, because parking at this store is only marginally easier than driving a caravan of elephants through Manhattan at rush hour. \n\nThis store was never wanting for basic grocery staples when we shopped, but the \""Market District\"" moniker somehow demanded that the aisles be set up to be as maximally non-sensical as possible. Do you want juice? Save your sanity, and don't expect it to be near the other juices...you'll want to look near the pasta, of course! To keep you on your toes, the store managers also randomly change the aisles at this Market District around a couple times a year. This is a common retail trick, intended to create \""excitement\"" among customers, but really, all it does is make getting groceries as enticing as getting kicked in the balls. And who is stocking the produce at this place? Everything we bought would rot between 24-48 hours after we brought it home, and the peppers and tomatoes regularly looked like Mickey Rourke's face after his plastic surgery disasters.\n\nMy last visit to this Market District store left me with an exceedingly sour taste in my mouth, thanks to some shady hijinks at the pharmacy. We picked up my husband's script for a Schedule II medication, and soon after, discovered to our mutual horror that the pharmacy had shorted us 12 pills. 1 or 2, maybe 3 - that's an innocent mistake. A 12 pill shortage on a 30-pill prescription means someone chose a career in pharmacy to feed an addiction or run a little hustle on the side, and it means my husband will be going without. We asked the manager, \""Dude, what the fuck,\"" and the response we got was, \""We didn't do nuthin'!\"" Two weeks later, they had the nerve to Robo-Call my husband asking if he was interested in some \""valuable grocery coupons.\"" Nice attempt at a save there Bub, but next time, don't snatch our money and we won't need those \""valuable\"" coupons after all. (Isn't it also fascinating that we've been shorted on scheduled meds at other pharmacies before, but no one pockets our migraine meds, antibiotics, or other items you can't sell to teenagers in an alley?)\n\nTwo stars because the check-out staff is nice and the pasta/kosher deli selections rock. Otherwise, it's a grocery store, and a below-average one at that."
2,"God, I hate you Market District.  Most times I come here, I have to restrain myself from screaming at the top of my lungs.  But.....ala Breakfast Club John and Claire, I also love you, and I hate myself for that.  Hence, my 3-star review.\n\nThe Shadyside Market District is great in the sense that they have everything you need.  And then some.  Plus things you didn't even know you needed (buffalo flavored hummus for 6.99?  Sure!  Get in my belly.....I mean, cart).  But, whoa, it's totally over-priced.  As my mom would say \""city prices\"".  And the parking lot is cut-throat; I recommend entering the parking garage on the Negley Side for a slightly-less congested time.\n\nMarket District does make an effort to carry local products and produce, so gotta give them props for that. \n\nNote that only Advantage Card users can utilize the self-checkout, and you have to scan your card first before your food."
4,"Platinum Blonde Perfection.  Jay works wonders and he has given me the best platinum blonde 'do ever.  It was gorgeous.  My hair looked like corn silk.  If I had boat-loads of money, I'd fly him out to LA every 6 weeks for a touch up.   Go to see Jay...tell him Laura from LA sent you."
3,"I do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that I want, but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items. And the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him! He can help you a lot."
1,"After months and months on hiatus I have made a resolution that I think I'll actually be able to keep (unlike the NYE 'resolutions' exercise and less carbs) and that is to get back to the good work of keeping up with yelp and my amateur reviews.  It started to feel like homework, but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  Now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However, I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\""Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\""...\""Sure, what is it?\"".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole."
4,"Let's say I am slightly biased, because I'm pretty certain I am Girasole's biggest fan... No seriously...  I recently moved to Houston (well 5 years ago now), and I literally arrange to meet family and friends at Girasole, because as much as I love my family and friends, let's face it, I plan my trips home around Girasole.  I never miss the chance to dine here...and I typically will skip lunch as I tend to eat a lot... hey Houston does NOT have decent Italian food and even if they did, it wouldn't be Girasole!  I ALWAYS have the spinach & ricotta ravioli with the salad AND of course I never skip the Gnocchi (I swear both sauces are some of the BEST in the entire world)... I usually skip white bread, but not here, I use it to scoop up the extra sauce.  The tiramisu and lemon cake are to die for as well.  Be sure to tell Pi aka Mr. Girasole that Emilie from TX sent you... it's literally my home away from home!"
2,"My husband and I went here on a Friday night and surprising were seated immediately at a sidewalk table even though we did not have a reservation. Girasole was, as advertised, a very charming cafe with many things to recommend it. \n\nThe food was good, but it lost some points with both of us for quality of service and the limited nature of the menu. Our waiter was attentive--until the entrees were served. Then he disappeared. Not only did he disappear but every other server went deaf. They were not so busy that this was necessary. For the size of the restaurant and the number of servers it should not have taken an additional 20 minutes after we had eaten to have plates cleared.  There was a busboy but he was kind of useless. \n\nMy husband had the ravioli and I had polenta, both of which were very nice, and we shared a slice of rum cake that was excellent. My suggestion to anyone going there is to look at the online menu first. What you see there is what they will have, period. If nothing looks good it may be a good night to try another spot."
4,"Their appetizers are very very good... I also like their daily menu, fresh stuff and high quality ingredients. The salad that comes with any entree is awesome! Overall, excellent. I go there regularly. It usually gets very crowded though, so plan ahead."
2,"Service can be a bit slow at times. Also, I rarely see the place crowded. Still, its a good place to eat. Usually people go for the daily specials, where they give you a big plate with their house salad (delicious), a daily-changing entree, rice and some bread. It's about 10 dollars. They usually have 2 vegetarian and 2 non-vegetarian daily options. I love their limeade (its terrifically bright and fresh, made from real limes). Also, if you happen to be really rich (which I'm not) you might fancy buying some of the Peruvian art they sell in the store. Try touching the pelts on your way out, probably the softest fur you've ever felt in your life. Also, they have fun finger dolls, knit to look like naked people. The nudists sell for about 3 bucks a pop though..."
0,"I've been there twice to have dress clothes tailored. The first was for a full suit and a pair of pants. The owner said to return the following Saturday, which I did, and he did not have them ready. Not only that, but he acted like it was my fault I showed back up on time. \n\nSecond time same deal, two pairs of pants, not done on time and when they were done they were not tailored correctly. I'll be going out of my way to a different tailor from now on. \n\nIn addition, the prices are on the very high side without the service or results."
0,"I went there to get my dress hemmed last Wednesday and he said the next Thursday and when I went it to get it the day it was supposed to be done, he hadn't even started and he told me he was working on it right now which was a bold face lie. And when I went back to get it, he charged me for 30 for a simple dress hemming. It is such a rip off. I won't ever go back there."
2,"If you are drunk.... as in silly drunk, loud drunk, agitated drunk, confused drunk, mellow drunk, giggly drunk, lost drunk, or still-have-$5-in-your-pocket drunk... this is where you want to eat. \n\nYou're likely to have amusing memories here as you sort of sober up with other hungry drunk people who are all lured in by the aroma of pizza. Note: the pizza tastes like a slice-of-heart-attack during the daytime, however there is something oh so good about it when eaten at 1:45 am."
0,"Terrible! \n\nI'm pretty sure I am the apartment above Serena R's review.  The time frame matches up well.  \n\nI moved in around August 2010 to a first floor apartment (with a lower level Apartment below me)  Within the first weeks of my arrival, maintenance people were at my door nearly every time I tried to shower.   \n\nI'm a young girl, living alone, with guys unceremoniously entering MY HOME every time my shower leaks!   Originally, they tried to convince me I wasn't closing my shower curtain... but then a started collecting crocks full over debris and water from behind the shower plumbing access door.  THEY tried to convince me that cups full were purely pipe condensation.   It took 6 months for them to resolve this situation. At one point, they even asked me NOT to use the shower.  \n\nA year later, the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak.  The wall began to crack and before long a grotesque, pink mold covered the backside of the layers of tan paint that fell from my walls and ceiling.  I was spending most of time out of town with a family illness when I noticed this happening.  When I stopped by the office to pay my rent, I talked to 3 people about what was happening... nothing was corrected UNTIL they started showing my apartment to potential tenants.  \n\nI used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired."
0,"One of the worst mgmt companies i have ever dealt with.  The policies in their building are obviously very outdated but they refuse to make themselves better to serve their clients.  As long as they can wipe their hands clean, they are ok with it.  One aspect that they are great at is dishing off responsibility and making zero effort to give the tenants a better experience.  Mgmt does not think how to resolve the issue, instead they will cite a policy to justify why they cannot help you."
2,"Definitely a great place to go if you've had a long night of drinking. They even have a special called the \""Morning After Breakfast\"". I found the food greasy, and the pancakes, I wish they had a more regular style. But it's a great place to meet up and catch up with friends! It is cash-only, btw."
2,"I think it's the lack of breakfast places in Pittsburgh that makes Pamela's so popular. I couldn't find anything special here except the value. You really get a lot of food for you money, and it's pretty good food, but it's not spectacular. I'll go on a weekday, but the wait on weekends isn't worth it. I can just stay home and eat cereal, thank you."
0,"Pamela's is an abomination of a breakfast place that represents the worst of everything.  However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.\n\nIt is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).\n\nIf you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.\n\nBetter alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Caf\u00e9 or even Square Caf\u00e9, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.\n\nFrankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.  At least they have heard of this thing called \""butter.\"""
2,"Iv'e been to better places. I always forget that they dont take a card so I have to remember to get cash out when I go there. I usually order their omelets. The veggies are always crunchy so I taste more of a raw onion than I do my omelet. The food comes out fast which is great until I tasted the food. I checked it out three or four times  to see if it might be different but the omelets were the same. Raw and crunchy. overall  nice atmosphere, nice service, but the food is blah"
2,"Great hotcakes. No so great wait.  The hotcakes are worth trying, but there are other places in Pittsburgh that have much shorter waits that I prefer."
2,"So many great reviews.  Friends who live or have lived in Pittsburgh rave about this place.  It was supposed to be THE PLACE for breakfast and brunch in this city.  I first visited this place on a short Pgh Apt hunting trip back in April 2013.  Went in, got excited, as the place was packed with people.  It had the classic diner feel.  It had to be good.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Not wanting to give up hope, I went back to Pamela's the next day, and went with the corned beef hash, since many yelpers had mentioned it.  Again, disappointed.  Having settled in Pgh for a few months now, I decided to give Pamela's a third chance recently.  *sigh.  I don't get how this place has such high yelp ratings.\n\nFood = (6.5/10) = As mentioned above, my first visit I tried the western omelet.  It was just ok.  Not well seasoned, and the cheese was meh.   Quantity wise, you do get a huge amount of food for what you pay for.  Second trip was the corned beef hash trip.  Really don't understand what is so great about this dish.  My third trip I tried the tex-mex omelet.  Again, eggs under seasoned, and cheese was meh.  What bothered me the most was the \""guacamole.\""  It's more like avocado paste with mayonnaise consistency.  Like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. Texture was not appealing.  The friend who came with me on this third trip ordered the pancakes, which he thought were fine.\n\nAmbiance = (7.5/10) = it's got the classic diner feel, with diner friendly waitresses/waiters.  \n\nService (8.0/10) = as mentioned above, the classic diner friendly environment.\n\nOverall opinion = I wonder if those who give high ratings to this establishment, are the locals of Pgh, and college/grad students on a budget and naturally appreciate the large quantities of food for cheap prices.  This place is just ok for me.  I'm still searching for my go-to-brunch place in Pittsburgh.  I do recommend trying this place out and making your own judgement, especially if you've just moved to the area.  There is always a wait to get in on weekends, so they must be doing something right.  Place is cash only."
0,"The food here is over the top excessively greasy. So greasy that it made me sick to my stomach before I was done eating my meal. My husband and I split the chocolate chip pancakes and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and toast on the side. Not only was everything in a pool of grease, but it seemed to be margarine...not even real butter. I will never eat here again. I am gagging even thinking about this meal let aloe eating it again."
3,"Good food, cooked well, came out hot. Service was also very good. Waitress came back to top off coffees more than once. Prices also good, but cash only. Wouldn't wait if a really long line, but definitely would go early to get a better than average breakfast out."
3,"Nice cozy underground restaurant that serves crepes and a great Cafe au lait.  They have plenty of sweet crepes and a few savory ones.  They could add a couple more savory ones, but otherwise I would definitely eat there again."
0,"Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted \""help wanted\"" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe."
3,Cash only. We love their Crepes. I don't like latta that much. It is good experience.
3,"Cash only. Cute place, good crepes, good coffee."
2,"Its americanized, but pretty tasty! I love the fried rice and usually just get that. We were getting takeout once and waited at the bar, and the bartender gave us free tastes of the lychee cocktail while we waited! And that was tasty too!\n\nIts also never crowded, its quiet and the service is consistently not bad. \n\nAll that being said though, there isn't really anything special about this place. Its just kind of...eh... Best as take out."
2,"Moving from the Midwest, I was pumped when I found this place at their former location in Squirrel Hill and discovered their vast vegetarian menu. General Tso's soy protein is a winner, although a bit sweet. They retained their veg menu at their Shadyside site and it's the same. Lunch is the way to go here--very expensive otherwise. Beware of soup--kind of got congealed in transit. \n\nOverall, this place holds a special place in my heart as it's very veg-friendly. However there are better Chinese places in PGH."
1,"What has happened to this place? Used to be delicious, but something's changed! Rude host...pointed us to a table (of course the personal cell phone BS going on with a friend was far more important) for a noon lunch, in a nearly empty restaurant. Nor good signs and we should have walked out then. We started with a bland egg roll. Moved on to fair won ton soup. Entrees of cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken, both on brown rice we're disappointing. Left us both wishing that we had gone for Thai food down the street instead! Save yourself and opt for one of the other fabulous dining experiences in Shadyside!"
4,I love their vegan / vegetarian menu! The food is so good! Just remember to ask them to hold the MSG! \n\nFriendly service. Clean. Nice atmosphere.
0,"Had a craving for Chinese the other day while I was in Shadyside and wandered into China Palace.  How this place can stay in business in an area that I consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery.  It was just awful and the service was terrible.\n\nI wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter, but asked if I could substitute one of the items with dumplings.  Our waiter had to ask the manager.  After much whispering, the manager came back to me and told me that I could have dumplings...then I asked if I could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed.   Well I was met with an outraged \""NO\""!!!!  It kind of surprised me that I got this kind of reaction.  I was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter.  I looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant.  Isn't that what they're supposed to do?  Cook food for people to eat?  I would have never asked if I thought it would be such a big deal.  \n\nAnyway, the food was not very good.  In fact, it was awful.  \n\nWere they having an off day?   I'm not sure they were.   There's never any reason to be rude to your patrons.  No need to ever return."
0,The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it.
0,"I just got back from dinner with my family at the old place and I can't emphasize enough my disappointment. The service was poor. Our waitress was a nice gal who was working hard, she simply had too many tables because the place was woefully understaffed. Our drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and she was usually too busy to check on us. I had to go and find her a few times to get things that were missed. \n\nI don't mind paying the high prices of the old place if the food is good. Unfortunately the food was a let down. Four of us ordered the French onion soup. The soup was so salty it was rendered uneatable. The steak was good, but the baked potato was so dry I thought it left over from lunch. My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite bland. Everything else we ordered was just ok. To sum it up, our meal was mediocre at best and we were all disappointed. Not one person on our party of seven really enjoyed their meal. \n\nI express my dissatisfaction with our waitress and she informed me that she would write my complaints in a book they kept. That was it. I left with the feeling that they were happy that they got my money and that they did not really care that my family's dinner was poor. They made no effort to make it right and they made no effect to ease my displeasure. \n\nThis will be my last family dinner at the old place. I will take my business to a place that has better food and a place that values it's customers."
2,"Believe it or not, I have never had a Philly cheese steak... until now. \n\nI really liked the decor. It reminded me of a modern diner/ regular bar. The staff were really friendly and clean! Since they cook everything right in front of you, I expected their shirts to be dirty. I was pleasantly surprised! \n\nIt was my first time eating a Philly cheese steak so it was hard for me to rate it. I didn't think they would give you such a long sandwich for only 6 dollars. I was full before I ate half the sub. The meat taste good but it was really dry. Are you suppose to put something else other than lettuce on a cheese steak sub? Overall, it was just okay."
2,Good food.  Quick delivery.  *CAUTION*  The $2.00 delivery charge is not listed on the menu.  SURPRISE...It's listed on your bill.  *CAUTION*   A tad pricey.  Oh yeah..I live in Pittsburgh now...
1,"Love their coffee.\nThey need to add help in the morning.\nWith all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.\nI'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.\nUsually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel\nThey should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business."
2,"I stopped in here last night for dinner with my girlfriend.  I had been wanting to come here since I randomly caught it on an episode of \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\"" and last night was the perfect night for us.  The outside of the building is unassuming and we drove right past it before noticing that we had.  The inside of the building is not much better as it looks like your normal neighborhood bar with a bunch of flat screens T.V's on the wall, a U shaped bar on one side, booths and high top tables on the other and a back dining room.  My girlfriend and I tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths.\n\nThe bar seemed quite full for a Tuesday evening and our waitress (the bartender) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves.  After only a short wait, she was at our table taking our drink order.  I was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd.  For dinner I decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies (3) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw.  The pierogies were absolutely enormous, almost as long as my hand and fried slightly, topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce.  Our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined.  They tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty.  By the time we were done with them, we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist.  My sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild.  I topped it with hot sauce and like a true Pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better. My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that I took gave me a nice buffalo flavor.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I am glad that I came here and might be back again depending on what I am looking for.  The food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $22 and it exceeded the expectations that I had given to it whenever we walked in.  However, with that being said, the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so I wouldn't expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted."
1,"Dont' mind me... I'm just practicing for when I don't remember stuff. Like two weeks ago when I stayed here for three days? I was surfing the Pittsburgh yelp pages, and knowing I had to return to Pittsburgh next week for software training, decided to \""check out the hotel\"" that we'd be staying at for four days. When I got to the review page for this Radisson, it hit me....... \""Been there, done that.\""\n\nShort opinion here. Being a native SoCal person, I benefit from a great choice of hotels, throughout the Western states. So for years, when I've had to go back East, I prepare myself for older properties, musty rooms, and usually....... older bathroom fixtures, accompanied by really aged tile grout! If any of the above rings a bell...... you won't be disappointed.\n\nIt's really not that bad, but we West coasters are a bit spoiled. They do have a decent bar-restaurant. But as others have mentioned, this property exists on multiple levels. For instance...... the parking lot in the back? You get off the elevator on the 5th floor. If you're going to the bar, THEN you hit \""Lobby\"" and end up at the bottom of the hillside, which is still elevated above the access road. Sounds a bit convuluted, but it's not that bad. I think I just like to complain a bit....... you get that way after your 39th birthday.   :-)"
3,"This is a very family-friendly, casual seafood restaurant with nice portions and great prices.  They serve both fried and broiled seafood, as well as steak and chicken. I had the broiled salmon with the baked sweet potato and salad bar.  I also tried a vinegar-based cole slaw (think similar to cold sauerkraut) from the salad bar and it was great. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient."
1,"Took my Mom here today for a post Mother's day lunch. It's been about a year since our last visit. Salad bar is a one trip deal only and the salad plates are smaller than I remember last time. Hushpuppies are 2 bite sized and are very good with the right amount of sweetness and onion. My Mom got the senior flounder plate and I got one of the specials which was salt and pepper catfish fillets. Both included a side and the one trip to the salad bar.\nFood was good, but both our flounder and catfish were on the thin side and not very meaty. Service was very friendly and attentive.\nLunch set me back $23 with drinks tax and tip which I thought was really pricey for lunch especially with the thin pieces of fish and considering my Mom ordered off of the senior menu and I got one of the specials."
3,"Always had great food, Try the clam chowder!!!"
0,"My biggest complaint deals with packages coming into the facility from private carriers like FedEx. If you've ordered a package and this happens, expect to wait about a week for them to deliver the package. Two day shipping turns into a week and a half. \n\nLong, long wait in lines. No concern for your packages. Terrible delivery - drivers have crammed packages into my box causing damage. If you can afford to, go with UPS."
2,"Well my first time at the gun range,and I must admit...it was FUN! So here goes my Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n1. Knowledgeable Staff\n2. Plenty of fire power\nsadly that's where it ends\n\nCons:\n1.BUSY-that's good thing for them, but you will have a wait! Especially on weekend\n2.Small-there were people sitting on the floor, standing in corners. Literally shoulder to shoulder\n3.Flustered Range officers-they are not unfriendly, just a lil overwhelmed by the amount of people and trying to keep up with everything going on. I guess I would be too if  30 people carrying rifles and pistols came walking through the door all at once\n4. Price-seemed expensive to me. I shared a lane & gun plus ammo with my two sisters for 30 minutes and it came to $88!  All I remember hearing was $15 per gun\n\nNot a bad place to visit if  you've ever wanted to go to a range, just keep in mind the small size and the long lines.."
4,"I love New China. The service is always fast and fresh! The sweet tea is amazing. Yes, Chinese takeout is everywhere but no one can Beat NEW China in Belmont!"
2,"We've never been here when there is much life in this place, but i still kind of like it. Whenever we are there, it feels more like a hangout for a few folks to have a drink at the bar, but they have ample space to be a full-fledged restaurant. The most spacious, spread out dining area in Belmont it seems. i just need to go at a better time when there is a crowd here (assuming that time exist) to get a true feel for them. There are a few paintings on the wall that contrast the drab overall feel at night. \n\nWe have enjoyed their Chicken Jalapeno Dip twice now. Pretty tasty and pretty filling for two people. We split that with an entree and left full. \n\nTheir Facebook page said something about a new tv and game room, it must have been in the back because we were watching sports on an antique television over the bar. They did have $1 Budweiser cans when we were there and Southern Tier on draft. Seems to be something on special most days."
3,"I came here in October and ended up going on the \""Ghost Tales in the Dark\"" tour. Pretty much, you get a candlelit tour of the plantation at night. And your tour guide gives a history lesson on the house and plantation, as well as shares some ghost stories that either they/coworkers have experienced.\n\nIf you come at night, it can be a little scary getting here. Once you turn off the main street, you're driving down a dark road with nature on both sides of you. Since we were already in a spooky spirit, it kind of felt like we were in a horror movie, hehe. Once you arrive at the plantation though, you just park and walk into their little gift shop. After everyone arrives, you watch a little video about the history of the place, including paranormal history. After that, your tour starts.\n\nYou walk over to the house, and tour the house, from downstairs to upstairs. Then, you walk outside to the outdoor kitchen, and then to a workmen's shed. Then you walk past an old log cabin, and then get led back to the main gift shop. \n\nThe tour guide we had a was a very informative old lady. She told us a lot of history, and I learned new things. At one point of the tour, I did get a little lightheaded, and felt a little weird, and it was near an area where the tour guide said that she also has had weird feelings. What's even weirder is that on our back home, my dad was telling me that he got lightheaded in a certain area, and when I asked him where, it was the same place I had gotten the same feeling! It was kinda spooky finding that out, but then kind of cool.\n\nThe tour was about ~$10 and I think it was worth it. I got a little spook, and learned a good history lesson. And I visited a historic plantation.\n\nIf you're visiting the area, and are looking for something interesting and different to do, I suggest coming here. No matter what time of year. But if you happen to come during October, then you'll just get an added bonus of hearing some ghost stories along the way too."
3,"These guys definitely know how to make a good pizza. The crust is the perfect blend of chewy with a hint of crunch, totally foldable and delicious! Not only do the make a good pie, they do it quickly, even when it's busy, and get it to your door still hot and tasty. They've officially made it into my phone contact list!"
3,"They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\"" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again."
3,Very good classic New York pizza. I would highly recommend it. If you want to get the best pizza possible make sure you order light sauce. They tend to over do the sauce sometimes but overall great pizza place.
1,"\""Not quite what I expected... not quite WHERE I expected either...\""\nReviewed July 24, 2011\n4 people found this review helpful\nI have to agree with another reviewer in that I am not sure how this hotel qualifies as an airport hotel.\n\nI booked this hotel stay for a business (military) event. We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\n\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \n\nThe front desk clerk seemed \""oh-so enthused\"" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\n\nNow I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.\n\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\n\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\n\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\n\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \""airport\"".\n\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \n\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \n\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\n\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\n\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \""Deborah\"" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\n\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business"
1,"Lobby, restaurant, bar and internet area all look great and new! Room Service was great, fast and efficient. Check in was good, not great! They charge for internet service in the room, that's so 2008!\n\nThis is a typical 80 style building that was retrofitted and remodeled. So The main structure, bathroom and HVAC systems all pose a ongoing problem, no matter the extensive renovation.\n\nFrom a cleanliness perspective the room had spider webs around every corner of the ceiling."
1,"I get really annoyed with these \""fancy\"" hotels who don't offer the refrigerator and microwave in their standard rooms, which I can get at a Holiday Inn Express or a Comfort Inn for probably half the price.  \n\nAlso, for the love of all things holy, don't charge people for WiFi in 2011 after they already paid you an arm and a leg for a room that isn't worth it.  That is RIDICULOUS.\n\nThere's at least a half-mile walk (without a sidewalk) to anything except a small convenience store.\n\nThe room was comfortable enough, but no greater than any 3-star hotel I've ever stayed in."
1,This is a decent hotel.  Decent for a quick over-nighter if you've missed a flight.  But it's not good for longer stays or repeat visits.  The building itself needs updating.  The food at breakfast is OK. But lunch/dinner is like bar food.  Half of the floors don't have vending machines.  One of the floors that does does not offer drinks.  One machine that offered drinks keeps your money without providing a drink.  The other working machine is all out of stock.  Bottled water in the room is $4.00 (before they tack on other BS charges).  Internet access is $9.95 per day.  3G reception in the building is horrible too!  It's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.\n\nI'd recommend staying somewhere else if you can!
0,"I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. \nI started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \"" missing manual or dead battery\"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. \nI was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. \nI asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. \nI get \""as is\"" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.\nNow I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. \nThank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.\n\nPissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad"
3,"I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine."
2,"This is probably close to what most people expect for German food.  My expectations are high and I am a hypocrite for sure in almost everything!  With that understood...  read on:  The Pretzel Roll was very good (4.75 stars),  The kinda cubed and Fried Potatoes cooked with Bacon (called fries) ROCKED (5 yelp stars)!!! The service was very good, very team oriented.   Though I was pointing at what I wanted on the menu it took my server four guesses to get what I wanted.   It was impressive to me that he made sure!   Two waiters and a manager helped serve my table (I'm always impressed by a great team) so the service gets 4.9 yelp stars!\n\nWhen I go German I want BRATS!!!  So I had the Two Brat Lunch Platter (may be called something else) with Sour Kraut and a side of Red Cabbage!  One of the Brats was Good as in Maybe 3.5 yelp stars which means I would not get it again!  The other Brat was OK maybe 2.5 (I'm thinking that is generous though).  The gravy with the Brats was good and the mustard was very good and spicy.  Goulash (not spelled as they did) was in a thick \""hunteresk\"" type of homey (not the clown) gravy.  I took several small tastes to get the vegetables and meat and hesitate to give it a 2.25 yelp stars because I bet this is the flavor many people want!  Warm Sour Kraut was fresh (not canned) and was A-OK (3 yelp stars)  Warm Red Cabbage same story different flavor (less than three stars though).\n\nFor Dessert I should have gone somewhere else (and I did after I had it here).  The lady (maybe Manager/Owner? I'm guessing?) described the Black Forest Cake as being \""lite\"" !  When dinning out or in or anywhere \""lite\"" is usually (not always) NOT how I want most Desserts described!  Usually I want to hear:  Rich, sweet, creamy, Chocolaty, H E A V Y !  !   !  Calorie Laden and FULL of flavor!  Calories!  It's Friday, can't I be bad as I want to be one day (worse than I say I am too much of the time).  As my servers could tell I was not a small fan of the Black Forrest Cake - Not a small fan, not a fan at all!\n\nHerman the German was right!  Though I had to find out for my self!  I would go back now that I know some of what I do like and some of what I do not...  There were some other menu items I would check out!"
3,"Olde German Schnitzel Haus, our local award winning Germany restaurant, closed at the end of August. \n\nI found no less than three German restaurants, while searching on Yelp, and oddly enough they were all exactly one hour from Hickory: \n(1) \""Berliner Kindl German Restaurant\"" in Black Mountain. (Bookmarked)\n(2) \""The German Restaurant\"" in Yadkinville. (Fantastic!)\n(3) \""Waldhorn Restaurant\"" in Pineville. (Bookmarked)\n\nI have had Waldhorn on my \""to try list\"" seemingly forever, so I headed toward Pineville for lunch.\n\nI had every intention of ordering German sausages, sauerkraut, fried potatoes, and German beer, but they had a dish on the lunch menu that sounded appetizing. It was a veal dish with sauteed mushrooms in a brown gravy atop Sp\u00e4tzle, accompanied by saut\u00e9ed vegetables. This dish sounded good to me so I changed my mind at the last minute. It was delicious, but it was a very plain Jane looking dish, so I didn't take any photos. \n\nI was seated immediately, but it took a good ten minutes for the young male bartender to stop talking golf and NASCAR before he pulled my Spaten lager. When he did get around to his duties, he did a very good job. \n\nNote: Spaten brewery was started in the year 1397, and it is delicious beer! It is also deceptively potent. \n\nI also drank a Spaten Oktoberfest beer, and that was fantastic as well!\n\nI enjoyed Waldhorn, and it was well worth the hour's drive. \n\nWhen I return I will try an assortment of German sausages with mustard, sauerkraut, fried potatoes, and a German beer or two. \n\nWaldhorn Restaurant is highly recommended!"
2,"BJ's has an impressive amount of, well, stuff. This big-box store has just about everything you need, and then some. Clothes, furniture, food, you name it. \n\nThere are only 2 of us, but we still manage to buy enough to more than pay for our annual membership. Some of our best savings come from the produce, deli meats (super cheap!!!) and the paper goods. The monthly coupon book they send (also available on-site) yields additional savings. You will also find deep discounts on clothes, vitamins, books and DVDs. \n\nWe rarely have to wait in line for more than a few minutes, and the self check out is very convenient. \n\nThis store is reasonably clean, albeit a little dingy.  (I've seen a lot worse in these stores), The employees have always seemed friendly. \n\n3 stars for not having fresh-made (on-site) items like its competitors (this is not a deterrent for me), and for always having a nagging salesperson when you walk in. No, really, I still don't want Direct TV. Thank you. The shopping carts could also use some serious maintenance."
3,"I zoom. I zoom, I walk fast, I multitask - every movement I make is planned for efficiency. Therefore, Jason's Deli is my lunch spot of choice and here is why. I can just walk up to the salad bar kiosk, touch the screen a few times, slide my card and walk two steps to where a smiling person hands me my plate and cup. Quick. I have waited in line maybe one time even when the sandwich line is out the door. \nJason's salad bar is the best I have found. The ingredients are always fresh and the selection is good. Yes I am a fan of Jason's in Pineville."
1,"The entrance is hard to find/identify... the exit says Sears, but the entrance has a door that says Avis/Budget.  You have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys.  Waiting in line took roughly 20 minutes on a Tuesday about 12 noon.  \n\nI brought my car in for a simple oil change.. it took almost 3 hours.  Granted when they told me it was done, there were several things that Diego had found that I could fix in my car.. the list of repairs totaled over $800.  I didn't bring the car in for an inspection, just an oil change.. that's all I wanted.. could have saved time elsewhere.  It was about $40 for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon.\n\nThey assured me that the fluids (windshield washer, power steering, etc.) would be topped off; I checked in the parking lot afterwards and it was not done.  I was so fed-up with waiting so long that I didn't feel the need to wait even more."
0,"I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing. I honestly don't know how they are able to stay in business if they don't help customers or at least ask."
0,"Seriously, how many F words can you not use on a Yelp review? How do you order app, a salad and three entrees.  Salad came first then bruschetta (wtf) toast and tomatoes and cheese.  Don't give it a sweet name and take 50 minutes to make it.  Also the fact that we order lasagna and you are out of it?  You couldn't tell me that during the 50 mins that you were making bruschetta?  How long does it take to make lasagna?  Wait someone told me longer I'm sorry I didn't go to culinary school, I guess nether did your cooks \""I use cooks loosely\"".\nI would recommend a better Italian place but I'm Scottish, I would say stay home drink beer and make macaroni and cheese!"
3,We ordered the lobster and shrimp dip. We had to send it back twice because it was too cheeseeeee.. yes!! The chips kept breaking whenever we dipped it in the sauce because the cheese made it to heavy. They ended up taking it off the bill. We then tried the parmesan chicken and bake potato. It was gooood!!! It was enough for two to share.
1,"Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse."
2,"I hate malls! I wasn't a mallrat when I was a kid. I tend to avoid malls as much as possible Unfortunately, in a twist of fate, I was \""blessed\"" with two girls who are about to hit mallrat stage. Oh bliss!\n\nAnd this visit was 100% their fault. We hit all the \""cool\"" stores like P.S. by Aeropostale, The Children's Place, Build-A-Bear, The Rack Room... I'm feeling nauseous...\n\nMeh, it's a mall. Of all the malls in Charlotte this is the only one I'd ever really set foot in. It's very mall-like. It's not a narcissistic hellhole like Southpark, it's as generic as Northlake, it's not its own city like Concord Mills, it's not the arsehole of the world like Freedom (is that one still even there?). It's a mall."
2,"What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm? Let's go wander around there and watch the masses scramble for gifts.\n\nWhen I need to make a mall trip, this is not at the top of the list for me. I rank Northlake, SouthPark and Concord all above it. One: anything that involves 485 does not make me pleasant. Two: The store selection here is just kind of meh. Three: it's a pain to get in and out of this place.\n\nNow I will say this, there is an H&M on the way which could be a game changer for this place. It will be great for people on the south side of town since currently there is just the one location up at Northlake. Until SouthPark gets one, this one will do for our side of town.\n\nTypical anchor stores here. I don't want to say that it feels outdated... I don't think that's the right description. Maybe old school vibe is more accurate.\n\nIf I'm near this area and need a mall, I'll venture here. But with so many better options in the Charlotte area, it's definitely not a must-go shopping destination on my list."
0,"My mother wanted to take my wife and I out to dinner for my wife's B-day, we were a party of eight, we were assigned two waitresses that had a difficult time getting on the same page. Wrong order, wrong drink refills, and it took 1:49 from the time we placed our order until the food reached the table. A member of our party stated a food allergy, he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well, which took another 34 minutes, and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us, when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again, and I would suggest that you do the same. We were not the only ones with a grievance as several other \npatrons were given gift cards and comped bills."
1,"Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.\n\nWe were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.\n\nThe food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.\n\nTwo stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good."
4,Anything shiny grabs my attention immediately. I easily get distracted in Jared's. I went in to repair a bracelet I purchased over a year ago and I found myself lusting over case after case of jewelry.\n\nJared's offers great customer service. I purchased a couple items from one of their stores in Arizona and the location here was more than willing to help repair without charge. In both locations I've encountered very nice sales staff.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with buying me something at this store!
1,"New menus at ihop means higher prices! Wonderful. It seems that everything on the menu has gone up by at least $1.00 across the board. I had a Country Omelet with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelet was uninspired. It had no flavor whatsoever. Thank God for ketchup! The red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them.  THey were brown on the outside & an odd shade of dark pink on the inside. They also were flavorless but they had some sickeningly sweet cream cheese flavored paste drizzled all over them. Then the stack was topped with whipped cream. Whipped cream? Really? Maybe that goes over well with children but for an adult its a little creepy. The accompanying dinner theater provided by other diners & the sweet tea were the highlights of the meal.\n\nThe other strange thing about iHop is that the food never comes out hot, only warm. I think the grills are just for show. I think that they warm everything in an Easy Bake oven under a 10watt bulb."
0,"I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that, and kept trying to sell me crap.  Over-priced, slow, very dirty, and an overall sketchy vibe."
0,"I bought a number of items there. among them there was\n- 1 item off the floor it wasn't delivered on schedule no biggie\n- 1 entry door with transom ($500)\n- 1 custom window $1,200.\n\nThe style of the door and the transom didn't match, I called and was told \""that's what you ordered\"" . Really I asked for mismatched styles? I ordered for the lightest clearest low-e glass available, I got the dark type of glass that's recommended for Fla, Nm, Az etc. \"" That's what you ordered\"" was the response again. \n\nThey don't even bother to ask what was shipped or what you ordered, they don't want to know because CYA is the order of the day.\nThen when you go over your buyer's order you realize that regardless of the conversation you had with their salesperson the printed order is so vague that they could ship you anything at all and claim that's what you ordered. My contractor bought my siding there, it's an off-brand and the quality doesn't impress. \nReally shoddy practices\n\nI ordered the rest of the windows ( Andersen) from The Plywood Mart although they won't match these and they were more expensive, that shows how I feel about sponsoring this store again"
3,"We stayed at a hampton inn in concord one night, then this hampton the next night. This one was so much better, except for the room we were in. 602 made us both sick, it had a mold or something. The front desk was very courteous in moving us when this was mentioned and the 2nd room was very nice. Breakfast was delish. And the hotel is located in a very nice area, right next to southpark mall and right down the road from carowinds :)"
4,"I got stuck overnight in Charlotte and was placed here on a voucher from the airline. As a 20-something girl traveling solo at the time I was really afraid that this place would be sketchy, because I've had horrible luck in the same situation in Atlanta in the past. This hotel is extremely nice, clean, and up to date. The treadmills in their fitness center are awesome! The hotel staff was extremely nice and accommodating. The hotel restaurant was pretty good too. All in all a fantastic experience!"
0,"I almost hate writing this review, because Green's is such a Charlotte institution. I almost feel like I'm dissing my adopted city by saying this, but I just don't see what the big deal is about this place. When I first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as The Varsity in Atlanta. News tip: they aren't, and they aren't by a longshot. What's worse, the three or four times I've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent. Maybe the hot dog is cold, but the chili is hot. I dunno... I WANT to like this place, but just can't."
4,"Stayed here about a month ago.  This was really a great hotel.  It's very classic feel, but with brand new bedding, TV, and bathrooms so no old dirty feeling in the rooms.  The employees were super nice, I found a good rate online making it a bargain for downtown.  This is where I'll stay next time I'm in Charlotte."
1,"My husband and I visited the Dunhill, originally planning to spend our wedding night there. They are historic, quaint, and conveniently located in Charlotte. Walking in to the check-in desk was a breeze. Everyone was very friendly. Walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel. It really could use some restoring. The hotel room was small, bathroom was small as well (though they've tried to modernize it with decoration & hardware), and just overall underwhelming. The ceiling had many water spots where water had leaked from above and dried the ceiling yellow. They also have a restaurant in the hotel with good eggs benedict, but for the price, I wasn't impressed. Again, friendly, great historic hotel (which I normally love), but didn't live up to its reputation for us. (We visited before our wedding and booked a room at the Ritz, which in Dunhill's defense, was brand spankin' new.)"
4,"First class everything,  service incredible. Great hidden gem in the heart of Charlotte.  I recommend staying."
4,"Alexander Michael's is a hidden gem in the 4th Ward.  It's rare to see restaurants uptown remain open for 27 years, but you'll quickly find out why.  Its a pub with the charm of the Cheers bar (in a converted 100 yr. old house) and food that cannot be called \""grub\"".\n\nI visited last week and felt immediately welcome in this cozy tavern. Despite the busyness of that night, we were served promptly  The server was quite friendly; she offered suggestions of her fav dishes and the most commonly ordered ones.  After seeing the positive reviews for the London Broil sandwich, I opted for this sandwich with onion rings.  .   The London Broil sandwich was moist and bursting with flavor, like it was slow cooked.  The onion rings tasted homemade.  My friend ordered the copious bread pudding dessert and found it quite tasty as it was covered in caramel sauce.\n\nI think Alexander Michael's exudes \""chill\"" and this is what is so attractive about it.  The clientele was young and old; it neither felt like a country club or a college sports bar.  The TV's (though they show sporting events) don't distract from conversation like most sports bars and though there is a bar, I didn't see folks getting hammered on well drinks and PBR.  Great place to bring friends of all ages and family if they are visiting Charlotte."
3,"Back in Aug when I was out in Charlotte a co -worker took me to Alexander Michael's.  This place is a cute neighborhood gem.  I loved it!  It's removed from the main uptown area of Charlotte and it seems like this is the place where locals go.\n\nMy dinner was awesome.  I ordered their blackend cat fish sandwich with fried pickles.  Yum!  Since, fried pickles don't exist in CA, I loved eating them while I was out in Charlotte.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I would eat at this place again.   ;o)"
3,"In Charlotte for business and wanted some good local fair.  Fired up the Yelp and see Alexander Michael's getting awesome scores.  The map says 1.5 miles away and I don't have a car - going to have to hoof it.\n\nShow up about 7:30pm on a Wed.  Place wasn't crowded at all and I got sat right away.  The staff was nice.  I ordered the Fried Pickles as an appetizer.  Some people say they are too salty and I say, \""Well, they're pickles.\""  They get paired up with a cup of ranch, but I think they would have been better with Blue Cheese.  Hint: use just a little ranch on your fried pickle.\n\nNext up was a bowl of Spicy Crab Soup.  This is pretty much an enchilada soup with crab meat in it.  Not that that's a bad thing.  It's good soup.  But spicy?  No.  No it is not.\n\nMain course is the Blackened Catfish Sandwich.  This right here is what I'm talking about.  The filet is a monster.  A tasty, flakey monster.  They pair it up with a tarter sauce (did I detect a pepper in there?  Chipotle maybe?) and some kind of other sauce that was like a chunky salsa/sweet-n-sour thing.  Doesn't matter.  I dumped both of them on.  It was tasty as all get out.  I devoured the enormous sandwich. The side dish I chose was the Broccoli Slaw and honestly, it tasted like 'healthy'.  Skip it.  Do the cajun fries instead."
3,"As much as it was mentioned in every single tourist guide i could find of Charlotte, this is a homey, family restaurant with soul and a great vibe to it, NOT a tourist-magnet in any way shape of form. The people that work there were down-to-earth and friendly to the core. The service was swift, the mood great, the food delicious. What else to say? Love that place!\n\n\nTIP: Try their fried pickles! Oh my sweet goodness... best culinary surprise I've experienced in years. I was dying to order a second round of them because... wow... they were so good."
3,"A pretty good Morton's and your only option after the South Park location closed.  Located in the basement with lots of wood and leather.  Dinner in the bar area and the dining room a handful of times, and the service is stellar in both.  \n\nLast time I went in though (05/12), they were playing pop music instead of the old standby's and it was really odd, kind of ruined the mood."
1,For the price I was incredibly disappointed. My steak (medium rare) was totally over cooked. Our waitress forgot to place one of our side dishes so it came out when we were nearly done. Our waitress didn't offer any type of modifications for one of our gluten free diners and completely forgot the extra plates we asked for. \n\nThe only shining items from our meal were the mashed potatoes and wine.
2,"You know what it's like when you just don't know what to say?  This is one of those times.  You see, I'm often wondering if my mom is going to slap me for not saying anything nice and then bitch-slap me for never listening.  Or something.  I really wasn't paying attention.\n\nOr maybe it is not that bad.  There are, after all, nice things to say about Matt's.  But there are spotty areas as well.\n\nFirst the good...\n\nThe decor is marvelous (insert mid-80s Fernando accent via Billy Crystal here).  They have a decent number of seats, the outdoor seating is second-to-none - but you can bring your own lunch and get that, so it's not really specific to Matt's.\n\nAnd the not-so-good...\n\nThe menu selection is immense.  So much so that you'll want to go when the place isn't crowded so that you have a reasonable chance of looking it over before ordering so as not to get in the way of anyone else.  That generally doesn't happen in most hot dog stands, either on the street or indoors because you have about two choices: All the way or plain, where you add your own condiments.\n\nAnd the rest...\n\nThough you can find Italian Beef and Chicago-style dogs in the same place, you don't always want to.  Focus on your specialty.  And that's the real problem here.  There is so much going on - visually and on the grill - that they don't seem to do anything really well.\n\nThough the staff is nice enough, and food is decent, it's just not that great.  Fries are limp.  House-made chips are nice and thin, but they are so thin that they can't support anything (dressing, chili leavings from dogs, not even the crunch from the fryer).  Dogs are average.\n\nI would much rather get a dog from Green's, or maybe Hap's, both of which have that awesome hot dog counter vibe and make me want more.  Matt?  Not so much."
2,"While this place has a good # of tvs, for some reason I just don't enjoy watching games here. The view is decent from almost anywhere in the bar, but I think the lack of a loud fan base really takes away from the atmosphere. No one seems too thrilled that the games are on & not much cheering seems to be done. They also have a large projection screen showing the main game so if you can get a seat in front of this it's pretty good viewing. And flat screens are located throughout showing other games throughout the day.\n\nI've never had the food here, I've only been for the nightlife/game watching, so I can't comment on the menu or the food taste. There's a good selection of beer both on tap & in bottles. The prices are pretty on par with any bar/restaurant located on Tryon in Charlotte, so I can't really complain here. They also have a couple pool tables, and a lounge upstairs if you want to get out of the main bar scene.\n\nFox & Hound won't blow you away with anything, especially if you're there to watch a game. It always seems to be packed so there must be something that keeps bringing people back again & again. Check it out & you may actually like it better than me if you don't like the loud sports crowd but still want to watch the game."
2,"I've had good times at Ri-Ra, and I've had some bad times.\nMost of the good times were due to the band playing, which is sometimes really good, and most of the bad times were a combination of bad music and overcrowding.\n\nThis place has been a popular mainstay of downtown/uptown as long as I can remember. \nIt's tall and long inside but very narrow, and when its crowded it can offer up a bit of a claustrophobic vibe.\n\nSince its so popular, it can draw a bit of an unruly, late-night crowd as well. Most of the people here are cool however, and the staff seem to be nice and accommodating. \n\nStill, its hard to get a beer or drink, and I usually don't spend more than an hour or two here before bailing for more comfortable confines.\n\nI can't speak to the food, as I've never eaten here. I have seen a menu though, and it looks decent, and decently priced."
2,"So on day two of my retreat in Charlotte, the ladies planned dinner at Ri Ra. I'd never eaten at an Irish restaurant, so I was excited. I was even more excited to see our amazingly hot waiter with his amazingly awesome Irish accent (so authentic!). \nThe ambience was sorta cool, with this totally traditional vibe to it. Granted we were an extremely large group, but the customer service sorta sucked (the server to our side of the table forgot my sweet potato fries and wanted to bring them out as I was finishing my food). I ordered the pulled pork sliders, and those were pretty good, as was the side of potato salad that came with it. I just wish my fries had come out as well, because they looked amazing on someone else's plate... \nohhhhh welll... guess i'll have to go back again next time!"
3,Authentic Irish feel with a friendly staff and warm atmosphere. Expected selection of draft beers for an Irish Pub. Good selection of bottled beers.
1,"Came here with a friend for lunch and sat on the roof top deck. Aces for that! We started with the fried pickle. Love FP, but these were a poor representation of them. Greasy and the batter was peeling off. I had the brisket with sweet potato, oh! That's right. I didn't get what I ordered. I over cooked greasy fries like everyone else. The brisket was very good thought. It had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it. The meat was a bit over cooked. It was a beautiful day to hand with friends on the sunny deck!"
3,"Ri Ra's is a good ol' fashioned Irish Pub. The most noticeable difference between it and a pub in Ireland is that it is a lot bigger than a pub in Ireland, though it's still a lot smaller than your average restaurant.\n\nThe food and atmosphere are amazing. They have the best shepherd's pie I've ever had, bar none. Their soda bread, while not traditional, is very good and is a perfect compliment to their OUTSTANDING potato and leek soup. It's the perfect thing to warm your insides on a blustery evening. The burgers are just okay. The decor is great, with the heavy wooden tables and stone fireplaces, it feels like a real, rustic pub.  The prices are a few dollars more than I think is fair, thus the 4-star rating. Be sure to join their rewards club so you can get discounts and gift cards to make it more affordable.\n\nOh, and they have live music later in the evening on weekdays."
0,"Lights too low, music too loud, not many people inside, drinks too expensive. Plus it costs 5$ just to get in. Def not worth it. Try some where else!"
0,"I only gave them 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. Food was mediocre (fries were cold), and we haven't seen our waitress in 45 minutes (writing this review while waiting to ask for the check). I'll write another review tomorrow if I'm still here waiting."
1,"This is a sports bar off the lobby of the Marriott Center City in Charlotte, NC. This is not a big place, but laid out to be a sports bar with a lot of monitors. Went here a night during final four (Basket Ball). The bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive. They have a good selection of beer (however their dispenser of draft was out of service). How can you have a bar with no draft beer? I got a Sam Adams (in a bottle). Tried their Philly Cheese Steak. That is probably the worst Philly cheese steak I have had in my life (and I used to live in Philadelphia). The meat was burnt, the onions were fried beyond belief and the cheese was very greasy. The fries were OK. \n\nIn summary a great location, great server, beer so-so and food not up to par.  Sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook."
2,"not thrilling, not disappointing.  RB is average across the board.  Try the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken."
1,"The only really great thing I can say about Rock Bottom is their location, it was perfect right before going out on a Friday night, but that's it.  Their menu is WAY overpriced, with nothing really great on it.  I just got the nachos (found as an appetizer) and my friend got the burger.  The nachos were overcooked and semi-stale.  The beer was decent, it's just draft beer here.  Service was good and the atmosphere was fine.  But I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."
3,"For the most part, your average \""American food\"" type of restaurant. I can't comment on their beers as we didn't have any. The menu was pretty extensive but we'd viewed it online beforehand and knew what we wanted. Hubs got the seafood cobb salad which was HUGE and he enjoyed every last bit of it. I ordered the hazelnut crusted chicken primarily because I noticed before we went that a few reviewers here on yelp recommended it. It was reallllllly good! Also HUGE portions that hubs had to help me eat. the chicken itself was really tender and juicy and that crust and sauce are delicious. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, as you'd expect, and even the vegetables were yummy. We also had the jalapeno spinach dip which was not that great. I mean it was fine, but out of all the spinach dips I've tried in my life, it was not on the top 10. The atmosphere is nice, it's pleasantly decorated and clean, nothing special. Seems pretty large, probably good for groups. The booth we sat in was really spacious and comfortable. Our service was quick and adequate, although our specific server seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else but work that night. She wasn't rude, just did the bare minimum and spoke very quiet and without any energy. But she was quick and got our orders right, which is really what matters. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if the location and timing was just right, as it was for us last night, I would go again."
1,"Went here for a pre-show meal. We were looking forward to the beers, and fortunately or unfortunately (depending upon your viewpoint), that was the highlight of the meal. I ordered the ribs, which were dry and not that hot. Also they were not that tender. Their sweet sauce, however, was good, but no sauce can make up for poorly cooked ribs. My wife had the chicken pesto pasta. While that was decent, it wasn't exciting either.\n\nSure, the plates were \""sizeable.\"" But PRICEY for what you get. I mean, we could have gone to Aria Italian nearby and gotten a MUCH better quality of food for LESS than this place! I mean, we went here thinking we would get a good value. Unfortunately, it's more than a lot of other comparable places in Uptown.\n\nToo many other choices in Charlotte to come back here."
3,"one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \""asian\"""
3,"with a name like presto, i was expecting italian food.\n\ni stayed in charlotte, nc for a week and in a small walk from my hotel room discovered presto.  i had a garden salad which was accompanied by an entire loaf of bread on it's own mini cutting board, and the seafood jambalaya. everything was delicious. there was plenty of shrimp and large scallops in my jambalaya, the bread came with a plate of olive oil and herbs, and the salad's balsamic vinaigrette dressing wasn't too heavy.\n\nnext time i fly out to charlotte i'll most likely eat at presto again."
1,"Oh, Presto, my experience here was just - not - good.  First, my rating of 2/5 stars is based primarily on the food, not the service.  \n\nI dined with a friend on a week night.  The restaurant was pretty empty, no wait for a table.  Our server was friendly and adequate, not magnificent.\n\nI decided to give Presto a try since they had a groupon coupon a while back.  So I had some money to spend, and Iwas able to taste quite a few dishes.  We started off with two appetizers: calamari and crab dip.  Calamari was very good; however, the sauce was, well, gross.  It was overly sweet and had an odd flavor.  We just ignored this and ate the calamari, as is.  The crab dip was another disappointment.  We were given plenty of chips, way more than we had dip for, which is never a great sign.  The cheese had a Velveeta consistency which I absolutely despise!  The cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor.  Toward the bottom there were whole chunks of crab...and you guessed it...now without any cheese!  \n\nI ordered the lasagna which came with a salad.  I ordered the Caesar salad.  Wow, this was just embarrassing (for them).  It was literally chopped Romaine with bottled dressing (I'd bet all my money - Ken's Steakhouse non-creamy kind).  I had about 4 bites and just put it aside.\n\nThe lasagna.  Well, remember that sauce with the calamari?  That's what is in the lasagna!  I actually had to send the dish back.  I was so disturbed by this sauce that I HAD to ask what was in it.  Well, tell me what you think - tomato sauce with cinnamon, and brown sugar.  \n\nI traded it in for a sandwich.  I just didn't know what to do.  I got a veggie sandwich with fries.  As a PS - bread was over saturated with oil but veggies tasted good.  Fries were under seasoned.  \n\nNot going back, but I think this place may be better as a lunch destination."
2,"This place seems to be going a tad downhill. Super disappointed that the drink specials went up. The waiter was super nice, but the service was slow. If you do go, then sit downstairs...it seems that they had better service. Well drinks on Fridays are $5.00 and not worth it. Pizza was decent and the spinach artichoke dip was pretty awesome."
2,Ok but not fabulous-decor in room was bland.  Quiet with all the things a business traveler could want including business center where you can print out your boarding pass for free.  Great view of uptown and very comfortable beds.
0,You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.\n\nWant a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  \n\nI will NEVER be back.
2,"As an avid book reader (more like book inhaler!) I love the Charlotte library system but I sure don't love this location. Yes, they have a larger selection than any of the regional branches. Yes, they have more (and perhaps better trained) staff than the regional branches. And yes, they have more computers than the regional branches.\n\nBut wow, do they have a completely different customer demographic. How many libraries do you know that have a security office? And the stalls in the men's room have doors that are barely half-height?\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, then sure, stop in. But I wouldn't recommend making a special trip. You'll have a much better experience at almost any of the regional branches.\n\nNote - there is a drive-up book drop in the back."
3,"Considering I'm staying at the Hilton this week and working at the AT&T building next door, the Coffee Station is the closest java joint to get my caffeine fix in the morning and during the 2 to 3 PM lull.\n\nI must say that the several times I've been here so far, service has been incredibly friendly and they make tasty coffee.   I just had their breakfast sandwich and a large coffee this morning and the total for both was under 4 bucks.   Wow, really?   All I get for that at Starbucks is a lame scone.   And service here was far superior to the service I get at Starbucks.   The only thing I'll give Starbucks over Coffee Station is the quality of the coffee.     Still, me like very much."
0,All I can say is that A) I had no other option then to go with Time Warner Cable for my internet service \n\nand B....\n\nIf you don't have a local number it will be an absolute NIGHTMARE to pay your bill! You can go through the ring of automated messages only to get to a live person (after 10-15 min) then be told they will charge you so you must go through the automated service ....(repeat ). I cringe when it comes time to pay my bill each month.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to avoid using them -I suggest you do so !
1,"In my area, I have my choice of Time Warner, Windstream & DirectTV. I went with Time Warner many years ago because of the fabulous bundle pricing (basic cable DVR & high speed internet, only). Unfortunately, like almost everything else, they reward you so well as a new customer, but do not offer anything for loyalty.\n\nI've been with them almost 6 years & the first few years were fine.  I was happy with a below $100 bill every month & never had any outages.  Fast forward to the past couple of years & I've had outages out of the blue, significant rate increases, locked into two different year contracts, only to have my bill stand at a whopping $141 every month.  When calling to report outages / issues, I get the run around & a \""few days out\"" scheduled appointment.  As far as trying to get a better deal on my service...I'm always told, \""there aren't any promotions available to you right now\"".\n\nBuyer's remorse? You bet."
0,"TWC IS THE WORST!\n\nUnfortunately, TWC has basically monopolized the Charlotte area.  I am very jealous of all the people who have AT&T Uverse available to them.  I have contemplated DirectTV because TWC is so awful.  Every few months the \""promotion\"" on my plan runs out and when I call they say they are giving me the best possible promotion that they usually don't give to any other customer by taking $5 off...how generous.  They really don't care if their customers are unhappy because they know they have no other choice for digital TV.  If you have other options, USE THEM!"
0,"Some of the worst service ever.  I called to cancel service and was transferred to retension.  After 53 minutes on the phone and trying to cancel service, I somehow agreed to keep the service for 6 months at a significantly reduced rate.  I then recieved  the bill the next month and the price had no change.  I called and they wrote in there notes some  othert agreement.  I asked to speak to manager and they denied me.  I told them I want my service canceled now and that I was not going to pay the bill.  They said no.  I asked for the manager he said no.  He then said if I ask for manager he will need to hang up.  He hung up.  His name is Jesus and will not give any other identification to me.  He is in the retention department.  If you are the manager of this employee, please review his work."
0,"After taking three afternoons off work to wait for technicians that never showed up, my internet was finally installed, at which point I was informed that even though I ordered wireless, wireless isn't available unless you pay an extra $11 monthly fee for the router. The technician (a very nice guy) advised me to purchase my own router, which I did. When I called Time Warner to register the IP, I was informed that there is a separate $7 a month fee to use your own router.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE COMPANY. I hope all the CEOs get halitosis and their wives leave them for John Mayer."
1,"I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all."
2,"A bunch of friends from out of town and I had brunch here a little while back. While the place is kinda fancy (perhaps too fancy for us, considering we had just dragged ourselves out of bed after a long night out on the town), with serious waiters and a sorta stuff ambiance, the place serves great food. Not unsurprisingly, it's kinda expensive. Now that I think of it, we were the only people eating there who were under 30, so make of that what you will. Definitely not the place for a mellow, quick meal. \n\nLike I said, the food is great. I had a great benedict with coffee and cranberry juice. My friend has french-style pancakes, which he said were amazing. Worked for us. \n\nGrab a nice Bloody Mary here and then head out to enjoy a Sunday downtown. Good plan."
1,A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   \n\nI had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch.
3,"After having an awful, overpriced breakfast at the Courtyard Marriott - Charlotte City Center the morning before, I consulted Yelp to find a place within walking distance that wouldn't give me indigestion.\n\nI recommend the eggs benedict at the Monticell ($9). The eggs were poached perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was nicely seasoned and the cheese grits were a tasty side.\n\nThe service could have been a bit more attentive, and it's not cheap, but I would recommend the Monticello to anyone looking for a good breakfast in this part of Charlotte."
2,"I had always heard good things about Mert's and was pleasantly surprised to see that they opened up at 9 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch when most Charlotte restaurants don't open for brunch until 10 a.m.  I figured brunch would be a good introduction to Mert's and also allow us to try another brunch place that opened earlier.\n\nWe were seated and received excellent service from our server.  Unfortunately, the brunch/breakfast options seemed very limited and their taste was just average.  We crossed Mert's off our list as a feasible brunch option II wouldn't recommend it for this time of day) but may return to give their lunch or dinner a try.  I do love a good fried catfish!"
2,"I had a very nice brunch here the other day on a weekend trip to Charlotte. The food was very good but the service was ehh. The interior was interesting. I could have easily been in an Ikea on LSD. \n\nWe ordered eggs over easy with country ham, grits and a biscuit. As well as a bunch of sides (mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, catfish, cornbread). The country ham was wayyy too salty but mix it up with the grits and you're back in business. Things that were excellent: the cornbread, the biscuit, and the mashed potatoes. The catfish was ok, it didn't really taste like anything but frying oil. \n\nThe service was pretty weak. Our waitress forgot to put our side order of catfish in...I know it sounds absurd.. who orders a side of catfish? Anyway, she forgot it and brought us a full catfish meal at the end of our meal which we didn't turn away 'cause it just wasn't worth the trouble. And to top it off she added an extra omelet to our bill. I usually don't check each line item on my bill but I could tell the waitress was a bit of a basket case and was right. \n\nI'll be back here the next time I'm in Charlotte."
2,"Hit up merts for dinner last night..  Had the Fried catfish and Beef rib combo.  Whole fried catfish was a little tough to negociate the bones and didnt not yeald much fish. \""The beef rib\"" was chopped up and in a small pile bones and all.  Like other have said the goodness in in the sides..  Mac and Cheese was real and had a nice crust on the top and the corn bread was good.. athough the piece my wife got looked like it was in the oven a littlel too long and dried out a bit.  Overall decent stop"
3,"Mamma better slap me, because I just sinned... \n\nLet me explain, I just got spoiled, I was rewarded with delicious food, and I didn't do anything to deserve it.  You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  \n\nFirst let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. \n\nLet's break down the meal.\n\nFried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. \n\nCollard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.\n\nMac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. \n\nHere we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!\n\nWhat in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.\n\nHere's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  \n\nLike many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food. Location isn't easy to find at first, but you want food, and you are in downtown, make this a perfect spot, for you and all your friends."
2,"Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \n\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal."
1,"The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again."
3,"I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat."
4,"Promised myself in the breakfast review I wrote in early July that I would go back for lunch.  Check!  Been twice for lunch now and each time walked away fully, full and happy.\n\nFirst trip brought fried catfish, candied yams and a small salad with blue cheese dressing.  The catfish is fried whole and comes with some spicy, mayo-based sauce on the side.  Splash on some hot sauce and a squeeze of lemon and you get, YUM!  The sides were good as well.\n\nSecond visit, I went with the lunch special of the day, beef liver and onions.  OK, I know some of you just went, \""GROSS\""!  Don't be haters!  Liver is delicious, especially when it's prepared like this.  Slight char on it and covered in a great tasting   brown onion gravy. Tried the mac n cheese this time and it made me smile also.  They also bring a small individual loaf of cornbread and honey butter with lunch orders.  It is moist and flavorful and is a great add to the meal.\n\nService was fast and friendly on both lunch visits just like at breakfast.  Thankfully I work at the Southern end of Tryon and Mert's is towards the Northern end, just across from the Hearst Tower on College St.  Let's just say, I need that longish walk back to cubeville after a big, delicious lunch like this..."
4,"Thank you Yelp!  We were in town visiting and decided to try this place for lunch based on its good reviews.  Yelpers were right on - delicious (and affordable)!  We loved the cornbread, candied yams, collard greens, carolina chopped bbq, mac & cheese, green beans, and black eyed peas.  Generous portions too.  Full of atmosphere and it was still busy at 3pm.  \n\nWe definitely recommend Mert's."
3,"My friend and I were driving from DC and finally made it to Charlotte. We've never been to Charlotte, North Carolina and was craving some serious Southern food. We came in and it was really busy. I ordered the fried chicken breast with sides of collard greens and mac and cheese and my friend ordered the Whiting poboy. The collard greens reminds me of Vietnamese mustard and greens and was so good. That is probably the best friend chicken I've ever had. The skin was flavorful and the meat was juicy and tender. Many times friend chicken comes out really dry, but not at Mert's. Of course I completed my Southern meal with some sweet tea."
1,I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.
1,"Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully, this was a one-off."
3,"Delicious Southern food!\n\nThe cornbread was so good. I got BBQ Beef Ribs, with Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens, and Yams. The ribs were full of yummy NC vinegary flavor, the mac was cheesy and good, the collard greens were tangy and flavorful, and the yams were savory and sweet. For my first dinner in Charlotte, I was def satisfied.\n\nPrices are decent, and the service is good.\n\nParking can be a little tough. My best suggestion would be to park in one of the nearby structures, bc there really isn't street parking."
2,"Another big soul food spot downtown. If you are looking for chicken, ribs, and other down south delights you are in the right place. The restaurant Is on the small side so there is usually await. But the cornbread is defiantly worth the wait outside if the door. I usually get the fried chicken wings and Mac and cheese.\n\nGood spot to grab dinner, casual, will fill you up."
1,"Not the best soul good I've ever eaten. My collard greens mixed with mustards? Were tough. The fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about. Salmon cakes were good. Mac n cheese can pass for soul food. Yams were great! Corn bread mediocre, overall it was okay. Don't believe the hype, especially if you were brought up on Mamas soul food cooking."
2,"So it took three trips but I think I'm finally starting to become a fan of Merts.\n\nMy first visit was to pick up some catering for an event and I didn't get a chance to try anything. The second visit was a bust I ordered the chicken wings, cabbage and seasoned rice. Meh, I've had better everything. The chicken wings were just okay, and the cabbage and rice didn't have enough seasoning for my tastes. \n\nBut this last visit was much better. \n\n\nWe started with the Soul Rolls which come stuffed with chicken, rice, greens and black eye peas. They come topped with a spicy honey mustard sauce and were very good. They were crispy and packed with the filling. I'd recommend them. They also bring out some cornbread and that was definitely a highlight for me! It was warm and with some butter....it practically melts in your mouth. \n\nFor my meal I had the pork chops, macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. I was impressed with the amount of food you get! Two juicy and well seasoned (yay!) pork chops blackened with delicious seasoning. Very good. For me, the sides were just okay again. I'm not sure what to get that will give me that \""amazing\"" feel but I guess I'll keep trying....\n\nI couldn't leave without trying some dessert so I ordered the strawberry cake. It was very very moist and delicious. \n\nSo overall a much better visit this go round...I'll make my way back and give this place another try to see if they can officially win me over."
2,"Only went there during happy hour. There was a great drink selection, but it was so crowded the service was not great."
2,"Disappointing. My wife and I came here to celebrate her birthday, but the slow and unresponsive service negated the romantic ambiance and decent meal. Considering how empty the restaurant was the night we were there, it shouldn't have taken 20 minutes for us to get a plate of bread and 2 glasses of water. \n\nThe food was good, but not particularly memorable. While we enjoyed the Lobster Mac n' Cheese, the scallops I ordered for a main course were bland, and my wife was equally unimpressed with her chicken dish. When time came to order coffee and dessert, we headed up the street to the Capitol Grille. \n\nMimosa Grill boasts a great Uptown location and an elegant atmosphere. But with the wide selection of outstanding dining options in Charlotte, I wasn't sufficiently impressed to go back."
4,I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!
0,"This place is a craphole. My friends and I have gone for a 2 AM breakfast a couple of times (I know that seems weird but it's cheaper than eating at the diner that caters the breakfast!) and the people working there are absolute dicks. The girl at the front door acts like she's the hottest thing since sliced bread. The girls that walk around are bit*hes unless you're throwing wads of money out. I jokingly told one of the girls that my friend wanted a lap dance and within 5 minutes he came back really mad. He said she danced and he handed her $30 and she said \""NO! It's $60!\""  That's crazy considering the girls don't even look very good! Maybe I'm biased because I'm not a strip club kind of guy but this place is a bad way to end a good night"
1,Even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad. I've eaten here and at the one in South End and both are a waste.  I usually just eat at the Pita Pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendors(the chicken on a stick is might damn good!) by The Forum.
1,"Pizza is like art. Your dough acts as a canvas and your tomato sauce is like the paint... ok, I know, cut the crap. It's just pizza.\n\nMy mom came to visit this weekend and we found ourselves at the door of Fuel - the neon sign beckoning us in - so we accepted the invitation. First impression: Truck stop? Where is the gasoline smell? I mean, if they want to go all the way authentic they should just put in a gas pump. Heck, that would draw in plenty of people!\nWe were the first ones there.. which was good because about 3 minutes later the line was out the door, literally. We each got a slice. I kept it plain, what can I say.. I'm a pizza minimalist. You can really tell a lot about a pizza place by the way a slice of cheese pizza tastes.. and this is.. average. Although I do love the thin crust I'm lost with the amount of grease. The sauce is good, not to sweet, but the cheese is sparse and knowing what you can get else ware makes it less worthwhile.\nI'd say this would be a good place to crash in a drunken stupor but for my sober days I'll head out to Rosario's in Concord. That's a real pie."
1,"The two stars are for one thing.. The SLICE.  It is a descent piece of pie that would only be completely wonderful at 3am after a long night of drinking.  Other than that, this place is grimy, creepy, and nasty.  I would suggest trying one of the other Fuels outside of the city.. Trust me.  \n\n-Ian M."
3,"Ok im not going to say that i dont love coming here. The service is great, the ambience phenomenal, the manager is actually italian, etc. I love coming here for dinners or just a bite at the bar, but like with the rest of cuisine in Charlotte, its just not awesome. I believe its because the water in CLT sucks. \n\nGrilled octopus is the best thing on the menu. Hands down"
4,"My wife and I went last night for a \""date night\"" and were very pleased. Very romantic, quiet, well-decorated. The bar was comfortable and they had a great selection and service (friendly but not too chatty). The staff was overall what really made this experience so good. Every person was friendly, knowledgable, and fun. The dinner was very good although we didn't care too much for the flash-fried calamari. \n\nWe would absolutely recommend this wonderful restaurant and will be coming back."
1,"This place is quite a paradox....\n\nYou almost have to love to hate it...\n\nWhy do I say this?\n\nThe FOOD is terrible....\nThe bread is soggy, the sandwiches uneventful..the burgers bland...and the fries are pedestrian...\n\nThe amenties are average picnic tables w/bad wood booths...\nTHe prices are high for what you get...\n\nSo why would you LOVE it?\n\nThey have some INCREDIBLY hot girls who work there...\n\nMy high school friend who's still a bachelor would LOVE\nthis place.  \n\nThese girls are all his cup of tea.\n\nALL of the girls are young, wispy, curvy and pretty...\nProbably 5'1-5'5\"" walking around in form fitting outfits\nw/long straight hair...and perfectly tanned faces w/incredible\nfeatures.\n\nNot just ONE..but ALL of them are like that.\n\nIs this where the girls who didn't make the Carolina Panther cheerleader squad work?  At least they must be the little sisters of the panther cheerleaders.\n\nYOu will see LOTS of pervy looking silver haired men in this place..pretending like they like the food..\n\nIt's too bad the girls have no idea how to be servers..\n\nI ordered a roast beef sandwich but instead of getting what I want..I was forced to get what the girl wanted me to order...it was like a jedi mind trick!\n\nMe \""I'd like a cold roast beef, w/some dip on the side\""\nHer \""So you want the au jou...\""(scolding me)\nME \""Um..not really..I wanted the vegetables on the cold sandwich\""\nHer \""You can get that but it's still an au jou\""\nME \""Okay...I guess?\""\nHer \""Yes..so you are getting the au jou\""\n\nSO she gives me the roast beef Au Jou and of course\nI got no lettuce tomatoes etc as I requested.\nI didn't even want to bother to correct her..\n\nI could tell it wasn't getting through.\n\nJust stand there honey..in your skin tight leggings, ugg boots\nand form fitted sweater and smile.\n\nThat's why guys spend 10-20 dollars in here.\n\nAt least this isn't frowned upon like it is in California and is actually CELEBRATED here in Charlotte.\n\nPretty girl who can't do much..serving you bad food!"
2,"I headed over to here after roller derby shenanigans one Thursday night. Thursdays at Hartigans are karaoke night so I was kept pretty entertained.\n\nThe interior is nice-- almost sport-bar-y by feel rather than a pub. Brightly lit, and more tables and bar seats than booths. \n\nThe bartender wasn't exactly rude to me, but not particularly nice either.\n\nI snacked on some fries while I was there- pretty subpar. The beer selection was mediocre and definitely a pinch more pricey than the quality I got.\n\nOne great thing though, I have to mention, about this place is it is GLBT friendly and not flamboyant about it. In the south, that isn't as common so yeah. Props for that."
1,"Strange little place hidden on 5th St. in uptown that for some reason stays packed. Of course, it's not really hard to pack this place, as small as it is. It does seem to be popular though, probably mainly due to the scenery of the bartenders. \n\nUnfortunately, you only get a glimpse of them as you grab a drink and try to stay out of the crush. And good luck getting back to your group or your table without spilling half of your drink, if you are lucky enough to find a place to sit.\n\nLive bands and, more often, DJs are in there spinning some decent tunes, but Phil's is more often a staging point for the rest of the evening, a springboard to bigger places and better things."
1,"I'm writing this review as I sit in the Hilton Garden Inn at Charlotte.\n\nThe rooms are adequate, with most coming with a flat screen television or two, comfortable beds, and ample showers or hot tub jacuzzis. There is also a full service restaurant and bar in the Lounge area of the Hotel.\n\nI will also give them a nod for their complimentary shuttle which will travel you anywhere in a three mile radius of the hotel. The dude driving the shuttle was very polite and curtious ... I'm guessing because he didn't have to stay or work in the Hotel itself.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.\n\nThe gym facilities are atrocious. 2 Treadmills, a recumbant bike, and an Elliptical machine with maybe 4 medicine balls littered around a room that measures 6 ft x 20ft, if that. A grotesque pool with a grimey bottom that on more than one occasion I considered drowning myself in to free myself from my mortal shackles and break free from this prison of a hotel.\n\nConcierge wasn't helpful at all -- when I arrived at the front desk and asked if I could score a bottle of water to use the gym, because I didn't feel like paying the $4.00 fee for drinking the Fiji water they had in my room, the guy at the front desk stuck up his nose and snootily informed me \""You can purchase water from the gift shop.\"" Sorry buddy, at over $150 bucks per night, you can *give* me a water for the cost of... free. Also, what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift?\n\nThe in House internet is the slowest you will find. I'm a computer / IT guy myself and it is flagrantly apparent that this place throttles their bandwidth usage. Online Games of any type slow to a crawl, and streaming video sites such as Hulu or YouTube take forever and a day to load. This is the year 2010 -- we should have hover cars by now, but apparently its too much to ask for a sad excuse for a Hilton to manage their Internet Connection enough to let me watch the Keyboard Cat before dying of boredom.\n\nThe location is also horrible. Right next to the Nascar Hall of Fame ... and thats about it. Everywhere you'd want to go is located 1/2 mile or so into the city, so you have to take the shuttle to get anywhere. Without the shuttle, this place would be unstayable.\n\nAlright / Mediocre Rooms + Satisfactory Shuttle Service + Snooty Concierge + Horrible Gym Facilities + Atrocious Location = Don't waste your time. I saw a park bench a few blocks away that I will be living under during my next stay in Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and visit the aLoft at the Epicenter -- it beats this place in every measurable way."
4,"Until Del Frisco showed up, best steak and best wine list in town!!!  Now...it's a toss up.  Wait staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly.  Go light on the app's, everyone...the steaks are ridiculously large.  They've got one of those wine lists that is made for every single person that can walk through that door...great whites and great reds...excellence whether you're staying under 20 bucks, or if you're budget is big time.  Also, the bar out front is a great place to enjoy some happy hour and watch the cougars on the prowl...fun people watching."
4,"This is the classic Capital Grille experience.  And that is a classy, high-end one at that.\n\nThe product here is very similar to other Capital Grille's, so I will not go into detail.  The point I was wanting to make here is that I happened to be out with a co-worker who is a very experienced bar man who's also a bit of a foodie and really enjoys a good restaurant.  So, being a classy place, he started ordering some really traditional drinks that you just don't hear of much these days.  The bartender at this Capital Grille was definitely up to the measure required for CG staff and the high-end product they deliver.\n\nA couple drinks we had made are a Baby Guiness (which I had never heard of myself).  Barman knew exactly what to do, even the pour over the back of a spoon.  Another was Sambuca, which was expertly paired with 3 coffee beans.  The guy knew what he was doing.  And it was done smartly.\n\nCapital Grille - always a good fine dining experience."
2,"Took two colleagues from work here for a belated, \""thanks for all you did in 2011\"", lunch. I have never been to this location for dinner but had a kick butt good dinner at a Houston location a couple years ago so the lunch expectations were high. \n\nThe service was quite good but the food was just good which is not good enough at these prices. And yes, you are allowed to say \""these prices\"" even at lunch at a place like CG. \n\nHITS - Wedge salad. Very yummy blue cheese dressing, quality bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato and as big as your head. The hot, fresh bread and cold butter. \nAVERAGE - Clam chowder. It had good flavor and a respectable amount of clams but way too many potatoes and was luke warm. \nMISSES - Chefs burger. Ordered medium rare, served medium well and had barely any flavor to it. \n\nBack to Ruth's Chris for next years thank you lunch..."
3,"I'll be honest- we only ate here because we were given a $100 gift card. This made a ridiculously expensive restaurant cost about as much as it would cost us on an average night out. We skipped drinks and dessert (we were really too full of other stuff anyway!) and our bill still came to $114 before tip. I was surprised that the dress code was so casual for such a nice place; my husband and I dressed up (hey, it's not every day that we eat so fancy!) but we saw folks there in shorts and flip flops, too.\n\nWe started with the delicious bread, and calamari. The calamari was spicy, and it would have been better with some sort of dipping sauce, but I guess that isn't classy enough for the Capital Grille! I just squeezed lemon juice all over my plate and it was delicious.\n\nI ordered the citrus-glazed salmon for my entree, with a spinach salad and warm bacon dressing on the side. The salmon was a very generous portion that was very well done. I'm very picky when it comes to salmon and I found this to be fresh and delicious. The salmon also came resting on a generous bed of asparagus, onions, etc. which was an unexpected surprise as we'd been told that all sides were a la carte. I definitely could have skipped the spinach salad, just because I already had so much food and we were staying in a hotel without a mini fridge. But the salad itself was delicious- more of a dinner portion than a side, actually.\n\nMy husband ordered the steak and lobster. At $49 it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, yet is was a LOT smaller than my salmon (which was $33). He was disappointed at the size for that price, actually. But it still managed to be large enough that he couldn't finish it, with the bread and calamari he'd already eaten. The steak and lobster were both delicious, though.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Our server, Denise, was friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend the Capital Grille for anyone looking for a nice steak or seafood dinner."
1,"The ambiance is deliciously dark and a throwback to the grand old days of quality tablecloths and real silverware.\nThe service here was very sub-par.  Perhaps that was because I was dressed like an ignorant tourist that just wanted to be comfortable checking out the city---FYI--tourists have money to spend, too...\nI hate the fact that most upscale steak restaurants ignores the needs of patrons who want to watch their waistline.\nMy husband likes steak, BUT--- I want to eat healthy.  So, how about some healthy options, Capital?  \nI had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk. There entree-sized salad was fit for a mouse that had already eaten...I  left hungry! Ugh.\nPlus---my special order came out wrong and I had to (once again) watch my husband eat while I fantasized about how many carbs were in the napkin...\nOh, I won't be coming back.  There are too many other great places to spend my well-earned money on."
2,"Wen't to Capital Grille for my birthday dinner. I hadn't been here since I was in High School. From what I remembered it was really good. Of course everything is a la carte. I ended up only having Lobster Mac and Cheese. (I'd already had a recovery meal after party #1) It was okay. Could have used a boost in flavor somewhere. Maybe some salt. My biggest concern was my drink. Is that bad? I'm concerned with my drink. Anyway, I ordered a Sidecar. It came in a goblet style glass full of ice. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Are Sidecars not to be served up? With actual Cognac? I figured Capital would know better than that. Other than that my large group was served well. They even threw some berries on a platter with my cake that my friends brought. Nice touch. Oh, and we saw celebrities, like face to face. Thank goodness CIAA will be back for six more years!!"
4,The steak was cooked to perfection  .  Staff  is very friendly. Nice place to hang out.
4,"This the most ultramodern, upscale place I've been to in a long time.  This little place is tucked away inside the Marriott City Center and is a really treat to go to.  Very high class, boldly decorated and has some awesome food.  It's expensive (as you would expect) but it's worth it. The veal was a mouthwatering experience to say the least.  The servers were very impressive, they were very attentive and you could tell they really wanted us to have a good experience.  But the best part of the meal is always the dessert and I have four words for you, Krispy Kreme bread pudding.  That is all."
4,"Must say that Bulleit Burbon is very hard to find and this place had it.  SCORE!! Dark leather, dark wood, great conversation areas, lots of cigar smoke and great service.  Didn't have to buy a cigar, the place was a blue-grey haze of smoke.   \n\nKind of wonky getting into the place.  It's not really in the hotel but it is.  You have to walk in the breezeway before the lobby.  Door is a bit unexpected, but not hidden.  Not their fault, but in a sense it adds to the ambiance."
2,"Went to my first Panthers' game the other day; real good time, actually, even though I couldn't care less about the Panthers. It seems I'm the only one who doesn't: the place was, to my surprise, absolutely packed with Panther's fans. Pretty good for a team that's only been around for, what, ten years?\n\nOn game day, the stadium is absolutely surrounded and consumed by tailgating fans; during the rest of the week, it stands there, right outside of downtown, quiet and lonely looking. I guess that can be said of a lot of stadiums, though. \n\nAs for the place itself, really good facilities and pretty good crappy stadium food--hotdogs, pretzels, beers, that kinda stuff. But it actually wasn't as expensive as I'd feared. Pretty reasonable, in fact, which is a rarity. \n\nAnd the fans were well-behaved and fun. Definitely a nice, family-friendly atmosphere. And there are always tickets available, so check it out."
3,"There is not a bad seat in this house for a football game.  Seriously!  We had our backs against the wall in the \""nosebleeds\"" to see the Panthers vs Saints December 2013, and had a GREAT time with a wonderful view!  If you think it might rain, bring a poncho; if you think it'll be cold, bring a coat!  Employ common sense, and you'll have a blast!\n\nTHAT BEING SAID... the concession workers STINK on an alarming level.  By and large it takes almost a HALF HOUR to get a drink of ANY sort.  I stood in line for 20 minutes (ALL OF HALFTIME AND THEN SOME) for a diet pepsi... the workers are worse than slow... actually, city workers could give them some tips on efficiency... it's THAT bad if you're not in club-level seating.  My advice?  Eat before you arrive, arrive early, order your drinks, get cozy in your seats, and enjoy the game! :)"
0,"Bland franchise with a terrible uni color scheme and brutal logo. Other than the one season Jake Delhomme did not play like the mediocre QB he is, that's it. I defy anyone outside of Carolina to name a player on the Panthers. Julius Peppers does not count as he just left.\n\nI do love one thing; Coach Fox likes to call the onside kick at the most unlikely times and they often work."
2,"They always get so out of breath, this team. Hence their name: Carolina Panters.\n\nI'm no fan of the Carolina Panthers. Cam Newton is pretty cool, so was Steve Smith, but yeah. And Peppers. He was good.\n\nI feel bad that you guys have to go with the name Carolina. It always makes me feel like it's a real diss to Charlotte. I could understand it with New England playing so far outside Boston, and wanting to draw in the rest of the states in the region. And Boston is so famous already for all of its other teams and things that it doesn't need the Patriot name. But you would be surprised how many people outside Carolina don't even know which city the Panthers play in. \""Charlotte could have an NFL team right?\"" said a friend of mine. \""That's a big city isn't it?\""\n\nAnyway, I'm more of a Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill person than a Charlotte person anyway, but more power to the Panthers and good luck to them in all their future ventures.\n\nI just wish they didn't always sound so out of breath."
2,"I really like the atmosphere of this pub when we first went there.  I liked how small and intimate it was.  I like dark, candle lit bars.  It just makes me feel a little more cozy. Unfortunately, the service was a bit lacking.  It took about 10 minutes to get a beer (on several occasions) when there was hardly anyone there, and they charged us twice for 2 single Jameson's. We didn't catch this until we had gotten home. It's not that big of a deal, but considering we went on a night when it wasn't that busy, you think they would be paying more attention to what was going on in front of the bar (i.e. people waiting for drinks) and behind the bar (i.e. getting someone's tab right) I have a feeling we'll be going back. It was a great time regardless, but I guess there are some things that just leave a bad taste in your mouth.  We'll be going back though. ;)"
4,"A well kept secret! If you are looking for wine treats, you have to check this out. It is like a little wine store located right inside the department store. They do tastings and classes and have a special room for the fine stuff.. I have only just peeked through the glass, but YUM!"
3,Great Turkey Grinder!
3,"The Arthur's menu offers a wide variety of options, including burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soup, salad, & grinders...plus wine desserts & other treats.\nA great spot found in Southpark Mall, to avoid the food court and maybe select something a little healthier."
1,"BlackFinn is like Buckhead Lite, if that makes sense. This place is literally like stepping into a good ol' boy frat house, maybe at Clemson or UNC. But as I've previously stated, this doesn't mean that the place isn't fun. It just means that you should know what you're getting yourself into when you head over there. Not a place to go for a casual drink, unless you're going midday or on a quieter night early in the week. \n\nLots of TVs in this huge bar, so it's a pretty decent place to watch a football or basketball game, especially since a lot of fans turn out here to check out their team. Located literally across the street from the Arena, it gets pretty packed before or after Bobcats games/concerts. It gets especially nuts on Friday and Saturdays, so be warned (or advised, if that's what you're looking to get into). \n\nThere's always a cover, which is a pain in the butt, but it's generally a good time if you're looking to really tie one on with friends."
2,"It's definately meat-markety as previously stated. It's a place you gotta wanna go. If you're lookin for a relaxing evening then don't go here- simple as that. If you feel like taking a stranger home - this is a prime destination. Everyone is beyond trashed, normally. And o-yea, the more clevage you show the quicker you'll get your drink. Hey, I'm not opposed to using womenly wiles. \n\nI wasn't terribly impressed by the music but then again I rarely listen to the radio anymore. Anyhow! Huge space, sticky floors, gross bathrooms, and lots of horny people ..... sometimes you just want that."
3,"I am not sure why SF folks have a problem with Charlotte restaurants but maybe they should give Zebra's, Barrington's, Bonterro or Nobles a try prior to giving up on Charlotte.\nLavecchia's is a bit noisy once it gets crowded but the seafood is pretty good (yes Upstream is better, but a bit new something for my taste). Try the their version of  Oysters Rockefeller  (not authentic but very tasty). Plus they have free parking in the building."
1,"I sat at the bar to try out Lavecchia's during Queen's Feast, Charlotte's Restaurant Week, fixed price 3-course menu. The atmosphere was nice & attentive. I didn't see the hostesses smiled once during the meal. Not sure what's up with that. I ordered the loster bisque, grilled Atlantic salmon & chocolate layer cake. The bisque was lukewarm at best. The salmon was tasty & the only redeeming part of the meal. The chocolate cake was cold & hard. If this place is deciding to dog it for what is supposed to be a showcase week for restaurants that's pathetic. If that's just how it is here then that's bad given their price points. Either way, I won't be coming back."
3,"This place is a cool place in Charlotte.  They have Salsa dancing on Thursdays that can get pretty busy.\n\nI usually come here midweek, but hear that  weekends are fun too.  The bald headed bartender was very friendly and knowledgable.  The IPA I had was really good (but just a tad warm).  I am staying at the Holiday Inn across the street so this is a good low-key find right next to my hotel.   Was described as a Bank Of America bar and not a Wachovia Bar, I guess the two of them compete in this town?!?!.........Kidding.  Have fun."
2,Drink prices are high but the dancing is fun!
0,"The bartenders are friendly and the drink selection is creative, such as the Long Island Mr. Iced T.  How cool is that?!\n\nBut this place is a hellhole for people who really like to dance without getting blind wasted.  There is no designated dance area and the place is fairly large, so you end up with a bunch of people milling about, beers in hand.   I have never seen so many people so slovenly drunk bumping into you or spilling their drink on you.  It's like dancing in a barn with all the animals running loose.   It's probably the gothiest place in town and I really wanted to like it place but all three times I've been I spent more effort trying to control my violent tendencies than having fun dancing.\n\nAnd the DJ is overkill.  Three screens show movies and videos which is fine.  But it gets really annoying with the DJ calling out the names of every band and song. Perhaps he thinks you were too drunk to remember or too young to have lived it.  We all know these songs by heart, it's totally cliche and they're not teaching us anything new.  The DJ just likes being the center of attention which provides an abhorrent atmosphere.  \n\nThey also completely mash songs together, sometimes running over the best parts of the end or even the middle of a song with the beginning of another.  They do not watch the dance floor which is DJ Lesson #1.  If a good thing is already happening on the dance floor, don't mess it up.  I heard three crashes in a row on the dance floor one night and the entire crowd just stops moving.  It makes it a memorable night.  But not in a good way.\n\nPS: Whatever happened to the \""no bottles or glassware on the dance floor\"" rule?  I guess they only enforce that at \""classy\"" establishments."
3,"I vacillated between 3 and 4 stars for the Breakfast Club...but, ultimately, is you're having a) bachelorette bar crawl, b) an '80s night of any kind or c) it's super late and you're jonesin' for some Michael Jackson tunes...Breakfast Club nicely fills the void. \n\nI don't go clubbing. I really don't. Because my alcohol tolerance is (now) that of a 65 year old, sometimes it's just better that I have a drink or two and get home by midnight. Therefore, I'm not going to compare Breakfast Club to any other club in CLT. Plus, it would be unfair. \n\nThe pros: Fantastic '80s music and videos. Plenty of space to dance. The venue is incredibly unique, kitsch-ly decorated and BIG. A really great place to bring a bunch of guys or girls and celebrate a fun decade. \n\nThe cons: Some other guests can be overly drunk and, therefore, douchy. Drinks are expensive for what they are. I recall paying $8 for the tiniest of tiny rail vodka soda. The cover can be high. \n\nIf you're bopping around the Charlotte club scene, bar scene or you're just looking to try something different, Breakfast Club is a must visit...even if just once per year!"
1,"I really want to like this place because it is right across the street from where I work and we really have no other lunch options that are very close by.  However, it is very incosistent.  The past 3 times I have gone for lunch they have been out of something for the chicken cesear salad, but have not told me until I receive my order.  The first time they were out of parmesean cheese, the second time they were out of the usual sliced white meat chicken and replaced it with what appeared to be shredded leg meat and finally today they only had half a small to go cup of dressing.  All three of these items seem to be very important to making a salad that only has 4 ingredients.  If I would have known this upfront I would not order the cesear salad.  I guess I should always ask before I order to ensure that they have all of the ingredients.  In addition, it seems a little pricey for what they offer.  I can pay $9 and get a better salad at many other places uptown, I guess they are able to charge for convienence."
3,"this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died."
2,"Trendy-looking on the inside, which immediately ups the cool factor.  An ex-boyfriend took me here on a date and we enjoyed it.  I liked all the food we had except the foie gras; not necessarily the restaurant's fault, I just didn't like the texture.  I didn't want it, but Brian let me have a bite.  The wine sampler with dessert was a lot of fun.  The service was great....I'm just not sure it was worth the price."
1,"I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. \n\nThey are known for their southern, Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical, heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually, but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it, but it wasn't for me. \n\nIt gets pretty crowded during lunch hours, and the spaces are quite tight."
2,"It's a good ole southern home cooking joint on the west side. The biggest plus is the prices. Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). \n\nFood is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms), but I have found out in the 2 decades I have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful. But knowing so still doesn't stop us from wanting granny's pot roast because it is the consistency and thoughts and memories that matter.  What is off in quality at Gardenia is made up by the \""sweetie/honey\"" southern hospitality and down home appeal. \n\nIt's a solid spot for a low budget meal.  You will be happy if you have the right mindset and expectation."
3,"I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by, that's exactly what it looks like: a little shack in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. It make look a little sketch (there was some homemade BBQ for sale next to the Shack when I was here a few weekends ago), but they get the job done.\n\nI went here after a referral from a friend. I was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings. Sure enough, they had the key here. I had a new key and exchanged cash in about 5 minutes. If you have a hard to find key to duplicate - this is your spot!  Plus... one you're done you can stroll through the rest of Park Road Shopping Center if you so desire (cupcakes, coffee, Michael's, antiques, it's all here)."
3,"I went in here when I had some time to kill while a watch was being fixed, and really liked it.  The layout was a little tough to figure out at first - hard to know if a book would be in new releases, fiction, bestsellers, etc.  but the staff is very helpful.  They also have great cards, journals and other gifts.  I love that they have a big jigsaw puzzle on a table with chairs around it if you want to sit down and work on it while someone else is shopping."
1,"Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there."
2,"So I need to ask you something, Charlotte Yelpers.  \n\nForgive me because I am from out of town, and I respect you all.  But I know how serious you all take your barbecue.  During my recent trip there, I had co-workers who took me to Mac's Speed Shop for what they told me was authentic Carolina barbecue.  I loved it.  I noticed that Mac's has 3 1/2 stars currently on Yelp, same as this place.  \n\nCharllotte Yelpers, how can you tell me that this place is anywhere near as good as Mac's?  \n\nYou see, I had one day to myself to get lunch.  I decided to trust the Yelp app to find me another barbecue place.  I saw this place was near me, and having never heard of it before being from Philadelphia, I assumed this would be another authentic place.  And even though it had less reviews, I thought since it had the same level of stars as Mac's, I'd get some good barbecue that was at least as close as what they serve there. \n\nIt was about 5 minutes into sitting down here when I realized that I was sitting in the south's version of Famous Dave's.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the combo that I had.  It wasn't bad at all.  But come on.  If you want authentic barbecue, you don't come here.  I felt slightly let down.  \n\nNow that I've had my \""What the hell are you thinking Charlotte\"" rant, I'll say that for a chain restaurant, the food was pretty tasty, the service was very good, and I'd eat here again if I ever had the chance.  Both the pulled pork and the chicken were decent if not spectacular. \n\nWell, maybe I won't eat here again if I'm in the area with Mac's not too far away.  But it was good enough if not the greatest."
3,"I have to agree with Todd W. on this one...this place consistently shows \""winners\""...no joke...it seems like the majority of the movies that are shown here win some type of award! Oscars, Golden Globes etc.\n\nSo, yes, I like this theater because they show great movies and those movies tend to stick around a bit longer in the theater. The inside is nothing to really write home about - it's a bit older, but the location is super convenient to SouthPark and MP/Dilworth. Concessions are standard - expensive, yet always a necessity in my book. You'll likely pay the same prices here as you will at other theaters, but the film selection is really why you'll make the trip. \n\nI know I'll be back to Park Terrace Theaters soon...probably to see some half-indie flick that will be nominated for an Oscar!"
3,"I went with my wife a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived not knowing what we wanted to see.  Noticed that Bridesmaids was scheduled at 9:25 and decided to see it even though it was only 8:50.  We walked around a bit in the shopping center across the street, and came back.  The lady said the theater was ready yet so we sat and read for a bit until I noticed it was 9:25, so we went in to the theater only to discover the movie was playing!  but it quickly became apparent that it wasn't the beginning but  rather the end!\n\nTurns out that the sign was wrong outside (i double checked to see what it said) and that it was a 9:55 movie not 9:25.  Needless to say we were a bit annoyed to wait another half hour for the movie.  However, the manager came over and offered to refund our tickets, which I thought was a very nice gesture given the screw-up.   It definitely is a move that will make me come back again to this theater.\n\nVery cool vintage 50's facade, and an interesting mix of independent and main-stream cinema.  I like it.  And who cares about the seats anyway.  They might be old, but I was never uncomfortable."
3,Ride the Intimidator. Some say to visit the great wall of China before you die...I say tide the Intimidator.
0,"I will never go here again. Last Saturday, I paid for my ticket and headed in. Unfortunately, after waiting nearly two hours for the Nighthawk, it was put out of service, as were some others in the park that day. This has happened to me several times at Carowinds and I really don't understand how their coasters malfunction daily, sometimes multiple times. After purchasing a ticket, I literally got to ride one ride, for which I also waited over an hour. And of course their were no refunds even though it was their issue."
2,"We went this past Sun and overall had a great time. My only issue, and why I'm on Yelp, is the food. Just horrible and way, way, way overpriced.\nI would suggest spend the extra $10 for preferred parking and bring a cooler. Don't buy any food in the park. Out of desperation my sons a I had 2 slices with 2 breadsticks. Survey says-I've had MREs that tasted better.\n                              Oh yeah, $14 by the way.\nPreferred parking is only $10. Bring your own chow and have a great time."
2,"Small park, over priced food, we paid $55 for 3 slices of pizza , 2 orders of chicken wings that were the smallest flavorless wings we have ever had, and 2 beers.....never again....pack food"
2,"It's Carowinds. Some good rides. Most surrounded by stuff you won't ride or games you won't waste money on. The kids will have fun, no doubt. The people are nice enough. The group hospitality is very good with great brisket and chicken. They make you feel welcome. Just enjoy it."
0,"If you have been to Disney or even Chi-fil-a this place will disappoint you with their horrible customer service. Perhaps when 80% of your staff are 18 yrs and younger you need to instill respect, courtesy and the customer is always right b/c they just dropped a freakin mini fortune on this crappy amusement park that post hours of operations for stores and restaurants as suggested times. And you only get 1 star because I couldn't leave it blank"
0,"First off a came in and the guy didn't acknowledge me, and when he thought it was a decent time to ask me if I needed help. I told him that I called for tires cause I had a flat then, the guy said wait a minute and helped a guy who just wanted air in his tire so I waited for them to finish and he said how can I help you again and I said I would like a tire, then he asked for my keys said have. I been here before then said you can sit down now. If I wasn't form another city I wouldn't have come but I'm in a tight situation so I had to bite the bullet. Never again tho"
0,"In Oct. my son that is at  UNCC had a nail in his tire. The person at Tire Kingdom told him he needed 3 new tires., THe car is dented and has over 151,000 miles on it.We told him to match the tread. Instead of giving him options of prices they put on$ 184.00 tires EAC on the vehicle. I called very upset the next morning and the manger said he would not give me an exchange nor would he give me any money off. He offered a 4th tire with a $70.00 rebate and would discount an oil change! This is taking advantage of a young consumer and  in my opinion a terrible way of doing business. I would NEVER recommend this company."
2,"I'vs shopped at this Old Navy many times.  Prior to March 1, 2014, my shopping experiences had been pleasant.  The floor associates are very nice and really go the extra step to help customers choose the best fitting jeans.  While I have always found the floor associates helpful, the cashiers are far less pleasant.\n\nMy trip on March 1st was the most disturbing.  The store was pretty busy because of the $15 sale on jeans.  Finding a floor associate that wasn't helping another customer was impossible.  I took my purchases to the counter and asked the cashier to check the stores inventory for a size 6 pants for my little girl.  She said there were plenty on the shelf.  I told her I looked repeatedly but was not able to find a pair.  I suggested that the pants must have been on a shelf too high for me to reach.  She then asked me if I wanted to pay for my items, then go back and try to reach the pants on my own then stand in line again to complete a second transaction.  I told her I did not want to do that...that I wanted her to have an associate get the pants for me (seeing as I did not have a ladder) and ring up all my items on a single transaction.  With a very disapproving look, she said \""fine\"" and stormed off.  Very unpleasant experience.\n\nWould give five stars if not for the terrible check out service.  My latest experience was extreme but the cashiers have always been less than friendly.  I guess cashiers and floor associates receive different training.\n\nAs a side note, the tiny clearance section allows only a few shoppers at a time.  Any more than that and you could start feeling claustrophobic."
0,Crime is a problem!  I had my phone and keys stolen from me while I was in the pool at Dowd.  My babysitter had her car broken into in the Dowd parking lot as well. Both of these events took place within the last 2 months.  It is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe.
4,"First of all, this place is phenomenal.  I have a membership to the Morrison (close to work), but decided to come try out Dowd on the weekend since it's so close to my house.\n\nI walked in and asked where the cardio machines are.  The staff member behind the counter let me know that they have a few cardio machines in the Women's locker room and the rest were on the next floor.  I walked into the locker room just to check out the machines (imagining a treadmill next to the shower) and was SHOCKED.  And I really do mean I was floored.  \n\nThe Women's locker room has to be about 2,000 sq ft!  It's enormous!  There is basically a Women's gym inside the locker room!  I fell in love.  Lockers, a Jacuzzi, showers, mirrors to get ready, hair dryers, a cardio room, changing rooms, weight machines, yoga mats, a tv, and more!  Holy crap, did I just die and go too gym-heaven?!\n\nNeedless to say I didn't actually make it out of the Women's locker room to see the rest of the building.  In my defense, I didn't really need to.  They had everything I needed right there!  \n\nWhat a wonderful place!  I will definitely be back!"
3,This ymca is very large.  It has 4 floors to exercise.  Like 10 racket ball rooms.  Towel and rags are ease of access to shower and etc.  The downside is that most hours of the day it is crowded because it is located downtown.
1,Very RUDE management- we had to wait over an HOUR to get our car out of valet while we watched people leave left and right...we mentioned this to several people - we were offered many excuses to find out in the end that they completely misplaced our CAR! I would have been satisfied if they had offered us a drink- our table spent over $200 on our dinner- we didn't even get an apology...I wrote a letter and everything!\n\nThe waitstaff was friendly- the meal was ok - nothing special considering Charlotte has plenty of great restaurants . Restaurants have a lot to do with relationships- and they killed mine with this one.  Bottom line the food wasn't THAT good to warrant my return...
2,"They're trying so hard for swank. They really are. But they're failing. And it leaves me feeling blue. The bar is understaffed, they don't have a great selection, the decor is predictable (although they do have a nice set of high tables) and the lighting is a bit weird. It is a good place to have a good conversation though - just be warned, it might leave you feeling blue too."
1,"Reservation for 2 on a Saturday made with ease.  Maybe a warning sign. Valet parking was easy, as there was a basketball game, so Charlotte was busy.  The jazz ensemble was playing when we walked in.  Pretty cool - so far.  It took me a while, but I realized after a while that the inside of this place reminds me of a restaurant you would find inside of a Radisson in a medium sized city.  A restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner - and mostly from a buffet (not that there's a buffet, here) - I'm speaking about the (lack of) atmosphere.  It was also very loud.  I couldn't really hear the jazz band, just a large amount of noise.  \n\nOh, yeah, the food.  I ordered the Antipasti, and my wife ordered the Pumpkin She Crab Soup.  Those were both pretty good.  My wife ordered a glass of wine, and the pour was pretty minimal.  Look - we get it, we're not going to make the restaurants night on liquor.  I didn't order alcohol, and my wife only ordered a glass - but it was below the 1/4 full mark.  Pretty lame.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the lamb, which is a specialty, and my wife ordered the chicken stuffed with mushrooms and mascarpone.  We would never normally order chicken at a restaurant, but glad we did.  It saved the meal.  It was really good.  The lamb, however, was a stew, with veggies and such in a large pot.  It is as advertised.  It lacked a lot in the flavor department.  \n\nOne word of warning.  If you get the sea bass, it is filleted table side.  The couple (right) next to us ordered it, and it smelled, and looked kind of gross.  It kind of set me off for the rest of the meal.  \n\nDesserts were good.  I ordered the brownie topped with raspberry semifreddo, and she ordered the salted carmel pudding.  Both were OK - but not awesome.  We also had to wait for coffee.  \n\nThe service was ok, but not great.  Our waters weren't refilled but once.  \n\nI waffle between 2 stars and 3.  I think the best way to describe it is, we wouldn't go back unless some good friends really wanted to go there."
3,I went on a Saturday at lunch not very busy ... Friday I went by for lunch and it was busy with the downtown office people. Service and food was great... got the dragon and volcano rolls very good! And tasty fried dumplings... if I ever find myself in Charlotte again I will return.
3,"I've come here on and off a bunch of times over the years and never had a less than solid meal.  The food is \""b+\"" Asian cuisine and the service is always rock solid.  For a quick, tasty and convenient meal if you are nearby, this a very good choice."
2,Solid sake menu and the staff was helpful in deciding which one to go with. Sushi rolls had an interesting spin but nothing out of the ordinary.
0,"*This Review Is For The Business Office Only*\n5 weeks and one day after my wife dropped an online class, we are still fighting with CPCC to get our refund. My wife has made multiple phone calls only to have one returned. It seems her refund is setting in cyberspace. They want her to get her refund by activating a CPCC debit card, which they get a kickback on, and which is no good to use anywhere other than at CPCC.\nMy wife explained that she is almost finished with her degree and will not be attending CPCC again, therefor, does need or want a CPCC debit card, but just wants her money refunded by a check or put back on our debit card. The girl in the business was not very helpful, but kind of rude and snippy, and said she would have her supervisor call my wife, which as usual, we are still wating on a return phone call.\nNot only did CPCC take an $85 fee out of our refund for \""not dropping the class in time\"", but now we are having fight to get get the remaining amount of the refund.\nWhen she signed up for the class they took the money from our account that instant, but now 5 weeks and $85 in fees later, we are still fighting to get our refund.\nThere should be some kind of law to prevent this, but since there is not that is why we are going through this to try and get OUR money that CPCC owes us.\nWill post an update when and if this gets resolved, but after what we have already been throught with CPCC, I'm not holding my breath for an easy or fast resolution to this problem."
3,"Carbo looooooooooad!\n\nIt's oh-so-fun to carbo load at Great Harvest...a delicious little shop filled with the tastiest bread, sweets and cookies. I see that they also offer fresh sandwiches, but I have yet to nosh on one. All employees are very sweet & friendly and I *think* they still offer punch cards for frequent bread buyers! \n\nSome of my favorite items from Great Harvest...\n\nRosemary garlic: ZOMG. I could eat this at any time of the day...the perfect amount of salt and carb. The bread is great as is and even a bit better toasted up. Trust me. Get some. \n\nDakota: Perfect, substantial sandwich bread with pumpkin seeds on top!\n\nCinnamon swirl: A lower cal option to a cinnamon roll. With butter, yes please.\n\nCookies: In general, I have not come across a cookie I haven't loved here. \n\nCheck out their website for different bread bake days and make sure to score yourself some carby deliciousness. Nom."
3,"Great venue for a wedding - I attended a couple of weddings here and the chapel is very quaint.  If you like historic little places with lots of character and don't want to get married in an actual church, this is a great option. It is also centrally located between midtown & uptown districts, which is nice if you have people coming from out of town or simply from different sides of town. There is a beautiful garden outdoors with lots of trees and a sweet little gazebo which is perfect for those wedding photos."
3,"Adams 7th St Market is a great deli on the corner of Hawthorne and 7th St.  They have excellent sandwiches, soups and pastas.  You can get a sandwich \""roll\"" (medium sized) or hero (large sized).  I opted for a honey turkey club and found the roll size to be just right.  This particular sandwich was delicious: loaded with honey turkey, coleslaw and bacon.  I also enjoyed a side of pesto pasta salad - there were quite a few sides to choose from.  Prices are moderate, service was very quick, and the interior was comfortable and clean.  Highly recommended for lunch!"
2,"My husband and I have been here on multiple occasions including restaurant week and have always had an amazing time. On this occasion we went with another couple who have never been to the Melting Pot before. We were super excited because we always leave full and happy. \n\nWe made a reservation for 5 pm, on Saturday, the first weekend of restaurant week. It took 15 minutes to be seated, which is a bit out of character for them, but considering the day and the weekend, it was understandable. \n\nWe were seated In a booth upstairs with one burner, which is a mistake with two parties - if you are going with two couples request two burners, it will make your life so much easier. \n\nWe got the cheddar cheese fondue, the pacific meal, and we made our own chocolate, the dark chocolate swirled with peanut butter. The food itself was very good, but I think our waiter was new and did not know how to balance all of his tables. \n\nWe had to ask for more food several times. You can ask for more bread and apples for example until all of your cheese is gone and vegetables and dips during the dinner (meat) portion. We were getting enough of the main part of each course but only enough of the secondary parts like the vegetables and bread and such for half of our group. During the meat part we had to ask another Melting Pot employee for more vegetables and dip because we had given up on our waiter ever bring anything back...we had asked him 20 minutes prior. \n\nOur waiter also turned the burner on too high the entire time, and very rarely explained anything to us, including the dips and the batter during our meat course. I understand that we had been there before, but our friends hadn't. And they didn't get to hear all of the fun things to do with dips like fill the mushrooms with the green goddess, or that the plums sauce is good on the shrimp, or if you mix curry and plum it makes a delicious new sauce. \n\nI think the takeaways from this meal was to 1. Always get at least one burner per couple, 2. Make sure your burners are always on the appropriate heat setting because it will burn your food, and 3. If you are going during prime dining time during restaurant week be prepared to be patient.\n\n***Update. Not even an hour after this review the manager, Steven called me to go over my review and to chat in order to improve their business. I think this is awesome! Remember how I said we had asked another employee for more veggies and dips? It was him! He was amazing and had even tried to see if they had an extra two burner table at the beginning of the meal. With people like him the Melting Pot will always be in business."
3,"Food was really good and they have a great wine selection.  I will say we got there at 6:45 and the place was already packed full and the bar too.  Had to stand around for a bit.  Just my husband and I so we have some wine, waited for our table and had a really good time just of the two of us.  Great for date night, little crazy with a group of people."
2,"For the first time ever I ate at mama ricotta's tonight with my family, I went because my cousin told me it was good.  We ate family style and it was pretty good, I wasn't a fan of the caesar salad because the dressing taste like a tangy mayo.  Other than that it was pretty tasty food.  The service was excellent, our waitress was really nice and very promp.  We were in and out really fast, the longest wait we had was to be seated and that was about 10 minutes or so."
0,Food was terrible service was ok. We were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait and it turned into an hour and a half wait. Totally not worth it.
3,"One of my favorites.  The food and service are always excellent.   Whatever you have, ending with the bread pudding (not listed on the menu) and the tiramisu are a must!!!!"
4,"Ok I've been eating Italian, real Italian, all my life with my friends and family through New York and New England and even in Italy and I am blown away by the authenticity and quality of the food at Mama Ricotta's - I've lived in Charlotte for about 2 years now and have missed this place until today, New Years Eve 2014. It's not really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, thought it may be a sandwich/sub shop or some other take out type strip mall joint. DON\""T BE FOOLED by the unassuming street front. Go inside and check it out!! I literally stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. While taking in the inviting, Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile to let me know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment to look around their bar/lounge area which I will certainly be back to. I didn't see the wine list but it appears you'll most definitely be able to find something you like - I saw lots of good opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out by the staff that looked really nice. The bar keep thanked me, wished me Happy New Year and off I went.\nI ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely amazing!\nThe pasta was cooked perfectly - great texture and flavor. The gravy was bright red and full of fresh tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. The salad was certainly a masterpiece. Chopped is certainly the right name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn!\nNeedless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu. \nThanks, Mama!"
4,"I used to work here.  I miss it and the people.  Owned by Twiggy, she puts everything into this place.  The selection is insane and they still carry VHS!!!  Sure, you can go online and watch your crap but the whole purpose of this place is the local feel.  The non-corporate working man little video store that we all love and enjoy.  Staff has changed over the years.  Sure, there have been a few rudes ones. Overall this place is passionate about films and preserving the idea that people can still walk into a video store and just talk about movies.  I miss that.....\n\nLook for \""PICK\"" stickers to help guide you in your selection."
1,Horrible customer service. Unless you are into horror movies or The Simpsons the people working the counter can't give you a honest review. However they will make fun of your movie selections and treat you like crap. Can't wait to go back!!
0,"The staff were condescending and outright rude. \n\nThe place smells of a dentist's office, they don't have that much variety in their product, and the prices are subpar.\n\nAfter getting snapped at by one of the workers when I asked if they had any 52mm lens caps (the place they're normally kept was out), I decided to wander around and observe their interactions with other customers. It was much of the same. I watched them deal out the same condescending attitude and impatience with other people who came in. \n\nI'm impressed they can stay in business, honestly. My recommendation: just go online..."
2,"This is a CIAA weekend review.\n\nThe Big Chill is definitely properly named, especially the BIG part, the place is huge, several rooms including one huge main room.  It's also a laid back place for the most part so it was chill. A little on the fancy side but nobody was wearing tuxedos so it was chill in my eyes.\n\nThe night started slow and the size of the place kind of made it look too big but as people arrived the extra space was definitely needed and appreciated.  The club is big enough that you can dance and have a good time without constantly bumping into everyone around you but also not so huge that you won't still be around other people.\n\nThe bartenders were good and made the drinks strong but at the same time very reasonable priced. I'm used to DC prices when drinks are going for 10+ dollars, so a 5 or 6 dollar mixed drink was right up my alley.\n\nSecurity and the front door were cool, they knew people were there to have a good time and didn't go through all the pretending that their club was extra hot by making people wait outside for no real reason.  \n\nOne odd thing I did notice was that the group I was with all brought tickets in advance and some of the group, their tickets were brought by one guy, well at The Big Chill, the person who actually bought the tickets must be present for you to gain entry. I could see this being a problem if you get your tickets from a friend in advance but don't arrive to the party with them, you may have to wait. No huge issue though.\n\nThere is no real parking lot and if there is, it is either small or hidden, so we valeted the car but even that was affordable and honestly you just feel extra fancy when you pull up to a venue and somebody opens the door for you.\n\nThe Big Chill was a cool place to have a night out, definitely more fun if you're with a bigger crowd because like I said the place is a bit on the massive side but I judge places about how much fun I had and I had a cool time.\n\nI recommend The Big Chill for your partying needs."
3,"I went to Femme Fest at the Visulite and saw some great female performers. I really like the Visulite - with its cool but cozy interior. The only downside is that the floor is pretty tiny. I've stayed on the level just above the floor every time I've been there and ended up sitting at a table (and I'm normally a stand-right-by-the-stage concert-goer).\n\nI've also been impressed with the service at the bar each time I've gone. I guess I just expect to wait forever for a drink, but I've always had fast, attentive bartenders at the Visulite. Definitely check out a show there."
4,I've been going to the Visulite since it opened.  It's my favorite live music venue in Charlotte.  So many great bands have hit this stage.  Most of the staff have worked here since the beginning.  Great atmosphere.  Many wonderful memories!
4,"Great Indian restaurant!  It's like stepping across a few continents and tasting authentic Indian cuisine.  The \""naan\"" flat bread is piping hot when it comes to your table.  The garlic naan is my favorite.  And the curries are always wonderful.  \n\nIf you haven't tried Indian food, take your time getting used to the menu.   Generally the main dishes are chicken, lamb or vegetables, in a different kind of curry sauce.  If you go on a date you can order two or three plates and share.  The items toward the top of each list are simpler and less spicy.  The further down the menu you go, the more interesting and spicy the dishes get.  I recommend starting with \""medium\"" and seeing if that's too hot or if you'd actually like spicier.   If you ask for \""between mild and medium\"" they can do that too.  I like to pick one meat dish and one vegetable dish, usually something with potatoes.  Dinner comes with basmati rice (long grain rice with a little saffron).\n\nSuper friendly service although not American style waitering.  There is generally a head waiter who is also the host.  They will seat you and take your order.  After that, other waiters will serve you in turn, one getting drinks and another serving food.  It can be a bit slow at times, so don't go if you're in a rush.  Give yourself at least an hour or two.  Even if you decide curry's not for you, it's an amazing experience of completely different flavors. When in doubt, order a chicken dish."
0,Terrible service! We were overcharged thanks to the waiters inability to split a bill - each couple on a separate tab - a normal thing to do in a restaurant - NOT HERE! They tally up the whole table and divide by the number of credit cards given and charge each one the same amount regardless of what each couple ordered. Do not make the mistake of going with friends and expecting the restaurant to be able to give separate tickets seems you have to sit across the room from each other and pretend not to know each other in order for that to be possible. Food was not what it used to be. Will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go.
4,Best sushi I have had in Charlotte!
3,"I dined here as part of a group recently.  Overall, we had an excellent experience.  First, with arrangements having been made beforehand (as you should with a group), they were most accommodating! The service simply couldn't have been any better for our group!  Ian, the Manager, personally made sure that everything was taken care of for us.\nThose in our group tried quite a variety of things from the menus.  So first, about the menu... they are very extensive and include dishes from several areas that geographically surround Malaysia.  They have everything from Japanese Sushi, to Indian curries, to multiple Chinese favorites.  They even have some Malaysian specialties on the menu too!  ; )  Some of the dishes that seemed to stand out for our group included the Malaysian Sea Bass and another Malaysian dish made with Stingray (or Skate).  I had the Curry Duck and thought it was quite good! I think that everyone in our group enjoyed the dishes they ordered, and that (for me) is quite a statement!\nThe location is great for dining before or after downtown activities or sporting events and there is adequate parking on both sides of the building.\nI don't have much to recommend for improvement, except that it may be time to organize the menus a bit.  There is more than one version and they differ.  But then, whatever you find on the one you have, will most likely be good anyway..."
3,"Delicious, good service, one of our favorites places to eat.\n\nHighly recommend the sesame tofu - it is some of the best tofu I've ever had at a restaurant."
4,They serve THE BEST roti canai!! MUST EAT!! Highly recommendeddddddddddddddddddddddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"La-Tea-Da's just catered an early Thanksgiving Day luncheon at our office. They did a wonderful job with everything.  \n\nFor starters, they had an assortment of small biscuit sandwiches that looked like mini-ham sandwiches.  Since I don't partake in pork, I skipped those and headed straight for the good stuff.  \n\nThe buffet included sauteed green beans with carrots (fresh of course, not canned or frozen), broccoli & cheese casserole (delightful -no condensed cream of mushroom soup in that casserole!),  whipped potatoes with turkey gravy on the side, turkey, cranberry sauce (they had 2 - one with actual cranberries, and one of the icky congealed canned stuff), and a large assortment of breads and rolls. They also brought sweet tea, unsweet tea, and bottled water.  \n\nThey also prepared an entire table of desserts which included pecan pie, tiramsu, pumpkin pie, assorted brownies, cheesecake pops, and a few other things.  \n\nAgain, everything was delish but I guess we'll all be wearing our fat pants to work tomorrow!  (Seriously, we eat WAYYYY too much at our office - they need to install treadmills & elipitical machines in a breakroom or conference room!)\n\nSince I didn't plan the event, I can't say how easy they were to deal with, but I asked the person in charge of planning and she said they were great. I did go online and check their website, and the prices I saw for corporate events were very reasonable. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend La-Tea-Da's for catering."
3,"Who knew that Charlotte would have some of the biggest and well-stocked comic book stores, I've ever seen?\n\nHeroes is well-located, with a floor layout that makes sense. Open, inviting, bright and cheery, with a friendly staff that is neither too geeky or cool.  Massive amounts of comics, a smaller collection of figures; you can peruse until your heart's content.\n\nI'm not a hardcore comic book fan, but I love checking them out.  What I enjoy about Heroes is that it's environment that is welcoming to both intense enthusiasts and also passerbys."
0,I have ordered hot subs and for some reason they don't understand that not everyone wants white american. I gave them two chances and they haven't gotten it right yet! I will go to Sub Station across the street from now on!
3,"Great tailoring hands down. I've had jeans taken in, dresses altered and hems taken up - all perfectly done. I will say, though, that you get what you pay for, i.e. it's not affordable tailoring.  A pair of jeans cost $20 to be taken in, and $20 for hemmed pants or dress. While I personally think it's worth it for expert tailoring, others may think it's a bit overpriced for some of the basic tailoring. \n\nAlso, the staff are all very nice and will give very helpful tailoring advice when asked. You can trust your nicest pieces here - they are in good hands!"
4,"My man does it again.  Have taken 5 jackets to him now to tailor.  He has advised me on brands to buy that fit my build, told me to pass on tailoring pieces that will never fit me correctly, and repeatedly deliver quality work.  Highly recommend."
4,"big Ethiopian sized portions .. Your best bet is take a fellow heat seeker and get a combo plate , we had fish , chicken and veggies combo.. The veg was mostly lentils with a handful of lettuce salad but hit the spot. They also have a few bottle beers and that Honey Wine that they are famous for. Moderately priced I'll be back whenever I visit Charlotte. I live in Atlanta but to me this type of food is missing in Charlotte bcz I didnt see many foreigners around town. Don't go if you don't eat hot food but if you haven't had this type of cuisine the waitress seemed more than willing to explain what the dishes are .. And oh, don't expect fork and knife , the food is eaten with Injeera, ethiopian bread that resembles a sponge. It has a sour tastes from being fermented."
1,"Good chinese takeout here, seems to be hard to find.  This is the Hoho Cherry House.  The Hoho China Bistro is no more, but I heard it moved here.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good value, but the food here is right about average.  General Tso's is OK.  This is more along the lines of a Panda Express, but mom and pop owned.  For that, I expected more.  Nothing to rave about, but not terrible either."
4,"Ho Ho Cherry House is my favorite Chinese. \n\nMy criteria for picking Chinese consists of a crispiness factor - I usually get sesame chicken or General Tso's -and nothing is grosser then soggy chicken covered in thick sauce\n\n....This place does it just right - and its very very affordable (think very casual Chinese restaurant definitely not upscale!) - nice crispy/ light chicken complete with  pretty good although not super memorable side items such as fried rice and an egg roll. For me though, personally they have the crispy chicken nailed - so Im in!"
0,"This might be the worst Chinese I've ever tasted in my life...and i'm a college student so I've had a lot. I don't have a car so i ordered the sesame chicken and the beef with broccoli to go...two of my favorite standby dishes. the sesame was way too battered and was smothered with the sauce so much that i was literally scraping it off. it's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff...nasty. and the beef with broccoli was worse! it tasted like the \"" brown sauce\"" was day old gravy and the meat was like the mystery meat that you'd get at a middle school cafeteria. on second though i think my cafeteria was better. and the broccoli tasted acidic. it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza. seriously, don't go here."
1,"Man, I really want this place to be good... but it's not.  A shame - it's so convenient to get delivery (especially when it snowed, hah).  Quintessential Chinese take-out isn't all that great in the first place, but Cherry House's dishes don't even measure up to that standard.\n\nProbably the most annoying thing about the beef, chicken, or shrimp entrees is the abundance of vegetables.  Don't get me wrong - I love my greens, but there just isn't much in the way of protein.  Having ordered a variety of entrees, each of them just go overkill with the veggies.  You feel cheated - the dishes should be along the lines of \""snow peas, carrots, and a sampling of shrimp.\""  And to make matters worse, despite the diversity of dishes available, there's about three flavor profiles available:  (1) salty; (2) sweet; and (3) sweet and salty. \n\nHot and Sour Soup - They're doing it wrong.  The viscosity is off, and it's neither hot nor sour, really.  \n\nWhen my sister visited and tried this place, she said everything from there tastes like broom handle.  I've never had the pleasure of trying broom handle (and I don't know how she would know...) but I take it that it's no filet.\n\nFor me, the coup de grace was hair in my food the last two times I ordered!  Supremely unpleasant and tossed it out immediately.  You want to believe it was an accident the first time, but when it happens twice in a row... it's no accident.  Something's busted with the people, product, or process.\n\ndmo out."
2,"Nothing special.  Went during winter, and while they still served frozen yogurt, I didn't get a chance to try it.  The rest of the foods were basic concession-stand items.  Burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, etc.  Would probably be nice for a visit in the summer, but not exactly a lunch destination."
3,"I dined at Carpe Diem during restaurant week with a group of 7 others.  The goat cheese salad featured some tasty onions and tart goat cheese, but the dressing was lacking in flavor and it definitely didn't live up to the expectation that several \""yelpers\"" had set.  The salmon entree was spot-on, and the relish topping popped with incredible flavor.  Finally, the chocolate pudding was decadent and the perfect end to the meal.  \n\nMy only complaint was the service.  Our waitress appeared to be in a less-than-enthusiastic mood from the start.  She rushed our drink orders within 30 seconds of being seated, required that we order appetizer, entree, and dessert all at once, failed to refill drinks, and then made errors on our receipts.  I love enjoying a fancy meal out, but there is simply nothing more frustrating than sub-par service.\n\nFor more details, including pictures, you can read my complete review.\nhttp://trifoodiemd.blogspot.com/2013/01/carpe-diem-restaurant.html"
4,"We are from Ohio.  I first made a reservation here back in October when I was looking for a nice place to have our anniversary dinner.  It did not disappoint.  Everything was wonderful.  From the moment we walked in the door and were greeted by the hostess, then we moved to the bar to have a drink before dinner and had a very nice conversation with the bartender.  When we were seated at our table we were greeted by a very friendly busboy who filled our water glasses and asked how we were.  Finally the service was outstanding.  Since we are both from up north we had never had grits, so our server brought us out a sample to try and they were excellent.  We both ordered the specials.  Being a vegetarian I was impressed, not only with the selections on the menu, but they also had a vegetarian special.  Everything was amazing.  It was a wonderful evening.  We just recently went back in February and it was just as good the second time around as the first.  Everyone is so friendly and professional and the food is out of this world.  I would highly, highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice, quiet place to have a delicious meal."
2,"Decent food.  No desire to go back for a second try.  Salad was good but the fried chicken is very bland.  I don't know why the place is supposedly known for fried chicken but it does not even break my top 10 for fried chicken.  I'm from the south and know fried chicken.  It was tender but very, very bland."
0,"I cannot believe this place exists! How is it competitive in Charlotte?\nThe flavors are absurdly overdone: super salty, super sweet, and conflicting in that they pair savory with super sweet and drown it all out.\nI may have an answer: the place is filled with the elderly. Maybe it's \""The Walking Dead\"" tongues. Seriously, the youngest person there was in their early 50's. It's like a \""speak-easy\"" for the rich elderly...it just keeps afloat by a secret handshake that acknowledges you are in a terrible place but you can be old there without the riff-raff.\nAlso, it is terribly expensive for the low quality they are putting on the plate. Even the drinks are super sweet.\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
3,Now Ive never been to New Orleans but I love this place!!! Its perfect for my boyfriend and I to go! We love the drinks and the free entertainment oh and the fried oysters!!! I would recommend the Hurricane Drink so good! \n\nThe Service is always good and friendly!
4,"One oft favorite joints in Charlotte. Between the jazz band, etoufee, and shrimp& grits this place takes the cake."
4,"I LOVE this restaurant. So far, I have only been twice, but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also delicious\n\nFor my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, \""Slow down, it's not going anywhere!\"" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).\n\nUnfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol."
0,"I have been to this place plenty of times. I have always had good meals and service. But tonight was bad. I went ther with my wife's work friends. We sat at the bar tables and had a bartender named Bo(very red hair)   We had About 8 people and he insisted that if we sit at the tables we have to order food, which we had planned to do. He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was Friday and happy hour, so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us, until it came time to pay the bill, then he was really nice(tip time! Overall the food is good there, but Bo did not make it a pleasant experience. Smile Bo, it will get you far in life!"
4,What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:)
3,"Had dinner here in the upstairs dining room near the live band.  The food was excellent and the portions were generous/filling.  The BBQ shrimp appetizer is tremendous.  An excellent way to start your meal.  \n\nThe food is prepared well and in a timely manner.  I had blackened catfish with veggies (very well prepared and large portion) and thought it was phenomenal.  I thought the gumbo could be a bit better, but overall, the meal was really good.\n\nService was solid as well.  Can be tough to converse if you dine in the room with the band...they are really good but, as expected, it is pretty loud.  Overall a very good place to have a meal."
2,The Cajun Queen is a really nice neighborhood restaurant for me. The service is consistently good especially in the bar. I love the atmosphere and the live Dixieland jazz is a wonderful plus.\n\nWhat troubles me now and has troubled me from the first time I started going to the CQ : it seems like the kitchen believes everything must be really hot (spicy) since it's a Cajun restaurant. But some things just shouldn't be hot. Tonight I ordered the crawfish scampi appetizer. Scampi is generally shellfish flavored with garlic and herbs. Red pepper flakes are sometimes added but not as a predominant flavor. The CQ  added so much chili that it overpowered the crawfish. There is not a lot of difference between the scampi and etouffee which is supposed to be hot. If they would just not be so heavy-handed with the Cajun spices.....
4,"Interesting concept, having a restaurant in a kind of living family house, but that is common for the upscale Elisabeth area in Charlotte. Very good food, not quite Southern as in Louisiana but very close. Very friendly staff and quick service. Had to visist my hometown to go there, shame on me since I lived 5 years in Charlotte and never went eating there. We had a great time and can recommend it to everyone!"
2,The fried oysters are to die for.\n\nThe crayfish scampi looks great but a bit too garlicky.\n\nThe BBQ shrimp is just a-ok.\n\nReal cool how they turned an old house into CQ.
1,"I have been in Charlotte for over three years and had never been to Cajun Queen, but I have been listening to Jazz a lot lately and got in the mood for some live Jazz. From what I have been able to find, this is the only place in Charlotte that even has live Jazz, so I booked a reservation (through OpenTable) for my girlfriend and I on a Saturday night.\n\nNo problems with the reservation or getting us seated as soon as we got there, but I was immediately disappointed to find out that the music was only upstairs and there would be a \""20-30 minute wait\"" for seating upstairs. We were seated downstairs, right next to the entrance--it's not great seeing everyone come and go, as well as the staff milling about the hostess stand.\n\nOur dinner started with no live Jazz (from downstairs it sounded like pots/pans being banged together) and less than ideal seating. Then came the food. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special. Certainly not good enough to warrant all of the rave reviews here or the prices they charge. It was seasoned, but still tasted very bland to me, especially the crawfish, which I thought was overcooked. The seasoning certainly did not taste Cajun to me. (I got the crawfish Creole and my girlfriend had the chicken Etouffee.)\n\nI was definitely not pleased with my first--and last--experience at Cajun Queen, and left $60 poorer and hungry for better food, although I was full. Given that \""Live Jazz 7 nights a week\"" is prominently touted on their website header, they really need to specify that it is only upstairs. I would have requested upstairs seating when I made the reservation, if I had known that was the only place to hear the music. Either that, or they need to remodel that old, bland house to open it up more.\n\nBottom line: I will not be going back."
4,The have some of the best ribs and rib tips in Charlotte. Tea and lemonade made fresh.
2,"Yes I love Burger King. Yes I know its terrible for me. No I will not stop coming here. \n\nI love this location, even though someone was shot in the face here not too long ago, I still can not stay away. I love the fact that I can go through the drive-thru and not have to worry about checking my bag for the right items because they have never messed up one order of mine. And that is pretty damn rare for fast food.\n\nOther than that typical BK fare."
1,"This is not a review of Amtrak, traveling via train, or any particular train line. I repeat, THIS IS A STATION REVIEW! I don't care if a train is on-time, late, or not running at all. That's a problem for another review. What I want to tackle here is the ode to modernist architecture that is the Charlotte Amtrak Station. This thing, oy. \n\nLet's start with the fact that it's a station with multiple overnight passengers, but they maintain one vending machine and one coke machine that sells--get this--Pepsi. Foul language may have tumbled out of my mouth when I stumbled into the station past midnight to see that sorry sight. Bless their little hearts. \n\nThen we can turn to the actual lobby of the station. The imposing (?) concrete (?) walls (?) that tower two whole stories up and are finished with thrown gravel both inside and out do bring to mind a certain era. It's like the 1960s municipal architecture experience has never been reconsidered. The thrown gravel panels inside the building are an odd choice, but I understand that we don't all have the money for good taste. \n\nThe benches are hard and of a certain era when people were meant to slide off them, I think. I certainly did. There was some sleep to be had, and I appreciated that it was quiet and safe inside the station...even though the station was ugly. And it is ugly. Don't visit hoping to see one of the great humanist temples of old. But consider taking a nap on the benches...provided you are a ticketed passenger, of course. \n\nAccessibility notes: Doors open in. Ramps are plentiful. Well-lit. Braille signage. Ticket counters are high."
4,"All I have to say is Hayley is very talented. I had a great experience here, you may need to be patient. I took me about 3 months to get in to see her, but was well worth the wait."
2,"Staying near the airport in Charlotte on a business trip, I was looking for a dinner place nearby...found the Ranch House on Yelp.  First off, it is one of the only real restaurants in a wasteland near the airport.  Fast food and gas stations abound, so if you are there and looking for a dining option, this is the one.  Don't be thrown off by the hulkin security guard in the parking lot either....the place is fine.\n   One piece of advice...when folks say it is dark....it is DARK.  If you are getting old and you forget your reading glasses, forget about reading the menu.  Hell, bring a flashlight.  \n   At any rate, we were seated immediately (there was a large party having a really good time on the other side of the restaurant) in a booth.  Nothing fancy like tableclothes here...but there are clothe napkins. The menu is very simple....steak and more steak.  I ordered the 22 ounce cowboy ribeye medium rare and that is exactly what I got.  It comes with a salad (chopped iceberg lettuce and two radish slices) and your choice of side (steamed veggies or potatoes).  The steak was fine. I wouldn't put in par with the finest steak houses, but it compared favorably to Ruby Tuesday or Outback.  It was well prepared and was buried under three large onion rings.  A little on the fatty side, but tasty.  I would liken it to the best supermarket steak you would buy and grill yourself. \nUnfortunately, I was under the weather, so other than the house merlot and a shot of glenlivet after dinner, nothing else to report.  Our waitress was sociable.  The atmosphere was utilitarian.  I wouldn't rave about the place, but considering some of the eateries I find on the road, this one was okay.  In other words, I'd go back (for a meat fix).  \nPricewise, this ain't cheap.  My ribeye was $29 and my colleagues 13 ounce boneless ribeye was $22.  \nStrangest thing about the Ranch House....although it is a steak house, there was absolutely no smell of food in the place.  No charred meat odor, nothing at all."
2,"This airport leaves a bit to be desired.  YES it is super busy, like most airports, and yes it has some growing pains to deal with, but honestly it just isn't well organized.  The baggage claim is sprawling and they seem to group flights by airline (not spread by time) so you get overcrowding.  The A/C was off the day I arrived in 94 degree weather so it wasn't optimal for hanging out.  The nearby but not attached car rental desks are scattered... just not great.  \n\nIt worked, I landed, and I'll use it again, of course, but it just wasn't the best airport I've ever been to.  (Pittsburgh)\n\n-MRO"
4,"The rocking chairs are genius!\n\nThey're perfect for weary travelers that just want to relax especially those of us in between flights. Ahhh genius.\n\nAnd did I mention the food, they have everything you might be craving and some new ideas that will get your mouth watering. \n\nThe staff was polite and helpful. \n\nSome other airports need to come study this airport's success and learn a thing or 20."
2,"Free WiFi everywhere in the airport!\n\nCute rocking chairs in the main lobby. \n\nA few small shops.\n\nMostly fast food restaurants. The non-fast food restaurants are spread pretty far and wide. \n\nIt's a pretty good hike between concourses but there are walking sidewalks in places. \n\nOverall, it's an ok transfer point. Pack a lunch and sit a spell in the rocking chairs until your next flight."
2,"Wonderful food and shopping available, but why does the restroom have a valet in it taking tips?  This isn't a European nightclub."
2,"Busy and confusing. It's a nice and large open space filled with many escalators and walking escalators. The people are friendly and do try their best to help. Every terminal/section has a special desk where people who have missed their flights can go to rebook and/or get on standby flights. Unfortunately, the customer service desks cannot handle situations where there is a large number of people who need help. The lines can get absolutely ridiculous!! \n\nOverall, a relatively comfortable area (for an airport) with plenty of food options."
2,"The airport is okay as far as large hub airports go. However, the security checkpoint is small with a pretty bad bottle neck for screening. I found this to be a bit slow and crowded more space would have been appreciated and made this a more pleasent experience. \n\nOn the upside baggage claim divisions were well spread out to prevent crowding with good signage and listings of where to go for your particular flight.  The fountain outside by the ground transport sites makes a nice view while waiting for your ride or shuttle.\n\nOverall okay airport, not bad or great, just okay."
2,"Very nice airport if you have time to loiter before you flight.  Free Wi-Fi, nice rocking chairs, decent restaurant selections, good shops.  BUT, this airport is NOT made for those with tight connections.  Its spider layout makes it problematic if you get in at a high B gate and have an E gate departure.  RUN don't walk if you have less than 20 minutes to board your next flight.  You may even want to wear a pair of Depends so you can just soil yourself to save time.  I also think it's awkward having bathroom attendants."
2,"This would get such a good review if it weren't for a strong negative or two.\n\nOverall, it's good.  Quite a few food options.  D and E Terminals are pretty nice (A and B, also, if I can remember correctly?).  The Mexican place in the Food Court isn't that bad.\n\nNo experience with security, parking, or check-in, tho, since it's always a connection from CHA or TYS.\n\nNow, the two things that really are irritating:  Why do I ALWAYS have to fly in on Runway R18?!?!?  It takes a friggin' fortnight to taxi to the D or E gates from here.  Uggghhhhh.\n\nThe other is the distance between terminals.  E gates are spread out like crazy, and if you're walking from A to E or something similar, then good luck.\n\nFortunately, if you fly US more often than DL, you connect here instead of ATL.  Charlotte doesn't get as many random storms, and the airspace/runway traffic isn't as bad, so delays aren't as likely as they are down in the A.  Unfortuantely, if I fly out of here back to CHA and a flight gets cancelled, I'm probably stuck for the night, as I could hop on a shuttle van if flying in ATL instead :/  Oh well."
1,"Had a layover here recently coming in from an international destination. Customs wasn't too bad, basically waved us through. But we had to exit to the main terminal and re-go thru security, which is freaking insane! We had an 80 minute lay over and I think we only got to the plane with 20 minutes to spare - they were already boarding. ugh!"
2,Pretty efficient as far as airports go. Usually an hour preflight is good depending on where you're going. I generally fly us airways and have never encountered a problem with anything. Smooth lines for security and I recommend going through the d/e checkpoint as it almost always seems to be less congested and quicker than it's counterparts!  Happy flying :)
3,"First things first, if it wasn't for Jim (my GPS which I've named as part of the family), I would never find this airport. Mostly because I'm not familiar with the area but also because airports tend to be hidden away even though their main purpose is, in fact, for people to find them and fly away from them. Aside from that, I find this airport a little deceiving. I've been to some SMALL airports (Bangor, Maine. Moncton, New Brunswick.) and I assumed, when walking into this one, that it was small like the previous ones mentioned. So I walk through security (more like shuffle considering the traffic and security procedures), which I might add, are thorough and friendly, and I come to this whole new DIMENSION! The size of this airport is hidden until you cross security, then it's a playground (so to speak). I do like this airport a lot. I can shop (lets be serious, airport stores do have some great things), eat, lounge and board planes. The place has ALMOST everything I need! The only thing I hate about the airport (and most airports) is that the wifi isn't free. So pick up a magazine prior to arriving because you'll need it to keep occupied. Unless you're a people watcher, in which case, knock yourself out!"
1,"I would give this place a 3 if the organization of the parking lots/interior was better and if there wasn't someone standing in the bathroom making me uncomfortable when I have to go to the bathroom while I'm waiting for a flight.\n\nFor the amount of air traffic that goes through this airport, I'm disappointed. The lines for security generally take an hour to get through (more if you leave around 5ish).\n\nI've been avoiding flights due to the crazy bad for you radiation from the full body scanners. Maybe CLT will improve when I eventually cave and need to fly somewhere- who knows."
2,"I had a connecting flight out of this airport from Austin to Indianapolis but due to weather delays and aircraft problem ended up spending more time here than necessary.  If it weren't for the free Wi-fi I would have lost my mind.\n\nMy only real negative experience was with US Airways, and with the gestapo bathroom attendants.  They have tip jars in the restrooms and the paper towel dispensers are empty so they force you to get your paper towel from the attendants.  If you don't leave a tip, they will curse you out.\n\nWhen my flight was canceled I headed over to Tequileria and had a couple strong house margaritas (at $11.39 each) and a salmon quesadilla. Then I headed to my paid hotel room (thanks US Airways).\n\nOverall, this is not a bad airport, but using the restroom should not be such an unpleasant experience! I would recommend wearing headphones to throw off the rude attendants. Otherwise enjoy the free wi-fi."
0,"CLT is a pathetic airport for commuters who have to fly from smaller cities. The E concourse is getting further and furhter away from the gates to the flagship flights of US Airways. Half the time walking sidewalks are inoperable, and if you have less than 15 minutes (due to the wonderful on time of  US Airways Express (outsourced and don't care) then you will miss your flight. They could care less regardless of your status, and are now adding more gates at E.  (Up to 50 I believe, and no fast way to to get to B or C concourse). Obviously they care nothing about the deregulation that then the airlines elected the HUB and spoke philosophy. Trust me it DOES NOT work!  Will they ever listen to their customers, and especially the business traveler who kept them in business after 911 since we were the only ones who continued to fly.\nAt this point I don't think they care."
2,I was at this airport for a few mins as I connected. Would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at LAX was delayed for no reason.
1,@ Charlotte and ready for boarding!!
1,"I connected through CLT on a recent trip. I have to say, as a former resident of the Charlotte area, and after experiencing the ease of my home airport (Dallas-Fort Worth Int'l), this airport could be so much better.\n\nIt seems that CLT just keeps building on to itself and is making itself bigger and stretched so far that it is now a chore to have a connecting flight there."
2,"I had a long layover at the Charlotte-Douglas airport going to and from New Orleans. I got to spend some time meandering around this airport.\n\nI like the layout - much more than other airports - and it's easy to get around from flight to food, etc. They have a center terminal and circular intersections of the other various terminals that all have huge beautiful windows and white rocking chairs. After I ate some food in the food court (mostly fast food, but a few decent options), I spotted an open rocking chair and made myself at home. \n\nI also utilized their FREE WIRELESS! I think it should be standard that wireless is free in all airports and it always bothers me when it isn't. It's a fun people watching airport too while sitting in the chairs."
0,"Like long lines and employees who LIE than CLT is the place for you. I was flying US airs and they are just as awful. This place is a joke and I will no longer be flying anywhere what would require using CLT. I had my husband 1 baby 1 4 yr old and my 70 yr old grandmother and they told me to go through the family line for security. I went through and this rude \""renta cop\"" said that the line was ONLY for employees, pushed us into another line that took 45 minutes to get through. I turn around and hes letting everyone and their brother go through that line. He just didnt want to deal with the stroller or the kids. HES AN ASS!"
3,"Charlotte-Douglas Airport is pretty standard for those jetsetting or catching a connecting flight to the left coast. Don't be late, don't give a bunch of guff to TSA, understand that airport vittles, restaurants and other eateries most likely won't receive a Michelin Star, and don't leave your bags unattended then you'll probably have a palatable experience. \n\nOne thing I do love about the QC's airport is the variation in security checkpoints. If you A and B are slammed busy, walk down about 50 yards to C or D and the lines are almost always shorter and typically faster. Most people congregate to A and B since they are closer to the beginning of curbside drop-off. Fear not! On those buys travel days, seek out the slimmer lines of the other TSA's at C and D. You'll be happy you did. \n\nGlad to have a very accessible and friendly airport in town. Happy to fly out and even more excited to fly back in! Also, I think most of the construction at baggage claim is wrapping up for the most part. Lookin' rather clean! Great job!"
3,"CLT is a convenient airport despite being a rather busy hub, with a fair amount of international traffic.  When I used to fly US Airways all the time, CLT would figure in my travel at least once a week.  Now, it's rare that I get to go through CLT.\n\nIt's a fairly new airport and the layout and amenities show that.  It has a wide open, airy feel to it in most concourses, especially the International concourse.  The central area where the B and C concourses meet can be a bit of a madhouse at times with people rushing between gates.  But there, in the midst of all this traffic, are dozens of cozy Adirondack style chairs where you can relax for a bit if you have the time between flights.\n\nThere is often some live entertainment in the central area... grand piano, country music, jazz - I've seen it all.  Lots of food options too - and a full fledged cigar/tobacco store - woohoo!!!\n\nWeather in the area is usually good which means minimal flight delays.  Delays are inevitable in a hub airport but when they do happen, CLT makes the experience a little less stressful by providing a lot of distractions in addition to the wonderful Southern charm of all the people working here.\n\nGreat place to connect if you're headed to the Caribbean - you're almost there already ;)\n\n~ 4 solid stars for a solid, dependable and charming \""little\"" big airport.  CLT may not be my favorite airport but it's one I'm quite fond of.\n\n# 280"
2,"As a North Carolina native now living in DC, I come through Charlotte Douglas pretty frequently.  I've never had a problem in this airport, but don't like the hub and spoke layout.  If you land in one Terminal and have to get to another quickly, you better pick up the pace, as there is no train between terminals.  There's plenty of shopping, restaurants, and bars, but the layout makes it less than convenient to get to what you want."
3,"Basically the totally opposite of Newark Liberty Airport.\n\nClean and well-lit. Friendly and courteous TSA members, and fast and efficient layout and service."
2,Huge airport.  Clean and lots of shopping.
2,"I fly into Charlotte a lot when I venture over to SC and I don't mind the lengthy layovers at DIA at all. \n\nDouglas International is a medium-sized airport. Your main form of transportation within the airport is a system of moving sidewalks, which does the trick nicely (occasionally you will get the oblivious person who blocks the whole sidewalk, and doesn't stand to the right side and let the walkers pass by). \n\nThere are a few really good spots to eat. My favorite is the sushi spot in the main food court area, it's an awesome spot for people watching. The food court (as well as a few other parts of the airport) is littered with white rocking chairs. I think these add charm and they help give DIA it's own unique identity in a way, plus it's a nice place to relax and rock while you wait! There's also a piano in the main food court area as well. I've seen people playing for tips, adding a nice element to the surrounding hustle and bustle.\n\nThere are a lot of other airports that have a lot more to do than DIA, but this spot is nice. I won't go overboard with my stars because it's a US Airways hub, and they screw me about 90% of the time. \n\nIt's a nice metropolitan airport that has a nice down-home feel to it!"
2,One of the best US Airways hub airports.
3,"Decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the Brooks Brothers store.  Once you're done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight, you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium.  The rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you can.\n\nThe only complaint I have are with the transport carts.  They are constantly beeping no matter what direction they're going.  I can understand the beeping while in reverse, but it's really annoying when it's constant.  Especially when you have 40 minutes to kill at the gate.\n\nThank goodness for the free WiFi..."
3,This is what a NYC airport should look like. It's \nchic and they have a wine bar!!! Why would a North Carolina airport have a \nchic wine bar. I thought i would land at a crappy run down airport like LaGuardia airport but to my surprise the south is more modern than NYC??? odd. NYC get with it!!!!!!
2,"Ugh, who likes going to the airport. Over the past years I've watched the process of flying go from a adventurous, fun experience to an annoying, convoluted torture exhibition. Flying is a necessary evil in this day and age, and since this airport is less than a half hour from our apartment, it's our 'port of choice.\n\nThey just renovated the parking garages, so you can no longer simply park across the street and walk to the airport...you have to park at a somewhat off-site garage and catch a shuttle bus to the airport. The wait is as annoying as it is at any airport between getting through security and waiting for the airline and airport to figure out which gate they will be using for your flight. There's a decent number of expensive restaurants (like Wendys) and shops to charge that wonderful airport upcharge.\n\nI don't like flying, I doubt you like flying. It's just something we have to deal with, and this is as good a place as any to get it done."
3,"Whenever I'm booking a flight that requires a connection (which, let's be real, is almost always the case from RIC) and Charlotte appears as an option, I take it. It's easy to navigate, isn't overwhelming and offers standard food options as well as a few of my traveling faves. Jamba Juice, Pinkberry, TCBY? Yes, please!\n\nIt even boasts rocking chairs (welcome to the South, y'all) and free wi-fi. Doesn't get much better than that during a layover."
1,"I really really hate this airport. It is always a bitch flying in and out of it. Not to mention that 2 out of the 4 times I've flown through and had a connecting flight, they've lost my bag during the transfer from one plane to the next including my returning from Dublin. Trust me, when you've been flying 12 hours and have two connections before reaching your final destination, the last thing you want to worry about is if your bag is going to be there when you arrive. This indeed happened, and I didn't get my bag for 3 days. That was a mess since I had been living in another country for six months and everything in there was all I'd had. \n\nI try to avoid Charlotte airport at all costs unless it is my absolute final destination which has yet to ever be the case."
2,"We were on our way back from a trip to Mexico and Cuba* when we arrived here for a short layover. This airport is easy to navigate, especially when you are coming through immigration -- there are lots of signs telling you exactly where to go. \n\nThere was a long line at immigration but it moved fairly quickly. My honey and I had all of our research license paperwork in order for the Cuba portion of our travels in case we were asked for it** but the not-even-a-hello immigration officer guy just scanned our passports, looked at us with his best stern face, and stamped us on our way. We then picked up our checked suitcases, zoomed right through customs (after handing over our customs form) and rechecked our bags. \n\nThe part that ended up taking the longest amount of time was going back through security, thanks to long lines. I do have to say that the security personnel were working very hard to move everyone along and were really nice as well.\n\nIf we had more than 5 minutes to spare, I would have picked up some local BBQ to eat on our San Francisco bound flight. Thanks a lot, security line. \n\n*You won't hear much more about our trip to Mexico and Cuba since they don't have Yelp. (At least not yet.) I'll just summarize to say that almost everywhere we slept, ate, drank, visited, etc. were unquestionably five star. \n\n** Apparently Beyonce and Jay Z did as well. http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/09/entertainment-us-usa-cuba-beyonce-idUSBRE93600V20130409"
2,"They are in the middle of revamping the parking near the terminals.  Easy peasy airport.  The food options are lacking, but I imagine they will fix that eventually.  How about some of that well known NC BBQ in the terminals??"
3,"Decent airport, but it is always a mass of humanity.  Be sure to stay in your seat if you get one, because you will lose it."
2,"It's an airport, small but had what it needed. Planes."
3,"Actually this is one of my favorite airports. I like the fact that there are rocking chairs in all the terminals for use by weary passengers. The food selection in the main area is not bad as well as some of the offerings in the different terminals. Flights are usually pretty much on time unless there is a major thunderstorm passing through the area.\n\nI chose to travel on an airline other than USAIR, which \""owns\"" this place, and everything went quite well. The airport is very clean and everyone is courteous. Not a bad place to spend time between flights."
2,Standard place that grew fast and has lots of spider webs.
4,I have never been to an airport before where I would want to come back and just hang out. Get my nails done? Check! Superb southern food? Check! Legit shopping? Check and check!
2,"CLT used to be better, but their passenger volume has increased significantly. I used to fly out of here as my main airport from 2005-2010, but have since moved away and just returned back. \n\nIt is moderately-sized and laid out well, with well-placed maps throughout the terminal. There is also a decent selection of restaurants.\n\nThe downside that I found on my recent trip is that volume is up heavily and there is not enough room to accommodate the additional passengers. The hallways were packed and there were no empty seats to be found.\n\nEven the U.S. Airways lounge was crowded."
3,"Charlotte has grown I remember when the airport was small now it's like a little city of it's own. I don't mind waiting for a plane here as they have plenty of places to eat and pass time. They made it look real nice and \""purdee\"" inside so you feel like you're in a nice place unlike Newark or JFK which are boring as hell to me. I don't think the majority of passengers will be disappointed passing through here."
1,"I've been to so many airports over the years that I can't even name them all. In the morning, this airport is certainly quiet. But it's also dead. I came in on a red eye. By 6, almost nothing in the D terminal is open. And the one sit down restaurant that is open has no outlets. While it's nice to have charging stations by the gates, travelers who work like to sit down and enjoy their meal while banging out some work and charging their equip. More restaurants with outlets and open before 7 for early travelers would go a long way to improving this place."
2,"Charlotte Douglas International Airport is a complete madhouse, but the cuisine is off the chains. \n\nI had a lay over here and was shocked at the sheer volume for a small market city. You would be forgiven if you mistook this airport for LAX or ORD, it is that busy. Huge lines and very few charging areas for your cell phone will frustrate even a seasoned traveler. \n\nThe food choices however are commendable. If you are hungry you owe it to yourself to seek out Carolina Pit Barbecue in the main terminal as it is the damn truth. Smoky, tender and so moist... truly delicious. A small piece of heaven in a travelers hell."
3,I really enjoyed my time here and the kids I brought song enjoyed it too! There are some planes that you can get inside of and volunteers to explain it all to you. The volunteers were so helpful! We were able to watch a plan take off from the airport. So cool! I really wish they had a restaurant for lunch. But other than that I really enjoyed the museum.
0,"Floyds on Nation Ford rd is terrible!!!! Worst collards and macoroni and whatever in the world. And space. Taste like noodles, salt, and water. No milk or cheese. Not made with love. Food made with HATE. Im so sorry the owner died. Should have taken this so called restaurant with him. I should have known the food was gonna be bad because of the bad service!!! Floyds food does not taste nearly as good as mine. Reply to my post and i will sell a real recipe for collards and real macaroni and cheese. Oh, the location milton road food excellent!! Holla at me or them to learn how to cook!!!"
3,"Went there 6 in the morning. It's just like any McDonald's, you should know what they serve. The staff is very friendly and helpful."
0,I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
2,"We only went through the drive-thru and the service was pretty quick with not many cars to serve. My breakfast burritos had hard corners like were bad or cooked to long. They were also folded kind of weird, like all four corners under instead of bottom, left, and right, and like some effort was actually put into them. It's also kind of shabby they offer water at the same price and a regular drink. I'm not looking for free, but at least half the price of drink that have to be ordered and delivered. We are talking about water here, simply water. The ice coffees on the other hand were at least made with a generous amount of flavor. The were yummy and definitely worth my dollar. The staff should also work on communication, instead seemed a bit aggressive and not very personable."
4,"Great selection and don't be fooled by the prices because they haggle and you can get a very competitive deal there. If you don't like to haggle then check out their website for their online deals. That is where you find the usual rock-bottom pricing for the firearms they carry. I'm like a kid in a candy store when I go to Hyatt's. It's located in the hood but don't let that stop you. Once inside you will feel very safe as every employee is carrying heat! Don't have a gun? Go there! Don't want a gun? Good, it will be easy to take your food when the zombie apocalypse happens."
1,"If you didn't know where it was you'd miss it.  Dining area is sparse, basic tables and booths. Open deli-style.  \n\nGot the chicken parm sub as recommended by Yelpers.  Mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich.  Still not sure i would order it again.  Fries are standard crinkle-cut.  \n\nSummary: good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but I wouldn't go out of my way to come again."
0,"Went to see Joe Nichols last night and was disappointed in a few things.  First of all my friend and I went to the bar to get a drink and they don't accept credit cards!  What established bar/event venue doesn't accept credit?? Then the real problem arose... during the concert, some drunk idiots started causing issues.  One guy spilled his beer all over everyone around him and they were bumping and pushing people.  Someone went to get the bouncer and he just came and told the guy to stop.  Obviously that didn't do anything so the problem continued.   This was all during my favorite song which really made me mad.  The bouncer ended up coming back and getting the guys.  Later, during another GREAT song, the guys came back and pushed in front of us.  Next thing you know the guy got in a fight with all the other people around him.  It was a huge brawl and it took a good long time for any bouncers to arrive.  I felt very unsafe this whole time and it was because of the lack of awareness and/or the lack of care that the bouncers had for the well being of the patrons.  Will probably not be going back and will definitely not recommend going to any of my friends."
1,"I came to Beauregard's for their mystery dinner theater on Saturday evening. I was surprised they offered something like this since the set-up was less than ideal. We were suppose to mingle around and interview the suspects, but it was tough to identify suspects because 1) many people were in costume, 2) they did introduce themselves but the mic was very quiet so it was extremely difficult to hear 3) There was very little room in between people and there was a big column blocking the main stage area.  \n\nUpon are arrival we had salads waiting for us. This was bagged iceberg shredded lettuce, a mealy tomato, and a cucumber. This was beyond uninspired but the dressing was tasty (though bottled most likely). Our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta. I thought the prime rib was better than expected. It was a tad on the small/thin side but it was cooked right (I asked for rare) and it was served with a nice baked potato and some au jus. I tried the pasta which wasn't amazing, but it certainly wasn't bad. The dessert was a pineapple orange pound cake which I found to be an odd choice. I was expecting it to be a signature dessert so I thought it might be good. It wasn't. It was served with canned pineapple and was overwhelmingly sweet. Why not serve chocolate cake, cookies, mousse? Those are choices more people are likely to enjoy. \n\nThe service was friendly -if a bit frantic. I felt bad for the servers since there wasn't a ton of room in the first place and now they had to work around people during the inquisition phase when people were walking around. I had to ask a couple times for some horseradish but in general I never wanted too long for anything. My drinks remained full..though the water had a bit of a funny pipe taste. \n\nThe show was bad. Costumes were super cheesy and the storyline very confusing. There were a ton of characters- maybe giving each table a list might help, or even name tags. Some actors were better than others but oddly enough their audience appointed actors did the stand-out job. There was very little actual show time and most of the time consisted of us having to go around and interview actors...or audience members. Which sounds more fun than it is because you wanted to enjoy your dinner. They took some cute pictures in the beginning and tried to get us to buy them for $20- but I wish they spent the money on a better production or layout. \n\nWe had fun since we came as a group, but overall half of us (and several others in the audience) left early, as it was rather disorganized and seemed to drag on. I would not pay full price, and I would not return."
3,"Okay, so several months ago I posted that our vet, Dr. Mac, was a bit judgemental about that fact that I let my cats outside during the day. I thought about leaving his practice to find a provider who was a little more in line with my own beliefs, but never really got around to it.  I am glad I didn't, and now  I am here to eat humble pie.  In the time since then, not only have the cats done several thousand dollars worth of damage to themselves when they were playing outside, but Dr. Mac always cheerfully patched them up for me (even though he was right and I was wrong.)  In fairness, I should have changed my negative review months ago, and just forgot about it.  In the meantime, he has caught some difficult diagnoses and since he knows I am a nursing student, taken every opportunity to help me learn in the process. He has always been helpful and conservative in his treatment, and all this for a fair price.  As it happens, I am moving in few weeks and might need to find someone closer to the new digs, but this guy knows his stuff and my pets would have lost their lives (all nine of them) if it weren't for Dr. Mac."
4,"Driving up to the place, you contemplate if you should have brought your bullet proof vest. You pull in, see that nothing has been touched since 1950, and fall into deep thought about the greatness that's going to enter your mouth. You look at the menu (with taped over prices) and order through the original Alexander Graham Bell phone. Can't understand what the lady is saying back to you? WHO CARES!! \n\nAll you need to do is order the BBQ Minced sandwich and a 1/4 BBQ chicken (white meat). Yeah, some people say the sandwich could have more BBQ sauce on it, but those people need to walk out onto Wilkinson with their eyes closed.\n\nYou won't find another place like this in the world, i promise...I've looked. The people that work there make this place especially unique. The guys are funny, quick, and they were shirts with holes in them.\n\nOverall, if you are in Charlotte, you better go there. Make sure you bring Cash with you because Credit Cards are not allowed."
1,"Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast."
1,"AT&T UVerse\n\nI admit I have more motivation to complain about a service than write a compliment about it. But if I were looking at changing cable/internet/phone providers I would want to know this. \n\nI have had Time Warner Cable, Charter, and AT&T UVerse. Easily, I was the least satisfied with TWC. I recently left Charter once UVerse came into our area since it has the best to offer as far as DVR, channels provided for price (including promotions such as HBO, Showtime, Big Ten Network, NFL, MLB networks, etc), and the $150 gift card for signing up. Charter is better for high def TV (AT&T you pay extra), faster Internet, and unlimited phone and fax line is free if needed. Although faster Internet that Charter advertises may be overkill, as Consumer Reports recently noted that 15mbps is the most that the average consumer needs, and I get 18mbps with UVerse, which is slower than Charter. \n\nAT&T UVerse has the worst customer service by far. Recently I have had about a month of contacting the company (via telephone and on-line chat) for problems with transferring my phone number from Charter to UVerse. Something as simple as this still has not happened. The telephone customer service agents cannot give me anything in writing (no email, letter, anything), and cannot contact Charter directly, or if they do, they ask that I call Charter (already have 3 times). AT&T Uverse customer service agents have horrible documentation of the previous communications with their customers. They also call and leave messages that are so mumbled I cannot understand them. They also promise to call back at certain times then never call back. \n\nI was also promised my first bill would be $128 + tax, and the first time activation fee of $49 would be waived. My first bill is about $168, and no one appears to be able to address this fee or find documentation of this quote (and as above, AT&T does not provide anything in writing).\n\nSo if AT&T UVerse offers you a deal that sounds too good to be true, likely it is. And hope you don't have any problems with your service, because you are likely on your own."
1,"So, we had an offer to stay at a friends house for the night and we now regret passing it up. I figured, it would be best to stay close to the airport so we didn't have to deal with the rush hour traffic. Driving in from the Denver area, I asked my girlfriend to look for a place close to the airport. She found this place on Google with very good reviews. I'm not sure why she didn't use TripAdvisor. Probably because I always tell her \""Google Knows everything\"" lol. Anyway, we arrived and were greeted by a nice young lady and the place seemed fine. The lobby area was clean. We made our way to the room, which upon first glance seemed okay. The sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean. However, as we made our way in, I noticed the musty odor that is mentioned in other reviews. I decided to look at some reviews and see if maybe we were the lucky recipient of a room that had not been renovated yet. After reading the reviews and comments from the manager, I figured this must be the case. No problem right? Sure, I called down to the front desk and said to the nice young lady \""I see in your reviews, the hotel is having some renovations done and it seems we have received one of the musty smelling rooms that hasn't been addressed yet. Do you have a room that has been renovated, that we can be moved to?\"" Her response was, \""we have been doing some renovations, however not to the rooms. I don't have a nicer room that I can move you to. Sorry.\"" Well, I said to my girlfriend, it's just one night and I don't feel like driving to another hotel. After sitting on the old, run down, uncomfortable love seat watching TV for a while, I said, we should probably move to the bed as it has to be better than this seat. So, we got ready for bed and pulled the comforter back to find sheets that must have been queen size because they definitely didn't fit this king size bed. Whatever, hey the bed has like six pillows on it and two extra in the closet. Great, not, the pillows were plentiful, however they're about half the size of a normal pillow. Okay, I'm tired of trashing the place. Have a look at the pictures (worth a thousand words.) I'm sure with some true renovations, this will be a decent place to stay. I would guess the very good reviews this place has received are the work of some reputation building company or maybe we did just receive one of the older rooms and they didn't want to relocate us. Not returning anytime soon.\n\nStayed October 2013"
2,"I had a gift card to this salon and was interested in trying it out. After much contemplation regarding which service to use my gift card on, I settled on a 30 minute massage. I called on Friday and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to fit me in on Saturday. As soon as I walked into the spa, I was offered a beverage and escorted to a comfy chair. The massage therapist was very warm and friendly. I've had some uncomfortable/awkward massages at other spas, and I felt extremely comfortable with her. Overall, the massage was great. Great pressure. She used non-fragranced oils. She didn't try to talk to me the entire time which I appreciated.\nAs I was checking out at the front desk, I asked one of the employees a few questions regarding false lashes and lash extensions which she did not know the answer to. I was disappointed that she was completely clueless regarding these services nor did she offer to ask anyone who may know the answer to this question.\nOverall, I think the massage itself was great. However, the front desk service was mildly disappointing."
2,"I was super wary about this stop because of previous reviews, but they have apparently stepped their game up... \n\nThey have a new (or at least new to me) 60 second or less service guarantee and I was definitely wondering if the \""quality\"" of the food would suffer since they were trying to move so quickly... I was very pleasantly surprised... Not only were we through the drive thru in about 60 seconds, my food was incredibly hot and fresh... Well, you know, as fresh as McDonald's is... \n\nIt was a quick trip with hot food which is what I wanted, so I was pleased..."
1,"This place is truly hit and miss... The breakfast is best here like many other reviews say here the drive thru is rediculously laid out while I've never encountered rude staff here I gotta say it's only selling point is the location,being 2 stories, and the piano is awesome but it is mcdonalds keep in mind so the food can only be so good even if it's hot and \""fresh\"" \n\nEat here at your own risk and since they close at midnight this isn't a drunk food spot"
3,"Harper's is like a more local version of TGIFridays or Applebees.  The food here is really delicious, and they offer a decent selection of typical appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees (think spinach and artichoke dip, chicken sandwiches, and steaks).  While you will have a great meal, beware- the wait can be atrocious for lunch or dinner on any given day of the week, especially the weekends."
4,"Really really really great place to eat.  Nothing is greasy, and everything tastes fresh.  Slow roast short ribs are the best I have ever tasted.  Ahi sashimi salad is a full blown meal.  Portions are very generous and prices are more than reasonable.  The restaurant is very nice too, very classy, and staff are very polite and attentive.  I also recommend the bbq salmon if they have it.  Very moist with great flavor.\n\nAlthough it looks like a cookie cutter chain, don't let the applebees look fool you.  This place is first class without being first class expensive and it totally has no snotty-ness in it.  Did I mention how good the food is?  \n\nFriends tried the filet-mignon and they said it was the best they have ever had.  Perfectly cooked just as they asked for.  This coming from a  world traveler and self proclaimed steak lover this says a lot."
1,"Let me tell you gents this place is totes av (average). Really not much to say. If you like food you'll probably be able to eat some of it here. My friends at the table insist that I rate this place as \""good average\"" but that seems meaningless. Also $2 beers of which I've had about 6."
1,This place is as bland as they get. The food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too.
2,"Typical BoA branch set up near South Park Mall.  It's located at the corner of Fairview and Barclay Downs so there is a traffic light to help you turn left and then into the parking lot.  Ample enough parking spaces and the building is shaped like a pie wedge so it makes for an interesting entrance (at the tip).\n\nA walk up ATM is located at the front for 24hr access as well as a drive thru ATM.  I've never seen anyone use the teller windows (drive through), but they may be phasing those out as the tellers are being replaced by machines."
0,"Lived there for almost 3 years, at the very back if it matters. I worked 2nd shift so coming home there were ALWAYS Police arresting people in the parking lot.  My car was almost stolen once even with an alarm on it??? Police Officer said it was probably crack heads who usually don't pay attention to alarms, he said they were rather fond of this parking lot...\n\nAlso had a cereall raplist make a guest appearance one night and try to break down the door of the single lady across from me who had just moved from Vermont or something-Imagine her Yelp story.... He was caught a month or so later which is why I'm privy to his cereal tendencies.\n\n\nWhen I first got the apt. it did seem like a good deal and figured I could put up with some things for the price. I had the black mold and other various issues as well but I was looking for a house so I was just buying time.\n\nThe reason for 1 star is the absolutely horrible customer relation skills-or lack there of. Of all the employees and especially management. Don't ever expect to get things taken care of in a timely manner and do expect attitude for even trying to get something fixed. If you ever have a problem you are seriously sol. I would check the be be be site on these guise before even attempting renting from here. \n\nEspecially for a single lady I would seriously avoid. One last thing, their maintenance guys are f;in creepy!!! I hated the fact these guys actually had a key to my apt. And I'd come home randomly and find them there for no apparent reason."
3,"I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either!"
3,"So excited I made it back to an old staple. So, I was craving a fajita, but they don't offer the lunch size portion on Sundays so I chose a lunch combo, which didn't disappoint. I chose a beef taco & chicken burrito w/ rice and beans. The taco was great, meat seasoned perfectly, hot, yet the shell held up great. The burrito was filled with all white shredded chicken, topped w/ a red sauce & cheese...a lot of cheese, yum! The chips were great, but I have to say I miss the old salsa. The new one seems to be a little more roasted, hot than what I remember. I cannot wait to get back...definitely a fajita next time :-)."
3,"I visit often.  Love the white salsa, great food, good prices."
2,"The food is better than average and affordably priced but service is extremely slow and there's no rhyme or reason as to when dishes come out of the kitchen.  They don't answer their phone any time of day and don't return calls so it's nearly impossible to make a reservation unless you happen to be willing to stop by before your dinner engagement.  \n\nBut it's a nice small restaurant for impromptu sushi dinners for couples or a party of 3 or 4.  That's probably their focal point anyway.  They do have tatami mat seating and a fairly broad, if expensive, sake selection.  \n\nI would immediately give them four or even five stars if service was a little more organized and purposeful and if the staff could be significantly friendlier.  There are only two servers even on Saturday nights during prime time, so perhaps that is the source of the problem anyway.  Be prepared for long waits during your meal if you go with a group of 5 or more."
3,"It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese. Well Musashi is one such place. The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone. Good authentic menu, service and food!"
2,"This restaurant seems actually run by Japanese people, which is rare for a Japanese restaurant in the US. It also seems to receive a good number of Japanese regulars, which is always a good sign. I see they're trying to be authentic in their food (I lived in Japan, and I can tell). \n\nAnyway, the ramen I tried, I guess you just can't make it as good as you'd get in Japan. It is pretty ordinary ramen (stuff you could make with the material you gather from an asian market without much efforts), but pricey, (not as meh and pricy as the ones I tried in St. Mark's Place in NYC though, those were absolute rip-offs and were literally cup-noodles in bowls!). \n\nThe lunch sushi plate I didn't try but I saw a sample display at the entrance --- the usual cheapie American style sushi, i.e. a bunch of makis (easy to make a bunch, easier to cheat the flavor of lower quality sashimi, not accidentally never ever seen served in restaurants in japan), fake crab meats (seriously, why would any supposedly \""authentic\"" japanese restaurant serve this crap? Why not skip the crab anything altogether if the real thing is so expensive?), etc.\n\nOK food. Really, not much better (but certainly not worse) than any other japanese or sushi restaurants in Charlotte, and the prices were OK. The Japanese regulars seems to frequent the place because they know it cannot get any better in Charlotte as far as Japanese cuisine goes (not because the food there is as good as they'd get back home). So what can you do?"
2,"So this place comes highly recommended!! It is behind my favorite Thai/Vietnamese place (Viet-Thai) and once night we thought we'd check it out.\n\nWe had a couple rolls of sushi and I had the Panko crusted Chicken and the boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken. Everything was good, but I wasn't blown away. I really wish the salad had a ginger dressing and I  may ask if they have it next time, but it has a sesame dressing. I hear they have the best Ramen in town and over half of the patrons were japanese!! That speaks volumes...  FYI he loved the place but didn't think his chicken was the best. We both agreed we'd be back to try the Ramen and Udon!!"
0,The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.
3,"Wow! A treat for your senses for sure! The moment you walk in you are greeted with colorful, beautiful, edible things!! Classical music plays while you walk through the store.\n\nIt is fun to buy a hot drink and walk around the store looking at all the gourmet items. Definitely don't go hungry or plan to eat there. They have boxed sushi, made-to-order sandwiches, hot and cold dishes, etc. \n\nThe candy and cake sections will make you stop in your tracks. The artistic decorating is something to talk about. Definitely fancy and expensive! \n\nThe items are definitely pricey, but it is such a nice experience to see beautiful food! (But I had to laugh because their stock shelves look like the wire shelves you can buy at Walmart...so the next time I looked in my pantry I said, \""Look, I have a little section of Dean and Deluca in my home.\"")"
2,"After having a bad experience and informing the management, Dean and Deluca went above and beyond in improving my perception of the market.  Way to go!"
1,"This place is ridiculously expensive, but being from out of town and I'm trying to experience all there is to the east coast I was brought here by my colleague.  I bought sugar cookies for my kids that were $5 each and I expected it to be top notch for that price, but all it was was a regular sugar cookie, of regular size, and of regular taste.  I tried the mocha they had and it was just ok (the chocolate they used wasn't really that great) and the next day I decided to give it a try with a vanilla latte instead and again it was just ok.\n\nFor the price and quality of it's products I'd probably look somewhere else."
4,This has always been awesome place on my list of places to shop or have a sandwich went recently and had a fantastic lunch.
0,"Caught them fraudulently misrepresenting a product again, scamming if you like.\n\nAll that talk about subs put me in the mood for a good NY style hero and I decided to treat myself at D &D. The board said : \""Italian Hero\"", french bread, provolone, Genoa salami, spicy cappicola (or maybe it was Brescaiola?), and PARMA prosciutto w/oil & balsamic $9.50.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was they didn't fold the meats, juts plopped them flat.\nThe second thing I noticed is there was not enough meat to fold it - which explained the first thing\nThe third thing I noticed was that I could not taste the Parma, so I take the sandwich apart and I find 1 slice of provolone, 4 of salami, two small of cappicola and one (1) slice of prosciutto, all of them super thin of course.  \n\nThat cappicola was OK, the Genoa was the domestic generic type which didn't surprise me, but what did was the Parma was NOT Parma. It was colorless, tasteless, looked like paper the sandwich was wrapped in, the cheapest of the domestic imitations IOWs. \n\nTHIS is what Parma prosciutto  looks like: bright pink : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg/640px-Prosciutto_di_Parma_-_affettato2.jpg\n\nI ate the transparent slice of prosciutto on its own and still could not taste any of it, you'd probably need a much thicker slice to get any flavor. \n\nI went back inside and checked the cold cut counter and sure enough not one of their 4 types of prosciutto on display looked anything like it. So what you get in a D&D sub is a thin portion of cheap domestic cold cuts pretending to be imported.\n\nI called the manager, he said he would talk to the chef about it (I smell bull) and refunded me. He also offered me a free lunch on the house which I turned down. I'm not looking for a freebie,  but when I buy a premium item I want to get what I paid for. Instead D&D mistook me for a sucker."
3,"On a business trip, my colleagues and I stopped at Dean & Deluca twice: the first time for lunch, the second time for wine happy hour.\n\nI had never been to a D&D, and I balked at having lunch there since my impression was that it was a fancier Starbucks, i.e., I didn't want to go broke buying a coffee and a microwaved sandwich. However my coworker raved about it and swore us two ladies would love it, so we went. \n\nI absolutely LOVED it. It is a gorgeous environment, all loaded with (admittedly overpriced) specialty food items, gourmet bakery delights, candies, cheeses, a hot food bar, a luscious salad bar - and wine. LOTS of wine. If you're a oenophile (I am not; my two companions are), then you will likely be as delighted about the wine selection as they were. I had one of their weighted salads (I selected grilled chilled shrimp, goat cheese, artichokes, sundried tomatoes - a few of my favorite things!), and it came to about $11. I thought it was insanely delicious, and for those kinds of toppings not unreasonable at all (I've bought those things separately at a regular grocery for  similar salads at-home and the cost is gargantuan). I absolutely loved their salad selection.\n\nMy companions enjoyed their sandwiches immensely (and cracked open a bottle of vino as well to enjoy). My wretched diet prevented me from sinking into one of those lovely single-serve desserts on display - but damn I was tempted.\n\nWe returned the next day for wine happy hour with the rest of the office. The wine room was packed and weren't able to accommodate our party of seven. However, a super-nice young waiter (I want to say his name was Ahmad - he had a faux hawk and lovely manners) was more than solicitous, helping us pull together several tables and chairs, and timely popping around to serve us impeccably. (My knowledge of wine and how it should be served is nonexistent, so I can't wax eloquence about it. However, I was at a table of PASSIONATE wine lovers and they raved about the two reds ordered and didn't make a peep about service so I'm guessing it had to have been very good). \n\nI'm not a wine drinker myself, so I sipped on a yummy diet cream soda (never seen the brand in a Kroger or Target myself - even the diet soda seemed exotic and fancy), and nibbled with restrained gluttony on the delicious cheese plates (rich, creamy, pungent, salty, fragrant cheese with names I can't pronounce). Prices were on the higher end, but the service and atmosphere were just so serenely luxurious that I can even forgive D&D for not carrying my top wine selection (a $5.99 bottle of Barefoot Moscato). \n\nOverall, I loved D&D. I heard that we used to have one in Cincinnati, and I'd be quite happy if they ever thought to return back to the Queen City. Probably better for my budget that they don't though..."
0,"Awful, awful property. Where to start: Don't be fooled by their front office. The minute your signature is on that lease, customer service goes to hell. These units are infested with huge roaches, overrun by english illiterate immigrants (I actually heard the front office speaking to a resident regarding their social security number being registered to a dead person), and staffed by incompetent, unhelpful, degrading and rude excuses for human beings. Issues within my first 6 months have included lost packages after being delivered to the office, music being blasted (by the clubhouse) at such loud volumes as to rattle my windows and disrupt my sleep, (it took 5 calls to the office and 3 calls to 911 to resolve that issue), blatant pedophilia (our non-English speaking neighbor regularly hides in the stairwell with binoculars to view little girls at the pool - reported to the office, nothing was done) trash strewn all over walkways, stairwells, and parking areas, (again with no action from the office), unsupervised children going run-a-muck, (the fire department was here 4 days in a row to respond to blasting fire alarms that had been set off by these delinquent miscreants, and, the office claiming it could restrict my fiancee from visiting overnight. Paying rent with a credit or debit card costs $30+. The people running this office are without a doubt the rudest, most self-serving, ignorant people I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. Do yourself a favor and keep looking. Cheers! \n\nP.S Waterford Lakes - next time, just turn the damn music down :)"
0,"While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a \""business lunch\"" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\n\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice."
1,"Wow.\n\nSo-so Chinese food for twice the price.\n\nNo wonder, it's a chain restaurant. Hey, they sell their food in the frozen food department at the grocery store, too. It might be the same quality. That may or may not be sad depending on the consumer. Is it that good from the freezer? Do they just microwave one of those bad boys in the restaurant?\n\nThe prices might be worth it for dinner but lunch? Ha. Ha. Ha.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
2,"My husband and I went grocery shopping here on a  Monday evening... bad idea. The shelves were almost bare and what was left was a mess and disorganized. This is unusual for this store, which I usually shop at. Positive for this trip was as usual the salad bar and the tomato bisque soup. A must try!"
3,"I've been wanting to try this place for sometime and Restaurant Week was a perfect time to do it!\n\nMy friends and I made reservations for 7:30, when we arrived they greeted us and said they were just waiting for our table to be cleared and to hang out at the bar until it was ready. So we headed to the bar and were seated about 10 minutes later. \n\nThe first cool thing about this place is the caricatures on the wall, there  famous and some local faces with their names and even some signature everywhere you looked! I thought this was a very cool touch!\n\nOnce seated we were presented with one of the most amazing bread baskets I've seen. But keep in mind, I'm totally a bread lover! There was a white, wheat and whole grain, sweet cinnamon and even breadsticks! It's a bread lovers dream. \n\nThe menu looked absolutely delicious, I ordered the lobster bisque, jumbo lump crab cakes and mango salsa and key lime pie for dessert.\n\nThe lobster bisque was divine! It was creamy and rich. The only thing I wanted was more lobster! Other than that it was one of the best I've tasted! But make sure they add some cracked pepper for more flavor! \n\nThe jumbo lump crab cakes were absolutely amazing.  Literally overwhelmed with crab meat...OH MY GOODNESS. I really don't have another way to describe it, they were outstanding! The mango salsa was really fresh and worked as a great compliment with the meal.\n\nThey key lime pie was great too! A great and refreshing way to end the meal. \n\nThis place was really great! Our server was wonderful and we had a lovely time. Look forward to returning!"
2,"After much anticipation, I finally made it out to Baoding...for lunch.\n\nI had the chef's special: Szechuan shrimp, chicken and beef with brown rice. It wasn't horrible, but it was bland. Very bland. I expected spicy as the description stated, but its about as spicy as a spicy chicken from Wendys. The baby corn in the dish tastes like it was just taken out of it's soaking liquid (or can) and thrown right in without being drained. It tasted very watery and has not absorbed any flavor from the gravy (and yes I know the corn won't absorb much flavor at all).\n\nSince this restaurant is highly praised, I just going to have to come back another time. Maybe for dinner and I'll just hope they won't disappoint me then too.  \n\nOn the plus side though, my fortune says, \""You will inherit money and jewelry.\"" Wait a second, hmm.... inherit? That isn't necessarily a good thing is it?"
3,"I'm a lunch patron because they're close to my workplace...\n\nWhen I go here, I'm looking for two things:  good food and quick service.  The former is always delivered, the latter, well...mostly, they do get busy.\n\nPersonally, I get the Pork Fried Rice and occasionally hot and sour soup.  Simple dishes, admittedly, but their execution is what impresses me most about Baoding.  When the plate of rice arrives, you can immediately tell that they JUST MADE IT.  No, its not some dish they made a lot of and left under a lamp.\n\nThe soup is always great.  The service is also nice."
4,"Delicious Chinese food!  I had the Trio of shrimp, scallops & chicken and all food was very fresh and wasn't salty like other Chinese restaurants.  The servers were very  polite and this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!"
3,"First time I've been here in five years and it didn't disappoint! There wasn't a lot of traffic on a Saturday which I liked... but based on the food it should have been packed! The chicken lettuce wraps were pretty good! The rest dishes were savory and well prepared (had the Kung Pao chicken and crispy orange beef). You can get white or brown rice. The crispy beef was still crispy and the orange sauce had a little bit of a kick to it... just the way I like it. \n\nThe service was nothing to write home about, but decent nonetheless. \n\nYou know its a good Chinese place when all the staff talks with a think accent :-)"
2,"Wish it had been better when I made my one and only trip.  The menu was smallish and nothing quite appealed to me.  But I know others have enjoyed it very much, maybe I am an exception.  I like the wine suggestion it was top notch.  Staff was efficient and friendly."
1,"My girl and I came here for their Sunday brunch to enjoy the seafood and hang out with new friends.  While the decor of the restaurant and the service was quite good, it's in the food category where this place was severely lacking.\n\nThe way they do their brunch is buffet style with an assortment of stations which are self serve and two manned stations, one for carving and another for omelets.  Pretty standard setup.  Along with the buffet they had unlimited tapas that could be ordered for the table.\n\nMeeting our friends there for a Sunday bite was nice.  The table was comfortable, the atmosphere up scale and everyone was generally pleasant.  That's the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars.\n\nThe buffet suffered from the one cardinal sin of any buffet type offering, the food was left out too long.  Congealed mac & cheese, sushi with crunchy rice and sausage that had been dried out from being exposed for so long.  On top of that, none of the shrimp had been cleaned.  Not the large cold shrimp with cocktail sauce or the small shrimp tossed into the omelets.  That's beyond gross and completely unacceptable for a seafood restaurant of that caliber.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather do the brunch at the Ballantyne Resort.  This place was not worth the money and with such a poor showing I won't even try them for dinner."
0,"I don't know if 1 star is right or 2, but it's pretty close.  I think it would have been an easy 2 stars if I didn't go to George's Brasserie the night after to compare this against.\n\nFirst off, the waiter was off. I don't mind that perhaps English wasn't his first language, but there are somethings that do matter.  Like getting your napkin halfway through the appetizers is a little strange.  We were needing some space on the table because me and buddies ordered a lot of food.  It took a really long time for the waiter to come by and clear the dishes  - since it was him who noted the crowded tabletop.  Also, when we got the dessert menu, it literally took him like over ten minutes to come back and get an order from us.  It's wild, but the way the waiter is will really set the tone for the evening.\n\nSecond, the food was not good.  I couldn't help but notice some post here claiming that oysters are really good.  Frankly, I'm no oyster aficionado, but after comparing with other restaurant, it was pretty weak.  In comparison to other oyster bars in the area, they were much to liquid-y. That is, they just didn't have enough substance on the whole and also, the taste wasn't really like seawater, it was more salt water than anything. Fairly disappointed in the oysters. Second, the mussel pot had a pretty good broth, but the mussels were far too small and you could easily tell that they were old/frozen.  The mussels tended to be a bit grainy and fall apart in the mouth.  The sushi was definitely standard and didn't pop out at me at all. Admittedly, the sweet'n'sour calamari or something like that was pretty good, but that's the extent of it.\n\nThird, the ambiance made me feel tired. Lights are too dim and not very crowded.\n\nYeah, I won't be coming back, sorry.  Waiter really set the tone for the night and the food didn't do anything to recover. If I want oysters/mussels, I'll go to another place.\n\ndmo out."
1,"Upstream has gone downhill, fast. While the bar ambience and feel is still awesome, the sushi in particular was extremely lacking. Spicy Tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish. California rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland. \n\nService was also not particularly good and there was a very creepy manager who put us off. \n\nIt is a shame because Upstream has been a staple of the South Park area for years, but their sushi quality is completely lacking these days. I cannot comment on the main courses as we did not have any."
0,"Gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed.  Bar service was slow, 45 minutes to get an appetizer from an inattentive waitress.  Once at our table, we watched our salads walk around the restaurant twice before the server found our table.  Waiter served the entrees and walked away, never checked to see how our meal was.  While tasty, the portions are small.\n\nUnfortunately, the best part of this restaurant is the valet service.  Don't frustrate yourself, dine elsewhere with friends."
2,Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed.   The food was good but not great or amazing.  Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted.  My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great.  We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items.  The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too.   Overall the service was very good but slow.  Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.
2,Thought we'd try Showmars; they are convenient. You place order at the counter and then find a table. Plenty tables available but every one was sticky. I don't consider a table top that holds on to you to be clean. \n\nFood was served quickly and is okay. Nothing slid off the table...
0,A very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff.
1,"Well, it's been better than it is now. \n\nI've taken shoes there for at least the last 20 years, but I'm ready to go elsewhere.\n\nI have a short left leg, so I need all of my left heels built up 3/4 inch. The last two pair didn't come out right. One squeaks and pops with each step, and the other one separated from the sole and had to be repaired. (He did fix the former once, but the squeaks returned. He just fixed the latter, nicely. Both fixes were free of additional charge.)\n\nPrices have shot up recently, quite a bit, and the guy no longer takes checks. Bring cash only.\n\nI'll probably look around for another shop for my next heel build-up."
2,"Ok I would give this place four stars, but on the outside of the store it states that there is a clearance sale and everything inside is 90 percent off and it is not.  I think that this place overcharges for piercings, if you want a piercing just go down the block to Ink Link, twenty dollars for everything all day long.  The good thing about this place is that they carry Serial Killer shirts and I love 'em.  They feature movies like Taxi Driver and Pulp Fiction.  Even though they have false advertisement outside the store, the clerks are still pretty pleasant."
1,"After being prodded and pocked by my co-workers to get a kitchen pass, I finally went to the Flying Saucer.\nI get the concept.  I appreciate the effort but come on.... shouldn't you look good in a skimpy outfit if you are going to wear one?  I did not really expect great service and that was pretty clear.  Friendly enough but the overall IQ was rather low.\nI do give a huge nod to the beer selection and for that one reason I am likely to go back."
3,"Great beer selection, great atmosphere, great bartenders. What more can I say? Perfect for someone wanting to enjoy a beer with good friends. Monday night is the night for great specials but I prefer to go the other nights of the week when The Saucer is a bit quieter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is has nothing good to say about Charlotte night life, this will certainly change your mind. Give the fresh pretzels with queso a try!"
3,"I always come here after playing a round of Par 3 golf next door.  How can you go wrong with hundreds of beers, pretty girls and descent bar food?  You can't!  Cool spot - check it out!"
2,"Great idea, good menu, service is inconsistent, prices are slightly high for beer, average for food.\n\nSo there are different aspects of this place.  First off, the menu.  Their menu is very vegetarian friendly.  Hummus, spin-art dip, soft pretzels, tater tots, pizza, cheese plates, 2 veggie sammies, some salads and a Spicy Beer Cheese Soup that I wish I had tried.  So I definitely give credit to a place that tries to be veg-friendly.\n\nI ordered the Hippie Burger (veggie patty).  It was OK.  But the thing was that it came with a side, and I asked the server if the potato salad had bacon in it.  She said no.  But the first bite had bacon in it.  So, I'll just say that I was very dissatisfied with that.\n\nWhatever, I kept trucking.  And anyways, the real reason to go to this place is the beer.  I'm sure other reviewers have gone into great detail about their gigantic beer selection, so I'll keep it short.  While the idea is great, it falls a little short.  While the size of the menu is supposed to be its selling point, its just too big!!!  And it has a lot of filler.  I noticed one reviewer who said that this is the biggest beer selection in NC.  Well, maybe, but biggest is not necessarily best (innuendo unavoidable :)  It's hard to take a lot of pride in a beer bar that has a bunch of macros and second rate micros, but (if my eyes don't deceive me) not a single saison?  And barely any lambics to speak of.  Whatever, they still have some pretty good stuff, I'm just being picky, but it seems like with a little quality control their selection could go from good to great.\n\nThis one was a little tough to rate.  Part of me wants to give it a 2 (bacon), part a 3 (atmosphere), part a 4 (beer and food menu), and part a 5 (the idea).  So take that 3 I gave it according to what you want out of this place.\n\nOh yeah, this place can be REALLY loud inside.  Like uncomfortably loud, so might want to grab seat outside if that bothers you."
3,Good food and drinks before going to a concert at the verizon wireless amphitheatre up the street. ~Cheers
2,"Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil, but this was an excessive amount. Would maybe come back but wouldnt have a burger or the potato salad again."
0,"I visited this establishment 3 times in the space of one week in June.I was not impressed the first time but I gave it a second chance as its convenient,second visit was also poor.I then visited it a third time just praying it would be at least ok,I was staying in a Hotel in the area so this was the only dining option in walking distance.The food was rubbish on all 3 occasions,each of my visits was for lunch and I would not dream of returning here in the future.Difficult to understand how the food levels are so poor as it seems to be family operated and it is well staffed but they cannot even do the simple things well like a beef sandwich.Leaving on my 3rd visit I was disgusted I was served this below average standards once again,this place seems to be reasonable busy but they can only get away with serving that crap for so long.Stay away from this restaurant its the worst I have ever been to in my 4 years of living in America! I would never usually be so critical over something but on this occasion there is just no way of avoiding it."
0,"I'm a business traveler for over 20 years, and my experience with the Charlotte, NC airport Hertz location would rate as the worst I've ever experienced. I'd confirmed various details of my agreement with Hertz's 800# but when I got to the counter (after waiting half an hour at the airport for a shuttle van that never came -- I eventually took the National shuttle and walked over to Hertz!!) the manager claimed they couldn't abide by what we'd been told and as a result our bill was almost triple the original reservation. Attempts to rectify with the manager on duty when returning the car were met with \""that's not our problem\"" and \""well, you signed the agreement.\""  It's also worth adding that I've gotten nowhere with Hertz's corporate 800# (I was left on hold for THIRTY MINUTES) and their website (no response to email submission). I've never been treated so poorly. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!"
0,"Hertz here is awful, worst I've ever seen.  50 people in line, four behind the counter.  Don't\nSeem to care...line is longer than my flight!!  Buses keep delivering people.  Could it be that it's a surprise that a lot of people show up at 2:00, wanting to pick up cars they paid for.  Cost is not worth this aggravation, I beg you to go somewhere else ....again, worst I have ever seen."
3,"Outstanding customer service! From the moment we arrived to pick up to the moment we left to head back to the airport, I cannot speak enough to the speed and customer service here.\n\nYou are immediately greeted by your own \""service associate\"" who holds the door open, walks you in, takes you to your own terminal, and works with another associate to rapidly get all the paperwork taken care of.\n\nWe were then taken to our car, and a few minutes later on our way. Same thing upon return, super quick check-out and a shuttle bus waiting to take us to the airport. It's a 5-min trip to the terminal.\n\nI've rented a lot of cars, this team was most impressive on that morning."
0,"My wife and I didn't have the best of Labor Day week ends. First her car over heats Saturday night and we have drop it off at a garage for repair. She borrows my car which decides to shred its back tire Sunday night during a raging thunderstorm and no one open to fix it because its a holiday week end,so we are now without a vehicle.\nMy wife reserves a car on line and no where on the website does it say you have to have a major credit card to rent car. Our daughter picks us up and we drive 45 minutes to the airport and wait in line only to be told when we present our debit card that we need a major credit card to rent a car. WTF!! A debit card is the same as cash and we are being turned down for a car rental???\nMy wife informed the clerk that she had used this same debit card in other cities to rent car while she was on business trips and at this point he takes a condescending attitude and told us we were not renting a car with a debit card.\nI kept my cool until the clerk starting waving my wife's debit card in our face and treating us like we were white trash because we did not have a credit card.\nAt this point both my wife and I lost it and I profanely told him what I thought of him and Enterprise care rental. My wife snatched her debit card out of his hand and we stormed out mad as hell.\nMy wife and I do not have nor care to have a major credit card. If we can not pay cash for something, we do not buy it.\nI cannot believe in todays world a company will not take a debit card for a purchase.\nIf Enterprise was the last car rental place on the face of the earth and we don't have a car, we will walk rather than rent from them!"
4,"Friendliest employees ever, and those hamburgers are fantastic!  Food quality is what I'd expect at a good sit-down restaurant."
4,"The other day someone posted a question about eating near the airport and Miguel's popped in my mind and ever since I posted my response,  I could not get it out of my mind so today was Miguel day.\nWhen you drive up it looks condemned, it's on 85 Interstate Service Rd, (exit 32 Little Rock Rd) that right there, sounds sketchy.  It's beside a closed motel, (Bates Motel reference).  This alone makes me LOVE this restaurant.  It is everything you want it to be in that off the beaten path kind of way.  They don't serve the best food, the margarita is average, service is functional, but all of it wrapped up it's like heaven."
3,"So Miquel's is definitely a perfect definition for a \""Hole in the Wall\"" but let's be honest those places clearly have the best food. \n\nAs a self proclaimed Mexican fanatic I was excited to see just what this place had to offer. \n\nWe started with the chips and salsa and they were classic. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of kick! \n\nMy friends and I ordered a little bit of everything...fajitas, shrimp quesadillas, tacos, rice and beans. \n\nEverything was delicious...and the portion sizes were perfect! Add to that good service and super reasonable prices! I'm absolutely coming back."
3,I really enjoy going to this place!!  It looks like a little hole in the wall but the food is great!  As well as the service!  It's close to my boyfriends work and that's how I found out about it!  Everyone he works with raves about their salsa!  And it is de-lish!  Every day they have lunch specials and it's very affordable.  They also have outside seating which is nice.
3,"Very basic deli. I work close so go here often. From the street this place doesn't look like much, but once you enter... Still not much. Looks very outdated with booths and a few pictures on the wall, including beer signs although they don't serve beer. \n\nThe sandwiches here are run of the mill deli sandwiches but extremely reasonably priced. They have daily specials for $3.50 for a full sub! Get a bucket of iced tea for a buck and you have lunch for under $5.00. \n\nThe service is very friendly. Most of their business is regulars and they definitely let you know it. After going just a few times they had my name and order memorized. \n\nThey are known for their \""Little Rock Special\"" which is a cheesesteak, not bad but I prefer their cold subs."
1,"This is the first and only Showmars I've visited. There are about 20 of them in the Charlotte area. Food was pretty good. I'd give it one half step-up from a burger at a fast food joint.\n\nI had a Greek Salad; the salad (especially the chicken) was tasty but the dressing was \""totally bleh\"". Thankfully the default dressing was on the side so I asked for blue cheese dressing and it was much better -- they had Ken's dressing in a package.\n\nMy dinner mates had a burger and fish and chips. All around \""OK\"". I'd not go out of my way to go again and certainly not worth a quest..."
1,I had the souvlaki and my husband had the sirloin tips. Both were completely flavorless. My husband and I both agreed that the most impressive thing about this place is that they could actually find a way to cook the flavor out of beef and onions.  The tzatziki sauce was okay same with the Greek salad.
2,"Hop Feng is a cash only Chinese carryout establishment. I thought my General Tso's Chicken was pretty good and the portion size was huge I actually was able to get close to 3 meals out of my lunch. For $7.50 I got the main dish, General Tso Chicken with a weird yellow rice ??? and a deep fried egg roll.\n\nThe decor is sort of dumpy with grease from years gone bye stuck to the walls and if you ever get a chance take a look a the thermostat in the corner. The amount of grease stuck to the thermostat is down right amazing. But you know what this place hits the spot for me every now and again. \n\nAnd I got Fortune Cookies 3 of them...And they were all very accurate!"
0,"I was told the burgers where great here......well last night we gave them a try.   I was not impressed.  We order two jumbo cheeseburgers one with fries, the other with onion rings.  The burgers where BURNT to a crisp.  All the favor of the meat was gone. On a good note the onion rings where great.   Please don't burn the burgers."
2,Visiting friends in NC and we stopped here for breakfast. At first our order was take out but then we decided to eat in. They got out order wrong but was friendly in fixing the error. The food was okay for the items that we got.
3,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place! Given its location in the middle of a residential area, its mostly a locals joint. In fact, I know quite a few people who probably eat here more than 4 times a week. The food is always great, lots of veggies and county style entrees. Not sure if this is where I would go on a diet, but needless to say, I am not. The bar is well stocked (and always cheap domestic beer specials), but not always with the most enjoyable of a crowd. But hell, who cares.  I would recommend sunday lunch specials. I'll probably be there, so say hello."
0,"ive heard nothing but good things about this restaurant from friends, neighbors and yelp....   well ill just say this was my first and last time at the sports page. first off our server acted like she could care less. second there was a pit of an avacado left in the guacamole and chips i was served. third there was a short black hair on my sandwich. fourth and final, the server brought the check but we couldnt ever get her to come back to the table i was calling out to her as i was walking to the door i decided to take the check with cash to her, she ignored me...acted like i wasnt even there...i just laid the receipt on the table with the cash and left. what a crappy restaurant...the food was mediocre at best... my boyfriends burger looked good but wasnt that great...by the way... and if i wanted to complain to a manager or something i figured there was no point...i just let it go and will never be darkening their doorstep ever again..."
0,"So, I had to play hotel switcheroo because Hyatt's rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay. I wound up here and I think I'm officially done with Choice Hotels forever. I've never had a positive experience aside from this one Econo Lodge in Walterboro, SC.\n\nThis hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants. If you want to go to a grocery store, they're all 15 minutes away. While the hotel might be convenient to some attractions, it isn't convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like McDonald's and Waffle House. Gross.\n\nThe beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square 15\"" pillows. Who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child!? It's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on. Pair the lack of comfort with the 11:00 check out and you have one unhappy guest! I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\n\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\n\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.\n\nNot recommended and officially denied going forward."
2,Great specials averaging around $7.  The portions are extra large.  Large seating area.  This is your typical quick Japanese style stir fry.  Teriyaki and Hibachi stuff!   One thing that sucks - No egg rolls!  WTF?
0,Awful awful awful!!!!  I have never experienced such RUDE nurses or doctor in my life. I will never go back here again. I'm not sure how they have received positive reviews.

2,"This is a NYC restaurant. That is a compliment and a complaint. There is no question the food is outstanding. Arguably the best in all of Charlotte and deserving of national acclaim. \n\nHere is my complaint. Have you ever dined somewhere that it spectacular and the place knows its spectacular? I have experienced this in NYC. Sort of like the honor is all mine and I should be grateful they have allowed me to dine there. Maybe it was just my experience, but there was just an air of pretentiousness. \n\nSecond. The place is way too small. This means they have to flip the tables quickly to turn a profit. I was there with a party of four. We ordered a bottle of wine and drinks. The beverages came and we had to order. We were not allowed to order our appetizers while we perused the entr\u00e9e menu drank and chatted. Nope we had to order appetizers and entrees together. The waitress saw the incredulous look on my face and explained that the entrees take a while. \n\nWell the entrees didn't take long. Sorry but after dropping over $250 I don't think I should rushed. I worked in the restaurant industry. I know that people \""park\"" themselves at their table. Trust me that was not what we did. This was an assembly line chain restaurant experience. Get'em in and get'em out. \n\nI am glad I went an experienced Chef Moffet's food. He is incredible. He needs some help on the front end. I wouldn't go back. Jim Noble restaurants are much better run and the food is on the same level."
4,"Went here on a Thursday night at the last minute. We don't get to go out much so wanted to try someplace special. We were blown away by Barrington's and can't wait to go again. \n\nFor our first course, I had the mediterranean salad and my wife had the poached pear on argula. Both were simply incredible for many reasons. First, for the creativity and composition of the ingredients such as falafel, hummus, tzaziki, etc. Second, for the quality, freshness and taste, Third, for the presentation and display. \n\nOur entrees raised the bar even higher. I had the grilled swordfish which came on a bed of capellini. My wife had the pork tenderloin on a sweet potato mash with asparagus. The flavors of both dishes had subtle spices as the hint of chipotle in the pork bbq sauce.\n\nFor dessert, we split a granny smith apple cobbler topped by a scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream. It was not too sweet or tart and was the perfect ending to the meal."
4,"this place never disappoints me. Tough to get in, reservations are a must but always delicious."
2,"This UPS store shares its main entrance with the Caribou Coffee. They are a full service mailing shop, with boxes, packing materials and yes, they ship stuff by UPS. I think they also have a mailbox system, but I wasn't really paying attention. I just wanted to drop off my pre-paid package and be on my way. The clerk was friendly and helpful and got it done pronto. If I have more UPS mailing requirements, I'll be back."
2,"Everything really is a dollar (though some things are two for a dollar). I thought I might take a browse and see what there was and I was amazed. I somehow managed to pick up $7 worth of stuff that I actually needed for my place. Stuff that would have been twice or three times the price at the local Wal-Mart.\n\nIf you're looking to save a few bucks, Dollar Tree rocks!"
2,"This is a very busy dollar store. No matter what time I go in there is always a line at the cashiers station. \n\nThis location has a good variety of merchandise, but the shelves (because they are so busy) are never fully stocked. \n\nThe employees definitely make this place 3.5 stars. I think they are always friendly, even with a line wrapped around to the door. They try their best even without a lot of extra help, and that's pretty much all you can ask for from your cashier."
2,"Sigh...to be honest, there is just no good food option in this shopping center. This Mccalister falls short just like many mccalisters. The lighting in here is kind of dark. The food...it lacks flavor. Don't come here if you want a good sandwich, which is funny because it is a deli. The typical scene you can expect is you come in, order with one of the high schooler staff up front and retrieve your food when it's ready at the counter. So-so food...ok price here for what you get."
1,"You would think fried chicken would be simple... Absolutely horrible.  A night visit only added insult to injury. 3 waitresses and still had to return one drink for lack of alcohol. If you want to shoot pool, go during the day, otherwise, stay clear!!!\nPS: I had to remind them of the \""drink\"" to get it removed from the bill."
1,"Today was only my second visit to this location. My family just moved to Charlotte in June and frequented the location where we used to live. \n\nFirst visit was great, very friendly staff and welcoming when I mentioned we were new to Charlotte. I was happy to know I would have a great place to bring my 5 yr olds toys and clothes. \n\nToday was a different story!! I realize it is a Saturday (weekends are usually busy) but there appeared to be lots of staff on hand, but not much business taking place. I was sorely disappointed and left with a bag full of items that will go to Goodwill. Once Upon a Child needs to show \""a little\"" regard for their customers and their time."
3,"Very good food and I like the atmosphere and style. Maybe it is a little 80'ish looking on the design, but who doesn't love a place where you are taken back Miami Vice and shoulder pads in your leather jacket. \nThe food is very good an I've tried a variety of things without being disappointed. Oven backed pizzas are good, shrimp and grits ok but I've had better. The baked Alaskan (I thought it was fish when my fianc\u00e9 ordered it) is a wonderful dessert but only available certain times of the year."
4,We eat at trio nearly twice a week. The menu has various different items and everything is good. I love the homemade chicken fingers and their brick oven pizzas are to die for. Trio is also very inexpensive for the quality of food that you get. Most dishes are under 12.00. The service is good as well.
2,Casual dinner with members tonight and food was great! Service was inexperienced.  Always love the location and people!
2,"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \n\nThis place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\n\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \n\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\"" Pretty much always my thought process. \n\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \n\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!"
1,"Well it's not the place it use to be. We went there for my birthday per the kids request and we had the typical experience which was a lot of banging, a lot of yelling and a lot of fire. I can understand why kids love this place, me not so much. I use to enjoy their food back in the day but now you don't get nearly the amount you use to get and what is with \""Japanese Katsup?\"" That stuff is nasty. Didn't they use to give you two sauces? I had to ask for something different and truth be told that sauce wasn't much better and the chef seemed upset with me when I told him I wasn't a fan of the Japanese Katsup. Dude get over it and go make your ring of fire.\n\n The food was MEH. Miso soup which really was chix broth with a little (and I stress little) sliced scallion and 2 thin slices of mushrooms, a salad which was Iceberg (BLEH) and their famous Ginger dressing, which I do admit, I like.\n\nThe entrees were MEH as well. I had the fillet, scallops and shrimp. My husband had the fillet and lobster. Our steaks were cooked perfectly but I think the chef was upset at the seafood because he MURDERED it. Every piece of seafood was so overcooked, it was like we had the fillet with rubber bands. I understand you want to put on a show but can you at least do it with the zucchini and leave the seafood be?\n\nThat evening my son and I had some sushi as well and I will say the fish was VERY fresh. Had I known the chef was going to incinerate my entree, I would have just stuck with the sushi."
2,"Not my favorite experience at a Japanese Steakhouse. My food was good-- not phenomenal, but good. My waiter was relatively inattentive (and spoke limited English), and thus, got my order wrong; thankfully, everything is made in front of you, so this was fixed and I enjoyed my filet and lobster as ordered. That stated, this place is just too loud (and I'm eighteen, so that says a lot), and the service feels rushed.\n\nMy suggestion? Go to the Nakato down the road."
1,"I went here with a couple of friends a while ago and honestly everything was mediocre at best. For the price, quality, and quantity there's a similar restaurant nearby that's way better. The service wasn't bad, and the presentation was typical. Just nothing special. I have no specific complaints, but nothing to brag about or remember, either."
3,"Our choice and the choice of our son's family when we want Indian food in Charlotte.\n\nExcellent food covering all the Indian traditionals such as tandoori, curries, samosas and other appetizers, breads, etc.  Portions are reasonable, along with prices.  \n\nCarry out is very normal and it is packed to stay hot for over an hour.  Sometimes we have picked up an order and could not eat it until two hours later and it was reasonably warm enough to not require reheating.\n\nSome in our family are spice sissies, so we usually order medium heat, but they can melt your inlays and challenge your tongue's survival by ordering level 5 out of 5, or even higher.  Always try a lower level before you take on the masters of spice.\n\nYou might want to order extra rice if you like rice to sop up the wonderful sauces as much as we do.  Their naan bread is excellent, thick and doughy.  Naan, rice, sauces:  what more do you need to yum up your tum?\n\nThe dining area is comfortable, romantically lighted with booths and tables, serving the same menu as take-out.  We think this would be a good first date place as well as a family dining experience.\n\nThere is a buffet lunch, but we have only used the Bombay Grille for dinner so cannot comment on lunch."
1,"Extremely dissapointing trip here. Service was average to bad. Food quality left a lot to be improved. Currys have no meat but curry. Taste wise it isn't great either. I make far better indian food at home. Meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy. Overall I don't recommend it and won't be going back at all. Oh yeah their carpets were dirty with food everywhere,seems like they don't vacuum at all or very little."
1,"Visited on a Wednesday for the lunch buffet and arrived around 1120am. When my roommate and I first got there, we were the only patrons there!  I thought perhaps we were early, but throughout our meal only one other table with two customers were there and when they left a mother and daughter came in towards the end of our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, he came to refill our waters twice.  Other than that we really didn't see him.  I was a bit disappointed in the selection. There were 3 vegetarian /vegetable options, 3 chicken options and a couple of of other things like soup, potato wedges, and rice pudding that was extremely soupy. I am a vegetarian, so I was already limited in my choices.  At one point I went back to get some more rice and the rice was never refilled, so I was literally scrapping the bowl!  I mostly ate a dish with broccoli in a tomato sauce, which was by far my most favored item on the day's buffet menu.  While I did have an enjoyable time with my roommate, my taste buds were not jumping for joy as I had previously imagined that they would.  I love Indian food, but my experience at Bombay Grille was although not horrible, was also not what I would envision as something to be repeated.\n\nNormally at buffets I can usually eat between 2-3 plates.  Their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate.  After leaving the restaurant I took a nap and very long walk afterwards, and I still was full to the point of being uncomfortable.  I am grateful that I did not have to work that day, I would have been miserable.  I even thought that possibly they put heavy cream in their food, but of course I am not in their kitchen, so that will go unknown.  Food has never made me feel that way.  \n\nKey points that I was disappointed in were:\n1. Buffets usually have a great selection, so that a person can sample several different dishes- Bombay Grille failed here.\n2. Indian buffets usually have at least one dish with paneer- Bombay Grille failed here.\n3. Indian buffets are supposed to have several different curry dishes (mild, medium, spicy and different kinds of curry). There was only one curry chicken dish.- FAIL\n4. Bombay Grille- FAILed to refill the rice.. there were only 4 people in there at any given time!!!!  I'd hate to see what the buffet would like after 20 minutes if it was packed or even half way full.\n5. Where were the spices? It's bad enough that there wasn't any good curry or paneer, but I couldn't taste any spices.  In my opinion, this is an Americanized Indian restaurant. I could not taste any pepper, cardamon, anise, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, saffron, tamarind or turmeric! -FAIL\n7. Naan- didn't taste like it was homemade.. looked and tasted like store bought and it was plain.. they didn't have garlic naan!  By the time I had some, it was cold, chewy and blah.  No ghee and naan!  No spices or raisin and naan.  NOT SATISFIED!\n6. The price for the selection. - FAIL\n\nThe decor is slightly plain.. the only redeeming quality was what I was craving for over a month since moving to Charlotte.. a Mango Lassi.\n\nOverall, I would not return to this restaurant.. the food quality, selection and price were less than stellar.  I've heard great things about \""Passage to India\"" in the University area and can't wait to check it out!"
2,"There are a couple of amazing wood sculptures in the place.  The food however, is not as noteable.\n\nThe food is average or typical of Thai cuisine.  The dishes are standard and taste and look like what thai food should, however, nothing stood out as being anything more than average.  I am wondering if I am being to critical and if yelp should have 2 rating systems.  1 rating for how a place might compare against local establishments, and another rating for the restaurant nationally.\n\nWith that in mind, of the 2 places in Charlotte I have tried for thai, this is clearly the better."
4,"They have awesome Iced Thai Tea!! ( If you haven't tried one then you should go get one) Love their dishes, which are delish! And you should tried the fried duck ( I don't remember the name, just the details) they're yummy too! And their staffs are nice too. So it a great place to go when you want any Thai foods. :)"
0,"I Specifically asked for NO MEAT of any kind.  Even made inquires about the sauces and if they had chicken broth, etc.  When I got home we found our rice had little bits of beef in it.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner.  Also the prices online were cheaper than what they charged in the store, not cool.  Certainly will not return to Quick Wok."
0,"The food is inexpensive. I was there with co workers for lunch. Service was not good and we noticed after we were done eating that there were bugs crawling on the table. When we told the checkout person that there were bugs on the table her response was \""oh they start coming out after we spray.\""  Will not go back, between the service and the bugs I am totally grossed out!"
3,"This little gem is tucked in the HT at Arboretum beside the Starbucks. It  has been around for a long time, but they are still churning out some really good quality take-out.  \n\nThe owner and his wife are very friendly and always have a smile and time for a little chit-chat. \n\nWe usually call ahead and the food is always fresh, hot, and ready to go. The portion sizes are good and there is usually enough to take the leftovers to lunch the next day.\n\nI sometimes place an order for take out while I am shopping and they get the food prepared pretty quickly.  They have great Chinese and Thai dishes!"
3,"I creepily eat here probably once every two weeks.  What can I say... there cheese fries are fabulous, and their salads are yummy.  \nI also recommend getting the No Rules Pasta with no protein (vegetarian) and sub the normal sauce for the fuego sauce.  The sauce is spicy and absolutely perfect.  \nIf you go in and there is a long wait, it is good to remember that the bar is first come, first serve.  I never wait longer than 5 minutes because I typically get a seat in the bar area.  They also do call ahead seating, a definite plus.  So if you are going on a busy, just give them a buzz as you are leaving the house. \nThe staff here and be hit or miss.  When they are good, they are GOOD and when they are bad.... let's just say I have a few that will not be my server again."
1,"I went here as a last resort after being unable to secure a table at Beef-n-Bottle, so my expectations in regards to meat quality that day were a little high.\n\nThe first thing to expect at Outback is a fairly long wait on weekends; if memory serves me correctly, the wait on a Saturday night was about 50 mins.  There is a small waiting area to the left of the door that has complimentary lemonade and they also pass out samples of appetizers.  This small space is a real life saver when it's really cold outside.\n\nRegarding the food, I recommend either the Victoria Filet or the New York strip (rare or medium rare).  Since the prices are so reasonable, you're basically looking at a $10-14 steak if you get the sirloin and based on the comments from the table next to us, a $10 piece of meat is what you're gonna get.  While we enjoyed our filet and New York strip, the couple next to us was unable to finish more than half of their sirloins.  They said that the meat was kind of tough and dry.  I personally found my strip to be tender and juicy, however it was lacking in the seasoning department, let just say I needed a lot of steak sauce.  The loaded baked potato was cooked well, but the cesar salad that I had was very bland.  The dressing had almost no taste and the parmesan cheese was bland with an odd peppery taste.\n\nThe service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  If you asked me if I'd return, I'd probably say no.  The food quality just isn't what I'm used to in the realm of steaks.  To be honest, I've had better steaks at some of Charlotte's local bars.  If you're on a limited budget and want a steak dinner for $20 or less, you can't beat the pricing here."
2,"The atmosphere here is comfortable and attractive.  The service is above average.  The lunch specials are quite appealing, and the food itself is pretty tasty."
2,"I went to Salsa's/Cabo's for the Sunday Brunch Buffet.  The fresh-made tortillas were wonderful and the service was excellent, but the food was just ok for me.   There was a good selection of items and everything was tasty, but some items were a bit too salty for my taste.   I may give it another try."
2,"Good place to go if you are in a bind for some sporting goods.  Pretty have a little bit of everything... but \""jack of all traits.... master of none\"" applies here.   These sporting good stores are usually fairly large with a bunch of sections for any sport you and your family are interested in.  There are a couple of Dick's stores that have a better selection in running shoes (Southpark) and are deemed \""shoe specialty locations\"", sadly this is not one of them, but they do have a lot of selection.\n\nOn my recent trip in, I was looking for some KT tape and got what I needed.  The color selection was a bit sparse, but the price was right.... the location of what I needed was a little hard to navigate so I did spend some time in the store wandering around like a lost puppy. \n\nUsually someone greets you right away when you come in and people are pretty helpful in trying to \""get you in and out\"", but the last trip I couldn't really find anyone to help me.  \n\nAs a side note, this shopping center has been pretty eerie to visit since Walmart and BestBuy has since relocated.  It doesn't seem that busy, but at least the Dick's has the Guitar Center as a neighbor still."
0,"I hate Bank of America more than anything else in the world.  I am a peaceful person who would rather cut off my left arm than offend anyone or get into a fight.  But, I swear, B of A brings out a side of me that I wish I never had to see, and the unfortunate part is that I usually end up taking it out on the unsuspecting customer service rep on the other end of the phone line.  I have never in my life banked with a company that goes so far out of their way to screw people over and assess unnecessary fees.  I have paid B of A hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees over the last year due to their screwed up system and logic that they will undoubtedly try to convince you is somehow appropriate.  For example, I made a charge to Food Lion using my debit card and my pin number, which means that charge should come through on my account IMMEDIATELY.  Instead, it didn't come out for two days, on the same day as an automatic withdrawal for a student loan payment.  The financial geniuses at this corporate mega-money factory decided that since they waited for two days to take it out, now they would take the debits out from largest to smallest, with no regard for the date and/or method of payment used.  So, in a nutshell, I was charged two, count 'em two, overdraft fees and when I spoke to customer service, they simply read the policy out of their little manual, attempting to explain it to me like I have an IQ of 50 with no offer to make the situation better even when I threatened to close my account.  Bottom line:  they don't care about me, my money, my life, or my circumstances.  All they care about is whether or not I'm stupid enough to continue paying them overdraft fees.  I closed my account and switched to a smaller credit union and I couldn't be happier with my decision."
2,"Like K.B. said, its pretty standard mexican food.  I thought the salsa before the meal was too watery.  I had the fish tacos.  The fish was fried.  This place is ok if your in the area and hungry.  You won't be thrilled or disappointed."
1,I haven't been back here in years. The food is mediocre at best. Head to Monterrey's.
4,"My very first review could only be that of Zapatas Cantina, or \""Zaps\"" as I like to refer to it as.\n\nI frequent this dining establishment more than any other in my life. Very much at the pinnacle of decent restaurants located in the university vicinity of Charlotte, it has all the ingredients: the food is of upper-end quality, it's modestly priced, and has a fresh atmosphere. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a place with a staff that can understand and replicate English well- this place is not for you. I've heard various people toss that comment around every now and then. It may just be my opinion, but it seems as though the best authentic, non-American eateries are those with misplaced English skills, or a complete lack thereof. \n\nNow I myself usually don't deviate from an ace menu item once I've found it, and as such I've had the same \""Southwest Quesadilla\"" from Zaps for the past 6 years. First thing I've ever ordered from 'em. Think I care? Nah. Sure don't. I have only recently been \""around the block\"" with other various items on the menu and to no shock whatsoever, find them all exquisite as well.\n\nOverall, here are a few things to consider about the business: 1) Adequate spacial constraints with an up and downstairs, each consisting of its own outdoor section, 2) lakeside view, 3) great food/ menu combinations & a plethora of menu items from a very basic \""kids\"" to a \""make-your-own\"" spin off anything they have to offer really, 4) generous portion sizes, 5) full bar selection and quality margaritas, 6) drink specials for every day of the week, 7) VERY quick service (9 out of 10). Can't beat it.\n\nAnd for Cinco de Mayo? This is the place to be."

2,"Met someone here to play on the tennis courts.  Surprisingly the courts were in good shape, the nets were missing the straps, but we played through it.  Overall it's a nice complex.... my one complaint would be that the parking lot is a bit of a maze to get out with a lot of curves (which means a lot of blind spots if you are backing out).  Yes, it keeps the place looking interesting, but I would hate to be a grounds keeper here since there are no straight lines in sight.\n\nThe apartments look pretty solid, all-brink.... there is a lot of highway noise coming from 485 though.... I didn't go inside one unit, but it was fairly loud from the tennis court."
3,"We found this place off of Yelp and after reviewing the reviews my husband and I decided to try it out. We went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the food and atmosphere was awesome. I do not recommend to take small children. The atmosphere was very romantic with dim lighting and they had someone to play live music on the accordion.\n\nI ordered the house special which was the Whiskey Shrimp and Chicken. This dish was so good, it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the Bake Zitti which was great as well. For both of our meals plus wine and a few beers we paid an average of 60+ bucks. \n\nWe will definitely go back again with friends and family."
0,"I was a loyal customer of this Discount Tire up until this week. They replaced a wheel for me in 2013 following a car accident. They offered me a hubcap, but I wanted it to match the others, so I was very explicit with them that I would be purchasing a factory hubcap. When I purchased the first hubcap off ebay, it didn't fit properly on the wheel, and I assumed I had purchased the wrong hubcap by mistake.\n\nIn May, when GM recalled my car, I ordered a factory hubcap through my dealer to make sure it was right this time. When that one didn't fit, I realized the wheel was the problem. When I called Discount Tire, they said of course it doesn't fit, you have one of our stock wheels on. Had it been explained to me that the wheel wouldn't fit the hubcap I was VERY clear that I wanted, I never would have purchased it!\n\nThey assured me this would be fixed, and that they would not only order me the correct wheel, but would take off the cost of the wheel I had already purchased. I gave them a month, and called back to inquire as to the status of my order. They explained that they  had placed the order, but since they ordered it from the factory, they were waiting on GM to ship it. I got the same story again in July, and August. When I called again this month, I was told that they didn't have an order for me out at all, there was no note on my account about any of this, and they had no idea what I was talking about. I either fell through the cracks, or someone decided I simply wasn't worth the trouble or the money I had spent there.\n\nI am livid, and will never give this location another dime. I contacted another discount tire, and they got me a new wheel by the next business day, no hassle!"
2,"Sports bars are generally a dime a dozen and this Stool Pigeons ranks above average (for sports bar) for food, cleanliness, and a decent atmosphere. I'm not a sports fan, so I mostly go to these places for food and  fellowship, both of which are a good bet at Stool Pigeons.\n\nI agree with Devin that Stool Pigeons is less crowded than comparable establishments, I've never had trouble getting a seat here. While the food is unoriginal pub fare, its cheap, filling, and pretty tasty.  No entree is more than $9.  In fact, the sandwhich and fries was a mere $7!  Our server was quick and friendly.  She got my sandwich right, down to the toppings and never wrote my order down...impressive.  \n\nWhile this is a bar, there is sufficient seating away from the bar for non-barflies who want to have a conversation.  I would even wager that the new non-smoking laws have made these sports bars downright pleasant!  Oh yeah, I'll be back!!!"
2,"stayed here for 3 nights, and is our company preferred hotel. the interior was modern, and the employees were very friendly and helpful. i checked in during the late night, and immediately asked for a refrigerator. it was brought up promptly (i could hear her asking him as i was walking back to my floor through a walkie-talkie). room service food here is bleh. i ordered the tomato basil soup (he gave me a large side since i didn't get the grilled cheese that it normally comes with) and it wasn't even WARM! waste of $7. the pesto chicken panini would've been good (it was a bit odd since it also had asparagus) but the bread was totally burned. the fries were good, and they forgot my ranch, but he came up with 2 right away after i called.\n\nmy favorite part of this hotel is that it faces the man made lake, which is a great view for me to enjoy while on the terrace in front of their bar/restaurant. weather was great this week, and enjoyed a lot of nights with the breeze with some bubbly & wine. its also within walking distance to some shops and restaurants, and was able to burn off that southern food walking laps around the lake. also nice to see ducks, swans, etc.\n\nthe room - it was standard size, although i was at the very end around a corner. the ice machine didnt work on our floor, but i was tired of asking for things. :) the bed was comfy, but not as comfy as i thought it would be considering it was \""pillowtop\"". the worst were the pillows. they were all goose/feather down, and even with 2, i was so uncomfortable as my head sunk into them. i also couldnt turn off the fan, and im such a light sleeper that i could not sleep well the first 2 days because it was so incredibly loud.\n\ntheir basic tv channels are all fuzzy, i am not sure why, so that was annoying. their alarm clock, you can't change the hour, so i always used the wakeup call service, which never failed.\n\nwe also received a free full breakfast buffet, and there was a variety of things (same everyday). biscuits/gravy (delicious!), bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, grits, cereal, yogurt, and we always opted for the make your own omelette station. it was great, except for the 2nd day when i asked for egg whites and got the regular eggs. oh well. great service other than that.\n\nwould stay again for the convenience factor, as they have a shuttle service to our office (5 minute ride)."
1,"Qdoba is something like a Mexican \""Subway\"".  You come in at one end, look at a menu board of choices - mostly consisting of a variety of burrito choices - and place your order.  The primary difference is that no matter what you order off the board, the restaurant operates more like a traditional deli and prices based on what you order, not necessarily what is on the board.\r\n\r\nWhere a Subway (most fast food places, for that matter) would have particular menu items, at Qdoba you essentially choose what you want and it is priced accordingly - and a number of the items on the menu are simply common configurations of what people may typically order if they put things together on their own.  I think it may be less confusing to some if the menu boards were simplified to reflect this.\r\n\r\nAs to the food, it's pretty decent.  You get a good-sized helping, and the price isn't out of line with what you would pay at other fast food places.  If you are so inclined, you can eat part of your meal and save the rest for later, which makes it an even better deal.  It certainly isn't authentic Mexican, but it's not bad eats when you're pressed for time."
0,"I am new to the area and visited this CVS for the first time to pick up a prescription.  I WILL NOT be returning.  First, I waited in line for 10 minutes to pick up the script- there was one person at the counter and two other people ahead of me.  When I finally got to the counter, the script wasn't ready even though it had been called in over an hour before I arrived (what's the hold-up?).  The Pharmacy Technician yelled for them to expedite it (great!) and told me to have a seat while they finished filling the script.  Ok.  I sat and listened... and listened... after 10 minutes I asked another Pharm Tech approximately how long it would be until my script was ready.  He looked and told me it was ready.  I asked why nobody had called me and he said he didn't know.  I got back in line again to check out... this time there were five people ahead of me.  After waiting another 15 minutes there's finally only one person ahead of me... the lady at the counter has a cart load of items and the Pharm Tech asks if she'd like to pay for her items there.  I can't say I blame the customer- if I had other items, I wouldn't want to wait in another line, but seriously, there's quite a line of people who can't check out up front at the general registers- let's serve the people to need to use the pharmacy.  She checks out and then proceeds to question the price of baby-wipes (buy one get one half off that didn't ring out as such).  So now the only person checking people out at the Pharmacy is doing a price check for baby-wipes while the rest of us continue to wait.  Finally, a second Tech arrives and takes the woman in front of me and then takes me.  I explain to him my frustrations as it has taken me over 30 minutes to pick up my script and that NOBODY called me when the script was ready.  The Pharmacy Manager tells me that she did call me and I didn't hear her.  I told her I was sitting in the chairs and nobody called her.  She proceeds to say she speaks fast and I probably didn't understand her.  I'm from New York- we don't know how to speak anything except fast- don't insult me!  I continued to explain my frustrations- having to wait in line twice, nobody telling me the script was ready, etc.  She asked how she could address the situation but at that point there was nothing they could do- I had already spent nearly 40 minutes picking up a script that the doctor had called in over an hour before I even arrived.  At this point, I just wanted to get out.  As I left, another customer told me how rude  I was and that I needed to be more patient!  Haha!  Mind your own business- I don't have time to spend 40 minutes picking up a prescription!  When I got home, I was told that CVS has called to say the script was ready- yup, even though I was sitting less than five feet from the counter, they called HOME rather than me!  This pharmacy needs a lesson in customer service and efficiency because both were seriously awful.  I mentioned that I am new to the area- I recently relocated from Chicago and always used CVS there.  My doctor would call in a script and within 10 minutes, the CVS would have it filled (the time it would take me to walk the 2 blocks from my doctor's office to the CVS).  The couple times the CVS was backlogged, they'd have me take a seat but as soon as the prescription was ready, they'd call me up and check me out immediately- I NEVER had to wait in line TWICE!!!  I always had such wonderful experiences at the CVS in Chicago but will definitely not be using this CVS again.  There are several Walgreens and Rite Aids in the area- I'll be using them from now on."
0,"Broccoli and meat with the taste of freezer burn always get the one star from me. Bad service gets the same. Little or no working heat (or so it seems) on a cold day is another turnoff. \n\nIf you long for the Friday's experience of the 1980s, don't go to this one. The Friday's at Concord Mills Mall gets about three stars compared to this location.\n\nAt the same time, this chain is past its prime. With so many great restaurants in this area, the only reason someone would stop here is the expectation of name recognition.  Sorry, but this site may disappoint."
1,"We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service. \n\nAs for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat. \n\nTo top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there. \n\nEating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there. Nor do I really plan on going anytime soon"
1,"Went to this Applebee's location two times. The first time was a few years back, and the bartender had terrible customer service (I'm not sure if she still works there, but I think it's worth noting). The second time I went, my girlfriend specifically asked for no onions on her sliders, and they came out with onions anyway. Also, my second round of sangria tasted like the bartender poured half a bottle of what ever they use to sweeten it, and barely any wine. I'll stick to the location by concord mills mall"
3,"A warm fall day. Sun is shining. A slight breeze...\n\nTo the Wine Vault! They have a vast collection to choose from. By the bottle or glass. And great outdoor seating to take in the fresh air. They don't have a kitchen, but have some pretty good munchies. \n\nIf you don't like wine, they do have bottled beer in the back. Seasonal selection too.\n\nA nice atmosphere but a little pricey. But with good company, it can be very enjoyable. \n\nTip: wed 7pm tastings.."
0,"Terrible \""hostess\"" experience. Woman at the front had a terrible attitude as soon as I walked on. The store is basically empty and I've been waiting for 40mins when I was told my wait time would be 15mins.\n\nAdd On: \n\nThis is my fourth time coming back due to inventory and no fault of the stores. I'm continued to be so disappointed by the \""hostess\"". They really act like you're an inconvenience. Will probably be my last trip and just drive an hour and a half to go to my home store. Really disappointed. This is not the experience I'm accustomed to receiving from verizon."
2,I liked it bc of the coupons but it is now closed they informed me by email.
2,This is a decent hotel.  I'm not sure what the real rate is but its definitely a good deal at the corporate rate I got.  It reminds of me a courtyard in many ways.  Its clean and has a standard hotel feel.\n\nThe staff was really friendly.  AND I really liked how they automatically enrolled me in their hotel points program.   Not sure I'm staying here again as I'm already a member of another program....but it never hurts to pick up more points.\n\nFree Wifi and HBO in the rooms is a plus as well.  It located near some restaurants in walking distance and its off the main road which helps with the noise.
3,Good subs and cheesesteaks. Slammed at lunch. Clean. Plentiful parking.
4,"This is my favorite NPR affiliated station....EVER. \n\nI know. Charlotte Talks can be smug. I hate People's Pharmacy. My God- what is Says You?? However, the rest of the programming is top of the line stuff. You might think this is normal. Go on a road trip and listen to other stations. They play too much Jazz. They have NO local programming (as much as I complain about Mike Collins being smug- it is excellent to have a local program like it and I'm starting to not mind it)\n\nKeep doing what you are doing because you make me so happy on my way to work and on my way home. I also listen to you on the weekends. I have been a sucker for NPR since I was a little girl. I know a good stations and this is one of them. \n\nThis is starting to sound like an awkward love letter.\n\nI don't even mind the fundraising. You have to make money somehow. The whole line about paying for a magazine subscription or cable TV always gets me....."
2,"Just went for sushi. Superman roll was good. Overall I would prefer Pisces or Ru Sans, but this place was nearby and it did the job. Service was also good although it wasn't busy at the time."
4,"Sam's, my go to store your snacks, awesome find s, and bulk items! The prices are pretty good. I get certain things and I get out, before I spend unnecessary money. That is very easy to do! Its kind of like a larger Walmart, and a foodies paradise! If you haven't been. GO NOW! ENJOY! \n\nOh, by the way, their pizza is delicious at the hot bar, up front, and they sell whole pizzas hot at the bar, and slices. In the  deli area in the back, they sell the same whole pizzas, except they are cold."
0,"Terrible. Ugly d\u00e9cor, bad food, poor service."
0,"This was by far the worse MG I have dined. All 5 entrees (big family) ordered were served cold. Not warm, not luke warm, COLD! After being re-heated undoubtedly in a microwave we discovered that each guess was discussing who had the more bland tasting dish. We have always enjoyed MG and it was a complete shock to have this type of experience. We will not return.  There were 2 exceptions to this tastless cold meal....the house salad dressing and the bread."
1,"I hadn't been to a Macaroni Grill in a number of years. I most likely won't be back to one for a very long time. Unlike other reviews, the service was actually very good, except for the copious amount of perfume our waitress bathed in. Very off-putting when so much of taste depends on smell. The food came out quickly but was still warm at best. I got the chicken scallopini and it was ok, other than the lack of heat. My wife got Mama's Trio. She didn't really care for any of it. I tried it and agree that none of it was very good, and also lukewarm.  The saving grace was that was that we had a gift card and didn't have to waste too much of our own money. If there is a next time, we'll re-gift it."
0,The worst Macaroni Grill I've ever been to!  Do not waste your time!!!
2,"So we decided to celebrate our son's excellent grades with a dinner out. Mac Grille seemed a nicer choice than others so we stopped by. We made sure to get there early to avoid the crowds.  The problem was that Mac Grille seems to schedule wait staff very thinly at the beginning of the evening. So our waitress was the hostess! She didn't know much past where to seat us but gave her all in the attempt until the overloaded waitress stopped by to take over.  Despite it, both the hostess and the waitress were very pleasant and professional throughout. Shame on Mac Grille for understaffing though.\n\nTo the food! Meh.\n\nMy wife had something called Carmela's Chicken. It was a nice looking bowl of rigatoni, chicken, mushrooms and other assorted goodies. She seemed to enjoy it but I found it to be fairly ordinary. As a guy who cooks professionally, I am always looking to be blown away with flavor or at the very least something that I didn't think to make at home. It could have used a little salt (especially in the pasta boiling water) to bring out the nice semolina taste in the noodles. The important thing is that she liked it and was happy.\n\nI got Mama's Combo. A plate with lasagna, chicken parm and a chicken and mushroom cannelloni. The cannelloni was pretty good the lasagna was the star of the plate but the chicken parm was a pure throw away. I was unaware of where on the chicken a round disc of breast meat comes from (probably right nest to the nugget!). If I was to bet my last dollar on something to regain my vast fortune I would place it on the fact that the chicken came straight out of a box, already breaded and cooked and flash heated and put on the angle hair. Very disappointed. Did really enjoy the lasagna bolognese, though.\n\nSo, who knows, maybe one day we go back, but honestly I don't think we will feel on our deathbeds that we missed out on anything special if we never stop by again. Shame.\n\nAlso, just FYI, they were out of 2 of the 4 tap beers walking into a Friday night! Who does that? May as well run out of parmesan cheese! Oh yeah speaking of parmesan cheese, I hate restaurants that have the server put the parm on your food in those grinders. Seems like if you like a lot of parm on your grub (like all of us) you are screwing it up for the other tables, so you allow them to leave too darned soon and you are left wanting more but felling a bit shy and embarrassed to ask them to come back and pile on some more. Just sayin.\n\nEat Well!!!!!!\nV-Dub"
0,Probably the driest and most tasteless chicken salad I've had in a long time. Our other sandwiches were just as disappointing. Just another chain food restaurant. I long for a real deli in Charlotte!
3,"Surprisingly, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious!\n\nGrilled Chicken Salad - good enough\n\nSpud Max - great! I would definitely get this again.  The Spud Max includes: bacon, cheddar cheese, scallions, and ham.  Add sour cream, and I am in heaven!"
3,"Ever since my office moved up to the University area, this is my \""go to\"" Y during the week.  Even though I missed the convenience of the Y's downtown - Childress & Dowd, this one is a good replacement and it saves me from driving downtown for a workout.\n\nRecently I have picked up swimming in the mornings before work... well it's better described as \""systematic drowning\"".  The pool lifeguard is super friendly.  She was even giving me tips on my form.  If I think about it more I think she was \""concerned\"" about me so... hence the tips.  I've got a ways to go before I am Michael Phelps, but I am glad the Univ City Y is helping me on my way to the Olympics (j/k).\n\nThis Y is as large as the other branches in the area and has lots of family programs - after school care, etc that you can take advantage of while getting your burn on.  Every thing is kept clean and maintained - the staff is there for you when you need them.\n\nThe parking lot leaves a little to be wanted, but it is functional (if people follow the one way signs).  At least the Y is off of a side street (not directly on WT Harris), but you have to time it right less you get caught in the traffic nightmare that happens there every rush hour twice a day."
0,"My wife and I brought our animals here for over 10 years, even after moving to Stallings, we would still drive all that way. Recently after our oldest rescue passed away, we decided to find a new vet mostly because we had noticed that ever since becoming a \""VCA\"" animal hospital, the prices have sky-rocketed, and the service has dropped significantly. \n\nWhen I say the prices are ridiculous, they are literally double for most basic procedures that you can get done at any vet office. If the prices are going to be that high, I would expect the service to match what I am paying, and that is certainly not the case. We always felt pressured into very high priced procedures, that when we turned down because of price, were snubbed off and looked down upon by the Dr and/or Tech.  That does not stand true for everyone working in the office, but the great majority. \n\nI can truly say I believe this office cares more about money than they do about any living being, animal or human. \n\nTo top it off, and this is what pushed me to finally write this review, is a few days ago I got an advertisement for dog teeth care in the mail from VCA. On the front page in big bold letters is \""  You can't get dentures for Peanut\""      Peanut being the name of my deceased dog, who passed more than a month ago!!! As I am sure most dog owners can relate, they become a part of our family, and after 13 years, a part of you. With the passing still raw in the family with my wife and daughter, seeing our dead dogs name, being used in an advertisement, without our permission was disgusting. \n\nThe response from Stoney Creek???     Sorry that was sent from our corporate office in California, must have been done before our records updated.   I don't want your excuse of corporate sending something, when we started coming here there was no \""corporate\"" in California.\n\nAll VCA cares about, yes they are known to me now as just VCA, the Stoney Creek we went to does not exist anymore,  is the money.\n\n Find a consistent vet, one who knows your animals, and is not trying to rip your wallet out of your pocket the entire visit."
0,"I give this place zero stars.  I went in for a pedicure and not only did I wait for about 10 minutes (with my feet in the water) for the girl to finish eating her lunch, she cut the hell out of my cuticle.  It took over 15 minutes to stop the bleeding and then when I asked to be comped for it, all they have me was $2 off.  I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone, even my worst enemy.  I know I will never be back here."
0,I don't even have the words!  Don't even have an app to order if you send an update that the food is out for delivery but I have to call every 20 min wondering where it is
2,"Our original intention was to go to Texas Land and Cattle, but apparently it has closed down. We headed off down Harris Boulevard in search of something else to satisfy a desire for steak. Since I-85 is such a hassle with rush-hour traffic and now all that construction, we decided not to endure more of that and not trek further for a Texas Roadhouse steak. Passing the highway on-ramp, we remembered Longhorn's existed. I used to live in the area and had been a there a few times before, years and years ago.\n\nWe both ordered steaks, my friend the NY Strip and I -- my preferred cut -- the ribeye. We got our drinks and bread the same time as the side salads. My tea was a bit bitter, the side salad was decent but bland. I prefer other place's blue cheese dressing to Longhorn's. This place's was a bit watered down.\n\nThe steak and potato arrived after we finished the salads. My friend enjoyed his, and I thought mine was fine. It was a bit tough and chewy, but not enough to send back. I finished it all and was fairly satisfied and definitely full.\n\nEveryone has their preferences, and for about the same price, I prefer Texas Roadhouse. They are more tender and juicy in my opinion, as well as thicker and more marbled. I like their tea much better (less bitter and more sweet) and their side salads (dressing there is thicker with less iceberg lettuce). They serve rolls instead of sliced bread, which i also prefer. So, I guess maybe is all down to preference, and I prefer Texas Roadhouse.\n\nAs for the service, that was a-okay. No problems there, minus the urge to up-sell, which I find quite annoying, but I accept it is a part of eating out. Our server was quick on the refills and checked in to make sure the meals was (as she put it), \""okay.\""\n\nAs the star rating and the server said, it was all \""okay.\"" Not a place I would return to unless it was someone else's idea and they had the desire for it. Also, my friend paid, so it's tough to beat that."
1,"First, the cost for the oil change was too high; at least twice what I would normally pay at the dealership for the same work... oh wait it wasn't the same work.\n\nThey cleaned my glass with a dirty rag, didn't really vacuum the interior all that well, topped off all my fluids by spraying most of them (including the oil) onto the engine bay, side, and front of the vehicle and failed to close the air filter canister correctly.\n\nHowever, most troublesome is that they didn't bother to pull the skid plate on my 4Runner to access the filter correctly. That is a big job for a shop like this I suspect. \n\nI would have been happy for them to explain that they don't normally pull skid plates and offer me the oil change at a lower price (without filter change), but they didn't. So, now I have a skid plate full of oil leaking all over my driveway and I have to pull the plate and fix their inability to be professional."
4,This has been a great experience for my kids. Sean and his staff are amazing. Can't say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kids.
3,I made it to the top- that's all that matters!\n\nLove this place.
2,"This is for the Indian Trail location, which is sadly not up on Yelp as of yet.\n\nI usually hate chain pizza places, just hate 'em. It's not real pizza. Pizza Hut, Papa John's, and Dominos are THE worst and sadly the most popular. Ever since Li'l Ceasars made a return to the area, but they've gone downhill in the quality department....either that or I was really just a dumb teenager who didn't know any better. (Hey, Godfathers was great back in the day, too!...I think.) Cici's isn't \""pizza\"" like Taco Bell isn't \""Mexican\"", so don't even bring that up. It's just garbage. Donato's is okay, just pricey.\n\nThere are better pizzas to be found in the area, but this review is for \""chain restaurant\"" pizza and Hungy Howie's is probably the best. It reminds me of the pizza Little Ceasars made back in the day. It's fast, it's cheap, and it's pretty damn tasty. It's gotta be the crust...the garlic-butter crust. I've tried their other flavored crusts but this one can't be beat. This is one of the only chain joint that knows how to properly cook their pepperoni. The edges of the pepperoni get that little bit of char around the rim. Deeelicious!\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
3,"Just had a GREaT experience here... I was yelled at, cursed at, watched ppl get punched, and had a very good cheeseburger at the same time. It was a lot of fun. The burger was really good for a grill & the homemade chips were off the charts! The grill was filled with men who enjoyed being yelled at by the female owner! Good times & good food! Don't take young kids"
1,"Don't you love it when you have to beg the restaurant to put food out on a buffet? Whenever I go here, the place is decently busy but they always seem to have a problem with having enough food out on their buffet. Everytime a tray of food is brought out, it's such a tiny portion that its usually emptied out within seconds by all the hungry customers! If you're going to run a buffet and expect people to come back, AT LEAST have enough food there for your paying customers!"
2,"We were originally going to cook Friday night, but it got late by the time we were heading home, so I decided to pick up some food from China Town on the way.  \n\nI went in and there were two people actually eating at the restaurant, the rest were in line or waiting for their take out.  It seems like that is the thing there as the phone was constantly ringing for more orders.  They had a buffet, but I'm not sure when it is set up as it was not during the time I went, which shocks me with it being a Friday night. \n\nI ordered my normal, you got it, sesame chicken.  Also ordered beef and broccoli.  With the number of people waiting and the calls coming in, the order was ready in 5 minutes.  That's great, but should that be questionable???  Maybe the whole Americanized Chinese part.  Both entrees were good and I like that they had a little extra sauce for putting on rice. They also made for good leftovers - not dried out!\n\nI would go back here for convenience, but I still have some other Chinese places that I just like a lot more, so I will reserve those for the 4 and 5 stars."
2,"So the big question since we moved down to Charlotte has been, Where the heck can we find a good bagel and slice of pizza? Someone told me that Einstein bagels has bagels that taste just like New York bagels, so I checked them out. Sadly, I was misled. Although, I must say, they were the closest I've found so far. I ordered a honey-wheat bagel and it tasted very fresh, it was still hot and soft. Put a little of their garden veggie cream cheese and I was good to go. Their cream cheese was VERY good, it wasn't as thick as most are and they didn't glop on enough for 4 bagels onto my one bagel. It was very light tasting, almost like hummus. YUM! If this is as close as it's going to get to a NY bagel, I'll take it."
3,I was down in Charlotte on business for five days and I ate here four of those days for lunch.  NEED I SAY MORE?
3,"Great lunch spot. To repeat other reviews, the service is fast; probably the quickest I have ever experienced. As with most other locations I have visited, the staff is genuine and friendly."
2,"4 stars for the service, 2 stars for the taste.\n\nThe big wasn't that big, it was normal size to me.  Lots of choices for one price, which was awesome.  6 different meats, lots of topping choices.  And yea, the service was really good.\n\nThe taste?  Just not there.  The rice wasn't flavorful, the steak had a hint of flavor even though they were generous with it...I didn't put sour cream/cheese on there, but they are generally masking agents - what doesn't taste good with those 2 ingredients????"
0,"Not good! Really, not good. I had lunch here. I was so disappointed. The crab rangoon, had no crab, just a scant amount of filling.  My lunch consisteted of a neon orange rice. Strange looking, and bad tasting. The food was so bad, I thought we were being pranked."
0,"Bojangles has always been our favorite \""greasy spoon\"" for the occasional weekend breakfast when we are feeling too lazy to cook.  Unfortunately, while Bojangles is known throughout the South for their legendary biscuits, the Tega Cay location is better known in my household for their legendary order inaccuracy.  I've been here probably a dozen time, and would posit that my order has put together incorrectly on 75% of those occasions.\n\nToday was the final straw.  After having to return to the drive thru window a second time to place a second order for the items that had mysteriously been left off the first, I was lucky enough to get the manager at the window.  When confronted by their mistake and their impressive streak of screwed up orders, she simply shrugged, smiled and said she was sorry and hoped that I had a \""nice day.\""  Ever seen the \""buh-bye\"" airline episode on SNL?  I felt like I just lived it.\n\nToo bad.  The biscuits really are amazing.  Lucky for me, there are other locations to choose from... that I will probably be visiting from here forward!"
2,"I hadn't had Papa John's for at least a year.  It's one of the better chain pizza places, and unlike the Domino's that moved, it's conveniently on my way home from work.  I got a $10 gift card for $5 from www.saveology.com and they had their large specialty pizzas for $11.  The large is only 14\"" which isn't really large, but the Spinach Alfredo pizza is pretty tasty.  I was disappointed they no longer put the butter sauce and pepporncini in the pizza box, but I understand it.  The service was a little slow as they have two registers but only one person working on one of them with a lot of people standing around.  I'd stop here for a pizza on my way home again if the price was right."
0,Two words.  Dirty and nasty. Better off driving 3 miles to the Steele creek McDonalds!
1,"My friends and I always meet up here when I am visiting from out of town. The service is usually mediocre but last night was absolutely terrible. One of my friends got there first and a soon a he sat down at the table in the bar area he was presented by the blonde female bartender with a $150.00 tab. He politely told the girl this wasn't his tab and she proceeded to literally scream at him and fly off the handle.  Luckily the tab owners had just stepped outside for a moment, but from that moment on we had the most terrible service from her. I ordered a margarita and it was disgusting with nothing but mixer and a few cubes of ice. The guys were ordering beers and they literally had to approach the bartender at the bar for two different rounds of beer because the bartender would not return to service our table like she was servicing the rest of them. We had to ask for menus because we were not offered any and anytime we attempted to speak with or get the bar tender's attention she just glared and smirked and acted like everything was just a big inconvenience to her. She was literally snatching money out of out hands while we were paying. Ridiculous."
0,"I've only been here once, but thought I'd share after reading some other reviews. \n\nFirst off, this is NOT TexMex. I'm not sure what I would classify it as, maybe AmeriMex, but definitely NOT TexMex. \n\nNow that I have that out of the way, I'll say that I like El Cancun. \n\nI do not like this El Cancun. \n\nWhile it looks decent on the outside and the inside, the food and service were simply terrible. Chicken was very watered down, the salsa was flavorless, and the service make a fast food chain look really good. Just a poor, poor experience at this location overall. If this was the only El Cancun in Charlotte, I would feel the same way many posters do and just never come back. \n\nLuckily for me, I live in Rock Hill. There's an El Cancun here. And it's pretty awesome. I won't give it a full on review because this isn't really the place for it, but suffice it to say that if you're in RH and you see the El Cancun and you go \""ugh, no way that place is terrible\"" don't put your experience with the really shitty location on to the one in Rock Hill and give the other one a chance."
1,"Location is perfect view to the lake but services pretty slow, food average a place to get a beer and see the lake ......"
3,Great little place just across the border.  Food is always great as well as service.
3,"Food was very good. I had the Reuben sandwich. My only suggestion is that the waitress should check back more often to see if we need anything. Otherwise, I recommend it."
2,"The library is a nice, clean facility with good, diverse resources for patrons. However, there is no designated quiet area that is closed off from the noise/speaking that happens in the front of the library. There is a quiet reading room, but it is not closed off, so the noise easily travels back there. Additionally, there are hardly ANY outlets near tables, so if you need to study using a computer, you're quite possibly out of luck. Overall, I expect a quiet area to study in a library, and this one doesn't necessarily deliver. More outlets would also make it a better studying spot."
4,"Any place that's located on a lake for a fish fry is alright with me.. It's packed on Friday which means you get to have a few cocktails while waiting for a table, the wait is worth it... Don't hesitate to try this place out you won't be disappointed.."
4,"What could I possibly say about the Beach House Restaurant and Lounge?  I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce."
3,"For being surrounded by two lakes, Madison doesn't do a great job of having places to drink on the water. Head down to McFarland and check out the beach house. It's like a dive bar slash restaurant right on the lake. Tons of windows. Not a bad place.\n\nCan't comment on the food. Drink specials were solid."
3,"This place has good steaks,and fish fry. I also like the saturday special bacon wrapped filet, with lobster tail,all for 24.99 I think? All the dinners come with soup or salad, potato choic,warm rolls w/ butter. Walleye,cod,bluegill are all delecious. Good place for a beer as well. Great view, and drink specials. This is a real Sconnie place,Wisco to the core. My fave Fish Fry spot for sure."
2,"We had dinner at the Beach House on Friday on our way up to northern Wisconsin based on reviews on Yelp.  If you are looking for good fish fry the Beach House has it.  I had the perch which was great, my bf had the walleye which i think had an even better flavor.  The fish deserves 5 stars.  Everything else a 3 star.  I would give 3 1/2 stars if that were an option.  Would definitely go back."
0,"I took my mom and grandma to the Beach House last night for dinner thinking it would be better than getting a Papa Murphy's pizza. There weren't many patrons in the dining room. Our waitress was very short with us, demanding our drink orders before taking any questions or orders for our food. I ordered scallops, and when they came to the table they were overcooked, but also cold. It took me at least 15 minutes to find the waitress to ask if I could get warmer food. She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food. They scallops were now warm, but lacked flavor, and were even tougher than before. The waitress didn't seem to care about the quality of the food and seemed to be either having a terrible night or was on the influence of something. Needless to say, I will not be returning. On a positive note, the sunset on the lake is pretty."
2,"Three stars = A-OK.  It was fine.  It wasn't great.  This place has been here for about 30 years.  Before that it was a car wash.  I always think of it as the place that used to be a carwash.\nAnyway.  Went with a group of 15.  Mom was buying and we got the \""Classic\"" banquet (the cheapest one).  It was more food than we could eat.  The food was fine.  Not awesome.  The best flavor was hoisin sauce and, well, that comes out of a jar.\nWe got a sesame chicken that had nicely deepfried chicken chunks in a citrus-y sweet sauce.  Some trout that my sister insisted on and really enjoys (not my thing, but everyone else liked it).  Mu-shu pork - it was good.  Delightful (?) beef, kinda bland, but nothing yucky in it.  Aaaannd, oh yeah, crispy duck.  Very crispy, as in dry.  Not so great.\nThe kids got those finger trap toys with their fortune cookies.  The waitress was cheerful, accomodating and informative.  Extra help came out when needed."
0,"This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life.\n\nWe started with the appetizer platter for two.  The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\n\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\n\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \n\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\n\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.  On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for!"
2,"Decent food, slightly more expensive than their competitors, and more legit varieties on their menu.\n\nI'll give credit to Imperial Garden's decor as it is significantly more eye-pleasing than other Asian restaurants and the fact that they have a full bar. \n\nI give kudos to this place because they're the only Chinese restaurant in the area that offers peking duck, a true Chinese specialty. Their seafood selection is also pretty upstanding and are cooked well. I'm also a fan of their \""banquet\"" specials, which is for when you go in groups and they offer you a selection of X many dishes to share for a set price per person (this is available for lunch and dinner I believe, though I've never been here for lunch). \n\nAside from the aforementioned pros of Imperial Garden, the other dishes on their menu (if you order without doing the \""banquet\"") is average-tasting at best and overpriced."
1,"The short of the story is - we went here yesterday (Mother's Day) and were there 3 hours! Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .\n\nFor years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \""Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\"". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.\n\nThe building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. \n\nNow - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.\n\nThis is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. \n\nEventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.\n\nOverall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.\n\nTry it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food."
0,"Absolutely THE worst!  This place won \""Best of Madison\"" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! \nCustomer service:  Very poor.  The server never checked back until I went looking for her, wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering. \nFood finally arrived for our group of four--STONE COLD!  Plates themselves were hot but practically frostbite on the food.  Couldn't eat it. \nManager came by, apologized and took 50% off the bill (!!!). Should have been 100% comped. \nI'm one of those folks who normally overlooks a lot and actually hates to complain, but this culinary travesty really needed to be reported.  If this place previously had great food and service, then as of 2014 they've completely lost their \""mojo\""."

0,We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.
2,"Met some friends here for drinks at the bar, which is shockingly small and not suited for groups larger than 4. The house wines are excellent. I got the lemon artichoke hearts - which were awful, and overpriced. The bread crumbs were drenched in butter and had a greasy feel to them, and the lemon was overpowering. The piano player didn't know any of the songs my friends or I requested - and we weren't making ridiculous requests - what piano player doesn't know Irving Berlin? \n\nIt's a great place to sit and talk and drink wine, AFTER you've eaten somewhere else."

2,"This review of the Madison Marriott West focuses on the group event services of this facility and not the guest rooms.  I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\n\nThe majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\n\nWe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\n\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\n\nThings I liked:\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\n\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\n\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\n\nThings I didn't:\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\n\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\n\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\n\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality."
3,"I've been playing softball at Bowling Green for, well, let's just say \""a long time\"".  While it's not a modern athletic facility, it's got a niche market.  If you enjoy playing ball, having a cold beer, and having fun with some friends - this is a good place for a league.  The umpires are excellent - I've known a few for many years and they do a great job.  \n\nThe fields are smaller, but \""good bats\"" are limited, keeping home runs down a little (but it feels good to get one - it still goes plenty far!).\n\nI hope they stick around for a long time - I love playing there on Tuesday nights."
1,"The scene reminds me of...a garage.  A garage with fairly rude servers and overstuffed patrons with nothing to say.  We waited ... And waited.  The menu had the basics- no problem there.  We waited. Oh, everything is made to order that is why it takes so long... Seriously that is what we were told.  Other reviewers say \""it is like their mothers used to make\"".  Sorry to hear your mom was a lousy cook.  And she must've been a grouch.  Yes the food is pretty bad.  Why people go here I can't understand.  I gave it three visits before passing judgement.  The verdict - AVOID."
1,First we waited 20 minutes which was ok with us but then we waited 45 minutes for our two items to show up that too incomplete. As one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily. Taste was just ok. Won't be going back.
4,"Told them to replace my belt tensioner due to frequent squeaking after replacing my belt.. They looked around and said ,\""nope, take the belt back and ask for a new one under warranty\"".. Charged be $12, and after installing a new belt, turns out they were right. Honest guys."
4,"Recently rented speakers and microphones for an event and was very pleased with the service and quality. I emailed Full Compass, described my needs, and received a prompt response with a quote (within a couple hours). \n\nEasy pick up during regular business hours. I was showed how to use the equipment and it was loaded into my car. Equipment was easy to set up during our event and the sound quality was great! Quick and simple return. Will definitely use them again!"
3,"Hard to pass up the Road Kill Burrito.  Ask for the bucket of sauces.\nIt was as good as when I tried it ten years ago as it was last week.\nI don't think much has changed around here in 30 years, but that is definitely part of the charm.  I have heard the fish fry is good, but I have never been there on a Friday night.  \nLunch crowd has a lot of regular guys, quick and friendly service, prompt and hot food.  \nDon't go looking for the lobster.  Go for the specials, burgers, beer or the burrito!"
4,Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard.
2,Delicious pork sandwich with coleslaw and very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphere
0,"I would love to rate their food, but never got the opportunity.  Happened to stop there on a Saturday evening at about 5:45p and could not even get in the door because the hostess was blocking the area with a party of four.  Instead of taking the party aside so we could enter, and I should point out I was on crutches, she had us wait outside until she could seat them.  We entered AND STEPPED ASIDE so others could enter.  There were three in a our party.  When she asked if we had reservations, I replied no,  and she commented NO?  You KNOW IT IS SATURDAY.  I wanted to say yes, yesterday was Friday and tomorrow is Sunday.  Instead I replied that I was TERRIBLY sorry i did not realize i needed a reservation, and she once again reminded me it was SATURDAY.  I had never been there and did not realize that it was a quaint, small place.  Had I known, I would certainly made a reservation.  I probably will not make a reservation and try the menu since the hostess obviously thought I did not know what day it was.  Yes, it is probably my loss, but I don't enjoy being insulted."
3,"Great food, portions could be smaller. A little pricey for Middleton. Would try somewhere else next time but would also not hesitate to return."

0,"Update: 8/26/12\n\n8:30 A.M. Hangover. Ordered 2 Whoppers w/o cheese and 1 Whopper w/ cheese and 1 order of onion rings. Drive-thru. Had to pull ahead and wait. 21 minutes later, a woman in a purple velvet one piece delivered our food. Don't they have work uniforms here? Jeeez."
1,Wow.  What a bunch of stoners.
1,"This is a brand-new Walmart that was built right next to the old one. They are currently tearing down the old one and, if I remember right, are going to use that space as parking lot. I hope that is correct, especially after my visit today. \n\nI saw three separate vehicles (one on the way in and two on the way out) waiting for somebody to back up and open a spot. No big deal, right? Except that both cars sat and waited for a few minutes. I thought the first car was disabled because it sat there so long. \n\nThe store itself is fine. It's a Super Walmart, so it has the grocery store side. It's a lot like the one in Monona, but without the fun underground parking (best thing I've ever seen in a Walmart) and escalator. I tried to check out using the self-checkout because it is faster when I only have ten items or so. Well, this self-checkout machine was troublesome. It kept telling me I had unauthorized items in bagging area (uh, it was the item I'd just slid over the laser) and then it said I had a restricted item and needed cashier approval to finish up and pay. I didn't have any alcohol, bullets, weapons, or cigarettes. I had a 2-pack of lighters, which was probably it, but why? At any rate, the guy monitoring the self-checkout had to come over and help me three different times. This was in no way faster than just going through a regular register. \n\nThe cashier who helped me to checkout and a guy I asked about Nutella were both nice, but it was an overall frustrating experience. Having the last part be the worst part didn't help."
2,"I love the root beer ! Service and atmosphere was cafeteria-like, food was average. Chicken strips and cheese curds were good."
4,Love everything about this place! My family has been ordering carry out from here for at least 10 years. It's the best Chinese on this side of town. The lo mein rocks!
1,"Way too sweet for my liking. Real authentic Chinese food isn't always sweet. In my opinion, if you like sweet taste this much, might as well eat candy bar dip in corn syrup as a meal. When I ordered my food a few years back from them, they put too much food coloring so much that it looked yellow. It was not appealing to me. But it has been years I haven't been there so they could have improved and better. I sure hope that's the case."
0,"Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave"
0,"I'm on a quest to find a phoenix and dragon similar to my favorite Chinese place in Indy. This is the closet I've come, much to my disappointment. This restaurant keeps getting into my apartment building, despite the security doors. Today they just stuck them in the elevator. Which I thought was pretty neat compared to their normal door spamiming. Then I went down to the first floor and realized they also just scattered them all over the floor.\n\nIn my phoenix and dragon I had five \""jumbo\"" shrimps. Which are really just average sized shrimp. The only thing I can think of is that they consider the mini shrimp some Chinese places have as normal. I guess compared to those the shrimp is jumbo. The \""spicy chicken\"" is just general tso's. I got medium spice which was barely spicy at all. Most of my dish ended up being peas, carrots, and onions in a weird \""spicy\"" sauce that wasn't very good.\n\nI also got the rangoons. Some one else mentioned in this that they don't really have much crab. Which is an understatement. There's maybe a flick of crab in each. They're still fairly good, just not crab.\n\nI suppose the worst part was delivery time. The confirmation email doesn't come with a estimated delivery. Whatever, my boyfriend and I expect 40 minutes like normal. 40 minute mark rolls around and we haven't gotten a call. Since our buzzer system isn't set up we were worried that they didn't see the note to call and were buzzing us. The person who answers says it's in the car and close. 20 minutes later we're still waiting. My boyfriend calls back and goes to give his info. The lady says, \""Oh, you just called. It's almost there,\"" and that was it. Uhm. Ok. A little less than 10 minutes later and it arrives. The driver apologized and It was still hot. So there's that.\n\ntl;dr small portions, not jumbo shrimp, not spicy, not very good, long wait, unfriendly staff on the phones, friendly drivers, and they litter my apartment building a lot."
1,"Visited last Saturday evening and nothing was \""good\"".  Drinks were sub-par and no, not because there wasn't enough booze, because bitters shouldn't be used by the spoonful.  The food was very meh....4 people dined.  Patty melt was ok, Greek burger would have been ok...but who the heck puts olives WITH pits on a burger???  The server happened to check on us right after the pit was bit into and when my friend mentioned to the server that he was just trying to figure out if he cracked a tooth from the pits...she laughed and went \""yeah\"".  The potato skins were so dried out they were mostly inedible.  The fries never saw a grain of salt...or any seasoning for that matter.  Our server was nice but kept forgetting about us or had way too many tables.  We waited forever for food because \""the kitchen was backed up\"" but the place wasn't even full.  Had to get our own silverware, napkins and ketchup....you served coleslaw and french fries to us???"
0,"terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead."
3,"I've been here for shows many times through the years.  The venue is small, but it is cozy and has lots of charm.  I've seen stand up comedy, concerts, and other events here and for pretty much all of them I'd say there isn't a bad seat in the house.  \n\nSince it is small though, it tends to get crowded very quickly  - and in general there is not assigned seating for the shows - so definitely show up early (before doors open) to get the best seats, or to make sure you sit together if you are with a large group.   Parking is not the best, but If you don't mind a small walk parking in the neighborhood behind the theater is your best option."
0,"Worst security at any venue I have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks. $9 for a double? Fuck that noise. Security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door, I've been through airports with hassle."
0,"Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:\n\n1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.\n\n2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)\n\nBeing a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that."
1,"Opinions are a changing.  Went to Pedros over the weekend.  Tamales were not good.  The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long.  I took three bites before I found any pork.  I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home.  When I said no, my satisfaction was not questioned.  I'll stick with Laredos."
2,"I hadn't been to Pedro's in years, since I lived in the area. It was never one of my favorite places in Madison, but I did enjoy it occasionally. I'm generally underwhelmed by the Americanized Mexican places that dot maps of most towns.\n\nHaving just returned from a trip to Seattle and wanting to sit down in an air conditioned building and have some okay food, my dad recommended Pedro's. It seemed like a fine option at the time. Not terribly adventurous, but I just had my adventure and I had to accommodate my dad's less-than-thrill-seeking palette.\n\nThe salsa was actually better yesterday than I ever remember it being in the past. It was very thick and tomato-ey, with just a tiny hint of kick. I'd have preferred it to be a bit hotter, myself, but again, being with the parental unit meant keeping to something a bit more tame.\n\nI had the asada burrito, and my dad had the chili burrito. Mine was fine; long strips of pepper and onion mixed in with some cubed steak (actually, I would recommend cutting the veggies to about half their length...they're too easy to pull completely out of the tortilla when you go to get a bite). I had a side of refried beans and rice; these were obviously simple sizes for the cooks because they were clearly just microwaved. It was easy to tell because the rice was pretty dry. The chili burrito was exactly what my dad was hoping for, so there's that.\n\nAll in all, if you know what you're in for it's very standard American-Mexican fare. \n\nAs an aside, the previous time I was here a few years ago they had this fantastically gay waiter named Jimmy. He was outrageously friendly and chatty and actually sat down at our booth with us to chat about Plan B and the LGBT scene in Madison. It was a fun time!"
0,We called to confirm price AND went online for estimates. The dispatcher told us it would be less than $15. We got to our destination the clock said 10.50 but they said they had to charge us an additional $12! He blamed it on a new dispatcher. Sorry that is not our problem. We will choose another company next time.
2,Grade: C\n\nChain food. Okay service. I can't explain why I don't hate this place.
3,It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect. I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good.
0,A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.
0,"It took them two washes and a visit with the owner to get it partially right.\nThe owner thinks the only way to dry windows and windshields is with a wet cloth.\nI couldn't convince the owner of using dry cloths.\nI won't go back - The guy is brusque, and not ethical.  \nThey have hardly any business - I wonder why?\nThey will be out of business soon.\n\nGo to OCTOPUS for the BEST WASH."
4,"OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY. \n\nDarlene is the owner and #1 World Champion Queen of the Alteration Universe. I really cannot say enough good things about her. Her friendliness, dedication, and skill are unmatched. \n\nI started taking my dress pants here to be taken up almost 8 years ago when I was still in school at Ye Olde UW. At the time, it seemed a pretty far way to go for an alteration place (ALL the way on the east side LOL). But after the first experience, I would never go anywhere else. \n\nI took my wedding dress here for alterations too. As expected, a fantastic job. Now that I live 3 states away, I still bring stuff with me when I visit and have her ship it back to me! Yes, this place is THAT good. Friendly, prompt service, and very reasonable prices. \n\nDarlene and her staff (one other person who I've never met but must be equally as amazing), are just the BOMB plain and simple. Never had a problem with anything done here. Back in the day Alterred States was just a teensy little store in a strip mall on Northport. Now, she's taken over the big middle part! Just goes to show I'm not the only (extremely fanatic) satisfied customer! \n\nBest spot ever. Take your stuff here. You won't be disappointed."
3,"We are BIG fans of Area 51 as well as the former 21st Century Antiques, and everything that we have bought from Michael over 20 years in Madison is not only worth a great deal MORE than we paid for them, WE love them even more than when we bought them and couldn't find them again.\n\nMichael has a fantastic eye and the largest warehouse collection of eclectic modern furnishings, lighting and accessories in the area - art deco, arts & crafts, industrial-mid-mod century. Best to call for an appointment as hours are varied. \n\nBring your truck, tape measure and imagination as Area51 of course has a lot of truly one of a kind BIG pieces in addition to upscale kitsch, whimsy and collectible bling."
1,"Too institutional.  Out of a can, bag, box, or freezer.  Parking is very limited.  Not a fan."
2,"So my family and I are trying to enjoy our meals while a group of customers on the other side of the incredibly small dining room are having a loud conversation, taking calls via their cell phone speakers, and listening to YouTube videos on their phones.  I tell our server about it and the manager is then informed.  When the manager walks past the group to investigate, they're not being noisy so nothing is said.  The noise then picks up again and our server comes by to drop off our check.  We're told that our meal is comped by 50%, which I'll obviously take, but that nothing was being done about the noise because the manager didn't hear anything.  So my complaint was without merit and the loud group shouldn't have been told that other customers were complaining about the noise they were making?!  What an incompetent manager!  The food was merely meh.  Other than the noise issue, our server was fine."
2,"Here's the thing, I just never have cash on me, and so it's unlikely I'll ever do the bulk of my shopping at Jenifer Street Market. With that said, my excitement from a year ago has dimmed due to the fact that their produce section has really taken a hit, and I find the place a bit dirty. I don't really want the place I'm buying consumable products to be dirty. Staff is helpful and I don't mind their unfortunate maroon vests (seriously what's with those) but the place has just really gone down hill and doesn't warrant using the ATM and paying insane fees."
0,"My husband, a friend, and myself went there for fish on black Friday. We were surprised that it was not very busy so we thought we would get service pretty quickly. We sat at a table near the salad bar and waited....and waited... and waited. We saw one server and also saw another table waiting for service as well. The waitress never once acknowledged that we were sitting there and she had to pass our table to to wait on another table. All the waitress had to do was say she would be right with us...or SOMETHING. After waiting a half hour with no word from the waitress, we got up and left. Murphy's Bar was way more accommodating."
3,Neighborhood delivery and takeout great....certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level.\nThey don't biast 30
1,"Friendly staff and quick service but, unfortunately they couldn't make up for the unappetizing dining room and BLAND food.  I'll  be shopping around for another Chinese place."
1,The food can be good here (not great but good) but the biggest problem for me is the AWFUL service.  Somebody teach these people some customer service.  I swear that the guy who waited on me the last time I was there was high.  The interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof.\n\nI've determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl...  that seemed to keep the waiter's attention focused on the table next to mine...  Maybe she was one of the more positive posters here.
2,"I was disappointed with my experience, but I'm willing to give it another shot.\n\nThe main problem was our waiter. We had very slow service. We were seated outside and had to go in to ask for our menus. I ordered coffee and half-and-half, but I didn't get a spoon or something to stir it with, which I thought was odd. I just kind of swished it around... It was weird.\n\nOur waiter failed to tell us the scrambler special and when we asked he told us it was artichoke, tomato and asiago. However, when it arrived the artichokes were not there. It was very disappointing. The breakfast potatoes were also a real let down. I love potatoes and they failed. However, the biscuit was delicious. \n\nWe also ordered pie. Two of our party ordered the Fat Elvis - which does not come in a pie-form - so they were upset. Their other waiter must have made that mistake. I went for the key lime pie which was delicious. The Fat Elvis was replaced with a drumstick (?) which I guess was good, but I don't like peanut butter. \n\nAnother thing is if you sit outside, they will give you plastic silverware. I didn't mind, but others in my party did. Also, they only take Visa and Mastercard. \n\nOverall, the food was good, but the service was not. Andrew K attempted to show off his humor (\""Elvis has left the building\""), but we found it rather obnoxious because we were sick of waiting. I'll give him some slack because there were a lot of people seated outside, but I feel he could have paid a bit more attention."
4,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I've been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best. Breakfast all day, more than just burgers and fries, deserts, beer selection....I can't rave enough.\n\nThe meatloaf of the Gods is to die for and their Just Coffee roast (their own blend) is so amazingly good I have my mom buy it and send it up to me in Minneapolis. It's that good.\n\nSome of the people that work there have been there since I was a kid. Its a neighborhood place where you're bound to run into people you know and I make a point to go there at least twice while I'm home to visit.\n\nYay Monty's!"
2,"I like Monty's food--breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all very good--but I just can't help thinking that it's overpriced when I go there.  It seems like it should be diner-priced . . . but almost $9 for a grilled cheese seems a bit steep to me.  Their desserts are to die for, though."
2,"I've been coming here since I was in middle school and it was the cool place to hang out on half-days. 6 orders of waffle fries, anyone?\n\nWe went last night for an early dinner and squeezed 7 people into a booth. I got blueberry pancakes (LOVE breakfast all day) and they were okay.  My friend's french toast came with apple butter though, and slathered on top of the pancakes = much better pancakes.  Around the table there were also a few types of burgers, a meatloaf sandwich, a fruit plate, and a whole lot of milkshakes and sundaes. Big let down: they were out  of over half of the mix-ins for the milkshakes/sundaes. You can't have a dirt cup without gummy worms!\n\nOverall, I've always liked it here. Service can be hit or miss. Food is pretty good. Milkshakes are hurt-your-teeth sweet."
0,Yucky greasy food.
3,"Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans.  In fact, their veg dishes are just plain good. Service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious."
3,What an eclectic menu for a diner!  The ambiance is just what you would expect from a classic 60's diner.  I had a ruben and some fries and it was really good!  Most places use processed corned beef.  Theirs was real sliced beef...very tender and very flavorful.  Probably the best ruben I have ever had.  I had to try the pie too since they tease you with a great display right when you walk in.  The French silk was really rich and chocolaty.  Definately worth the stop if you are in the area or passing through.
3,"Craving a chocolate malt, I stopped in on a walk around 3 pm on a Friday afternoon. The place was largely empty, and spotless. I haven't been to Monty's in several years, after suffering from 'stomach issues' after dining here back then, I couldn't bring myself to chance it again.\n\nNo issues this time, I'm happy to report. I ordered a triple chocolate malt to go. Chocolate (Sassy Cow!) ice cream, chocolate milk and chocolate syrup. Really good, and worth the $7 price tag. Definitely killed the craving, and put a happy spring in my step for the rest of my errand walk around the Atwood area.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly, as there were more than enough employees waiting around for the afternoon and evening dinner rush to begin. Maybe next time I'll be brave enough to try the food again :-)"
3,"Amazing is all I can say. They have absolutely everything. No, it's not organic but it's super homemade and killer. I get something different every time I am there and have yet to be disappointed. All the brats, beef, chicken, BACON are all wonderful. Support local butchers or they will disappear! Perfect example, I went in and asked for a pound of italian sausage (kale/cauliflower/sausage pot pie, yum!) and they were out but they offered to make me some on the spot. Really amazing service and great product quality. Make the trip to Jim's"
4,"This was our first B&B expierence and it was amazing! We stayed here June 2012 for a birthday weekend. The owners made us feel very special and right at home. Our room, the Madison Lakes Room, was huge and the bathroom was spectacular. I loved the steam shower! The property is large and a great place to take a walk during the day. They are also lots of outdoor seating areas to sit and enjoy the scenery or read a book. The breakfast was great, I think we had 3 courses a day of food. Pat makes a great breakfast and Bob provides good company during the meal. Their dog Happy is also a companion while you eat or walk the property.\n\n They do also have snacks in the lounge area for you to enjoy at anytime. There are sodas in the fridge and sometimes fresh baked cookies!"
2,"Slightly lower than average Hampton Inn.  Heat/AC wasn't updated, pretty typical besides that."
2,"Went here for Friday Night Fish Fry (after reading a decent review of the place from one of the fish fry ranking sites).  The place is T-I-N-Y tiny, but that's not a bad thing.  There are a handful of tables around the outside of the bar, and about 25-30 seats at the actual bar itself.  A low ceiling lends to the really smallish feel of the place.\n\nGreat jukebox, great service, good value.  We really enjoyed hanging out at the Villa Tap.  \n\nDrinks: we tried the whiskey old fashioned sour.  Lost points for not being muddled and for not using Squirt.  It was decent, regardless, and a great value; three old fashioneds came in at under $10.\n\nFood-wise - mixed results.  The appetizers (onion rings and cheese curds) were excellent.  Some of the best we've ever had, even if the curds were \""out of the box\"" curds.  They were cooked perfectly, didn't show any signs of grease, and were absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe fish - we had deep fried cod all around - left much to be desired.  It was cooked better than any other fish we've ever had - it was so perfectly prepared... the batter was light and crispy; it was served piping hot; no signs of grease - it had all of the makings of a great fish fry.\n\nBut it was too fishy tasting; not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Cod shouldn't have a strong fish flavor.  Save that for bad Ocean Perch or Smelt... and that's what this cod tasted like.  :-(  So, despite being prepared to perfection, it failed to deliver on taste.\n\nThe fries were perfect, which is such a shame.  The Villa knows how to fry a mean dish - just wish the fish wasn't so \""off\"" tasting.  We'll give them another shot, though.  I'm sure the burgers and other offerings are going to be good - The Villa was spot-on with everything else, so the fish may have been a fluke.\n\nVilla Tap = No Win/No Fail - it's a tie\n\nService = 4 stars (fast, prompt, spot-on)\nFood = 2.5 stars (fish = fail; all others = win)\nValue = 4 stars ($40 for 3 people with appetizers and fish)\nMisc = 4 stars (atmosphere, homey feel)\n\nDefinitely a great little bar; we'll give the fish another shot at some point and we'll certainly try the rest of the menu items!"
4,"My husband and I love this little gem of a neighborhood bar. We are constantly on the hunt for best \""bar burger\"" (so we have a lame hobby...whatever, it's fun!) and we agree that Villa Tap is one of the best bar burgers in town. Jenny St ground chuck, fresh veggies on the burgs, good bun, also they have good apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)...all good so far. Good Bloody Mary's too. We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid the crowds, in the mood for a good cheeseburger, etc - had a great time. The burgers were top-notch, jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live Dead, which is great). The regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating \""townie-bar\"" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice and fun to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even! Unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available to write messages. We really don't have complaints at this point. We're excited to try their brunch soon!"
4,"Doesn't look like anything special from the outside and was a bit reluctant to go in, but I'm thrilled I did. Honestly used to go here every weekend when I lived in the area. Perry makes one of the best burgers in town. I think they said they get their meat fresh from the willy st co-op every day. So delicious. Then I'd stay and fill up on relatively cheap drinks and catch the Brewers or Bucks game. They have a ton of tv's along with pool, ping pong, and darts. Perfect place if you want some good food and a place to watch the game."
2,"I love the Ohio.  It's the kind of hellhole where you can watch a prostitute sing \""like a virgin\"" on karaoke night, and see old dudes in satin jackets with bar logos on them get in fights.\n\nClassy."
2,"Kind of tucked away and hard to notice, especially being next to the really glammed out Ella's Deli. But worth a visit if you're looking for a good gyro or kebab. :]\n\nThe donuts are alright too. They have a wide variety! Myself, I really rather like their cookies. They also offer homemade baklava.\n\nReally though I can reccomend their sandwiches with a side of the seasoned fries. Quite yummy! Vegetarian options also available such as potato kahbi or falafel sandwiches. And they had a lot of beverages to choose from too.\n\nAlthough the location is not ideal, it's worth a stop if you're in that part of town. :]"
3,"Now this is what I'm talking about!!  Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \n\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\n\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \n\nQuick review:\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\n\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\n\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\n\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \n\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\n\nAll in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj."
2,"I love their thin crust pizza but I always feel a little ripped off which keeps me from ordering from them often.  They charge a steep delivery fee which if not taken form the tip makes a pizza almost 28 bucks.  Other places around here have bullshit delivery fees (along with bitchy statements about not taking the fee out of your tip, as if the person buying the food is responsible for the shitty wage the store pays or the tacked on fee that apparently does not actually support delivery) but they are usually less."
0,"I was in town for the weekend with my son (13) and his friend. asked the front desk at my hotel if there was any good Chicago style pizza places in Madison. I was directed to rosati's. such a disappointment. very bland & the crust...just no. the teenagers even thought it was mediocre. we each tried a slice, put the rest in the hall & called a different place."
4,N E W   S E A T S !!!!  The old bench were terrible and kept us away.  We spent two games this year and we are hooked.
3,"Had a lot of fun at a Mallards game recently.  Food and beer are top-notch in both prices and quality.  Front-row seats along the basepaths are a bit narrow and claustrophobic; it seems like they sacrificed about 3-4 inches of legroom compared to other rows.  People were friendly, but the all-out assault on buying raffle tickets and everything when you walk in the park is a bit much.  Loved the between-inning games and promos."
4,Really beautiful place. Must go see - herb garden - TOUCH N FEEL was really good. Otherwise really big place and definitely can cater to an event. Thai Garden was also good.
3,"Pretty impressive landscaping, floral and fauna display. Free admission, but I suggest spending the extra $2 and visit the conservatory whi check has butterflies and a few birds."
0,"Grease running down my hand. That's a first. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but definitely not me.\n\nSorry, Pizza Pit staff. \n\n[Cue the Tim & Eric \""Ya blew it!\"" .gif.]"
0,"The decor was ok. Nothing special but there were some odd mylar stars and hot air balloons hanging from the ceiling\n\nCame in for dinner and there are two other tables at 8:00 on a Thursday night.  I wonder if people go to bed early around this neighborhood or if this place just isn't that popular.\n\nCoconut soup was weird .  A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.   \n\nLamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well.  The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste.  Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb.  They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt).  A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite.\n\nRice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits.  I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant.  Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there.  If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more.  \n\nI tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness.\n\nThree sauces or chutneys that came with the papadom were not very good at all. \n\nHad to ask to have my water glass filled every single time I finished it. (this is a major pet peeve)"
0,DO NOT EAT HERE.  They changed my tip and charged me $28 for lunch.  Absolutely ridiculous.
0,"I read the new ass't governor gave a speech there invoking God.  Please, spare me, now I will pass.\n\nPlease save that shit for church.  The rest of us will pass on this crap."
1,"Poor service by the wait staff is my biggest complaint. We were there at 5:00 (and it wasn't busy yet), and it took probably 15 minutes to place our order. \n\nFinally, $16.95 for a fish fry. Yowzers!"
1,"Grade: D\n\nYeah, I order my martinis served on the rocks and in goblets... Duh."

1,"I went in for an oil change and an inspection. i receive close to a thousand dollars in \""recommendations.\"" The next day, I decided to get the breaks serviced as they told me it was the most pressing issue with my car. After fixing my breaks they refused to put my tire on because they decided it was not road worthy, but for an additional 200 bucks they would fix it for me. \n\nPerhaps I would have been more understanding if :\n\n1) This had been in the original inspection (it wasn't) \n2) I hadn't had the tire looked at on several other occasions including them (twice! Once several months ago and once during inspection) \n3) They hadn't decided for me what is and is not acceptable - (ask first then together we make choice).\n4)They asked me to sign a new inspection ticket as if they had brought up wheels initially, smeared with capital letters and exclamations as if that would help send it back into the past. I found it so antagonizing that I decided to share the experience here.\n\nIt was shady business. it made me feel like they were trapping me into spending money that I did not have. There was a better way to express their concerns, if they were legitimate. In the end, I had someone else call on my behalf because I was so confused.\n\nThey get two stars because the person who called to inform me of the debacle tried to sound understanding and because my breaks seem to be in working order. \n\nWith all this stress perhaps I should have gone to the dealer. Turns out they would have charged me less for my breaks.  (that almost never happens)  Just be careful and shop around."
3,Best BBQ in Madison.  Hands down.  Only loses a star for consistently messing up take-out orders and not being up to par compared to places in the south.
3,"Great BBQ!\nIt's a little out of the way, but worth the journey if you're looking for decent BBQ.\nI don't remember seeing any highchairs.  We ended up bringing in our stroller for our daughter to sit in.\nWhile you have to order your food at the counter, there is a wait staff that will bring your food to you and refill your drinks.\nNo alcoholic beverages... (that's why 4 stars)."
4,"The ribs, you must try them! My major mistake was getting a 1/3 slab."
3,"RIBS RIBS RIBS! I like me some niceeee slab of ribs, drizzled in a tangy, but slightly sweet BBQ sauce. Smoky Jon's definitely delivered!! They held  true to their many awards (nicely displayed next to their register) and I was more than content once I finished eating.\n\nThe ribs themselves were just ordinary- pretty juicy, but nothing to blow my mind. What I found amazing was the sauce and the sides!!! The corn was deliciousss, especially all dressed up in their special seasoning. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted just like the ones I usually make at home, which are pretttty darn amazing- if I should say so myself.\n\nOne downfall was that there is a $4.00 plate splitting fee (BOOOOO!). I really wanted to try the 1/2 slab + sandwich + sides combo (only like 2 bucks more than just 1/2 slab) but I knew I couldn't finish it by myself... and it just wouldnt be worth it to pay $4.00 more to share it with a friend. Hmm... or maybe, next time don't be as dumb as me and say out loud you want to share.... sneakily share it at the table!!\n\nAnyways, Smoky Jon's was a great farewell from Madison meal for me, leaving me nice and full, the perfect prep for a long flight back to Los Angeles. \nI'd give it a solid 4 stars."
4,"B.E.S.T. brunch in Madison. \nBrunch at airport  - \""huh\"" right? Right.\n\nThe restaurant is located with in the Wisconsin Aviation building, which is across the field from where the commercial flights are housed.  You can eat the fantastic food while plane watch for your pleasure. If you haven't been here already, you're missing out - A. Lot. \n\nThe airy pancakes that I ordered were fluffy, and really the best I've had in Madison. It sounds like a \""guilty pleasure,\"" but the pancakes are truly airy that it doesn't feel heavy on the stomach after clearing the plate. The three eggs omelet was equally spectacular. Plus the solid cordial service seals the 5-stars deal.\n\nThe scene is a clean diner, but as my friend put it, \""it's an actual diner with good food, and not like the other wanna-bes.\"" Absolutely correct. And there's no need to do too much flare on the decor when they got the fantastic view of the private planes against the blue sky. I will be back for more for sure! Maybe a sunset dinner for the next time?"
1,"I typically rent my cars through Enterprise, but this experience has me shaking my head. I landed less than 30 minutes early and went to get my rental. When I got to the counter I was told they didn't even have a car the property and would make some phone calls. They told me they had another car, but they wanted to charge me extra. (I've always been upgraded at no extra cost in these situations) I booked my car through hotwire and was told that by choosing a compact over economy that I would get more features. However, when I got my car it didn't even have cruise and I had to put on about 300 miles. The car didn't drive straight, wasn't that clean (front windshield was streaked from the inside and something was spilled in the center cup holder.) There were no power seats or adjustable steering wheel. (I found a lever, but it didn't seem to do anything - broken maybe?) I was mostly upset that the car didn't have cruise, you would think that would be a standard feature. When I returned the car and the lady asked me how it was, I told her that I was unhappy, but she didn't seem to really have anything to say except when I told her my biggest complaint was that it didn't have cruise, she did say that the guy who issued the car to me at the airport should have told me that. Come on Enterprise... you can do better than this!!!"

4,"i cannot believe that no one had yelped this place- thank you jaymi and michelle, you are geniuses. \n\nmy friends from madison visiting a couple weeks ago told me that michaels is  just as it was when i was there maybe 8 years ago so this review should be accurate. one word sums it up. PERFECTION. they also told me they dont go often, or at least every day, which i would. you would be beyond obese but it would be worth it. i have only had the frozen custard here and being lactose intolerant but in denial makes it a rough experience. there is nothing like this in the world- italian gelati, nopee, argentine ice cream del dios, cant touch this shit. \n\nmichaels frozen custard is literally the best taste sensation i have experienced in my life. that is a big statement and im owning it.  it doesnt even matter what flavor you get, its that good. you dont even have to get toppings on it- though i would toss some peanut butter cup chunks on. could be worth the drive to madison alone."
3,"Wow, this antique mall seems to go on and on forever. It is huge and has a wonderful selection of collectibles. I am in the market for collectible books and they had so many books, that I could not see them all in this trip. There are a lot of kitchen items, dishes and vintage toys. This is a great place to spend a Saturday afternoon. The prices were reasonable. There was a check in offer and some of the dealers booths have coupons."
2,The Good\nLots of local food\nDelicious pre-made food options\nPretty decent bakery\n\nThe Bad\nNot a lot of options for staples\nA little hard to navigate\n\nThe Ugly\nPrice are sometimes just too high for my taste
2,"While not for everyone, I find this store to be just fine for me when I need to pick up a few things for dinner and get some (great) donuts for my husband. It's also a great store for moms with young children or the elderly since everything is compact and easy to reach or get to. The staff seems to work like an extended family, friendly with customers and maybe a bit too open about their personal lives. Now that competitive stores are being built around the older strip mall where it resides, I fear for the outcome of this little store that I can walk or bike to."
0,"I had a craving for KFC. I went through the drive through and the machine was muffled terribly. The service was slow. When I got home, the food was poor quality. The mashed potatoes were dry and the macaroni and cheese was lumpy. Even the coleslaw was very dry. The worst was the chicken strips, which were extremely dry and nearly too hard to bite into. \n\nI returned to the location to comment the next day and the man at the counter (I assume the manager) was very rude.\n\nI would not recommend this location based on service and good quality."
1,"Ok, so Dairyland gets a really bad rap. I get it, it is small, simple, nothing special.  The service is good.  The food is decent. However, the place is not awful.  It is just your local breakfast place with food options under $10.  I had the ham and cheese omelette. Was it great?  No. It was a plain ham and cheese omelette. This restaurant reminds me of cute little hole in the wall breakfast places.  \n\nIt is very family friendly. They always have ample parking and can accommodate large groups.  Unfortunately, it just can not compete with some of its neighboring restaurants."
2,"This location used to be an absolute hole.  They recently renovated both the interior and the exterior, and now it's a very pleasant, good-looking store.\n\nHowever, it's still Wendy's food.  And that's only okay."
0,Sloooooowwwwwwwww. Couldn't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food.
2,Typical burger and beer place.  Food is pretty good.  Service was great!
1,"Wouldn't do an oil change when I came in at 5:10, the guy at the desk said they didn't have time to do it, but they only had one car in the bay. What's the point in advertising a cheap special on oil changes if you won't do it because you close only an hour after people get off work."
2,"The best fast food I know of. Maybe Chipotle, as well. Staff is always friendly. I'm not from here but this place is very Wisconsin-y to me, in a food way.\n\nGood chili."
1,"Giving this place two stars is a stretch, but the front service people have always been friendly, so there you go. \n\nNow about my experience with Hickory Hills:\n\nI was a loyal customer for three years for one of my dogs. Although I never felt like the service was great there, the prices were good and they seemed to care about the dogs, so I kept coming back. \n\nI don't know if something changed, but over time my dog started coming back sore and covered in blood. He started acting terrified whenever I would pull up front, and it was clear he was having bad experiences there. I asked the owner about this, and she said that nothing was going on and that he played well with other dogs. \n\nWell two months ago, my healthy four year old dog came back barely able to walk. It took weeks before he recovered, and he still hasn't seemed himself. I can't help but wonder what goes on there, but it seems like something fishy is going on. \n\nTo make matters worse, I boarded him at a different kennel last weekend. The owner immediately called me after I dropped him off and explained that he was acting traumatized and terrified of the kennel. He said it was very obvious he was not suited for kennels. \n\nUnfortunately, he also told me that some kennels are known for taking dogs that don't do well and lying to the owners to keep the business. When I mentioned Hickory Hills, he laughed and said they were the worst kennel in Madison. He also told me a story about how the owner or manager killed several dogs by leaving insect poison out in the play area.\n\nI feel so lucky my dog wasn't more hurt at this horrible kennel, and I hope nobody else has to lose a beloved pet to this sub-par facility. This is a harsh review but these things matter."
2,As much as I love the idea of saving a poor helpless animal from being put to death this place could use some work if they intend to adopt animals out! First and foremost the customer service here is terrible. My parents have visited the shelter on more than one occasion to view the dogs ready for adoption and have yet to be greeted with a friendly helping hand. If they had they would have a dog right now. Its hard to enquire about a dog when no one or information is available regarding the dog. In addition I believe adoption fees ranging from $175.00 to $350.00 are a bit much especially considering the funding the Dane County Humane Society receives.  Perhaps they should consider arranging discounted fees with vet services they use.  I understand it does cost a great deal of money to home an animal which should be taken into consideration by the adoptee however you shouldnt have to spend hundreds to get a dog. I mean considering they put thousands of dogs to sleep each year!!! Nonetheless if you can rescue a animal from here...There is no greater gift than the gift of life!
2,"Mediocre sushi, that is priced above what it should be at."
3,"Well made sushi, not expensive; always fresh.  Very friendly people and I actually like the casual decor.  They make orders out up quickly too!  Not a great place for a fancy date, but one of my favorites in Madison for the true sushi lover who isn't looking to make a big deal of their sushi dinner - they just crave solidly well done sushi."
1,Great bread!  But I wish the sandwiches were a little bigger.  I got the wheat sub roll with meal deal and it disappeared too quickly...left me hungry!  I guess I'll try the french bread next time.  Maybe it's a little bigger.
4,"We've been to Boomerangs on several occasions now. Their wing night on Wednesdays can't be beat. Their sauces are really good. I actually prefer a lot of their sauces over that big-chain wing place (which I won't name). The wings are really big and only 33 cents. I like that you can get as many of any flavor as your want without an extra charge. My favorite sauces are the jerk and tequila lime.Their sides and burgers are really good, too. \n\n{EDIT} We went to wing night again last night and got onion rings. I can't think of anyplace that has better onion rings. They're not frozen, obviously hand-dipped. They even give you the fried crumblies. Holy moly, they were so good. \n\nNice staff, nice place. I like going here because it has a neighborhood bar feeling."
2,"ok, so the \""not very thorough\"" part i mentioned in my last review is the main problem with the subsequent visits i've paid to this place. the pedicures i've had have taken about 10 minutes, tops--very hurried and not exactly thorough. last time i went, they cut my toenails crooked to top it all off. ugh. guess my quest for a decent nail joint here in town isn't quite over."
4,"Dr. Curt Thurman is my hero.\n\nI trust Curt with my pets completely.  He is absolutely wonderful with the animals and treats them with as much care and compassion as if they were his own.  He explains everything and the reasons for it; never have I felt in the dark about what was going on.  Our dog has had some pretty serious health problems as she's gotten older, and having Curt as our vet made the process of dealing with everything a lot easier for me.  He offers wonderful advice on all things pet and is great about making himself available to answer questions if you call with a concern.\n\nThe staff is great as well.  They are super-friendly, very helpful and my dog loves them.  Actually, my dog loves everything about Caring Hands.  She actually gets excited when we drive in the direction of the clinic and literally drags me in the door when we arrive because she is so excited to visit herCaring Hands friends.\n\nI can't say enough wonderful things about this clinic.  I dread graduating and moving from the area because I know I it will be impossible to find another vet that comes anywhere near the quality of Caring Hands."
4,"General Tso's Chicken is one of my favorite dishes, and this place has the best General Tso's I've ever tasted. You also get A LOT for what you pay. I often end up eating my leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day. \n\nTheir crab ragoon is so good - fried to a crisp, filled full. It is always warm with cool, gooey cream cheese in the center. Even their egg rolls are some of the best I've ever had.\n\nThe only thing that bothers me (the food is so good, though, I don't even care) is the language barrier. No matter how I phrase it, I always end up with different portions/variations on my dish. I have never gotten the same thing there twice or paid the same price twice. You always get A TON of whatever entree you order, but sometimes you get a small order of rice, sometimes you get a large. Sometimes it's fried rice, whether you say fried or not, and sometimes, you get an egg roll, whether you ask for it or not. So if you think that will bug you, maybe the place isn't for you, but this place has some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The price is always great for a poor student like me, too; a great Friday night date, Wok take out and a movie on Netflix."
4,"Wonderful bake-it yourself pizza.  My friend and I always get the vegetarian and it comes loaded with all the usual veggies and ample cheese.  There's a gourmet vegetarian option with artichoke hearts and spinach that's great as well.  They have good fresh salads and cookie dough for sale also.  Service went downhill there for awhile-they had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us if we came in a half hour before closing, because they were wanting to clean up for the night.  But those employees seem to be gone and everyone is very nice again.  Prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality.  A winner!"
3,Stopped here on our way back form Florida... not much to choose from out here...\n\nI tried the shrimp & grits.. AWESOME!!!!  Never thought  this would be a good combo but it works here!! \nAnd try the crustless coconut cream pie... MMMM!!!\ngood attentive service.
4,"Farm and Fleet is perfect for finding items like spark plugs, air filters, and other automotive bits.  They also offer a huge selection of housewares and hardware.  Also, this place is CHEAP.  \n\nOne other thing: if you're a student going to a barn dance, Farm and Fleet is your one stop shop for flannel shirts, farm boots, and enormous belt buckles."
0,"soooo, it has been over two years since my last review... the service at farm and fleet's small engine repair no longer meets my standards.\n\nlast year i took an MTD mower in with a leaking fuel line.  i asked for the fuel line to be replaced, and when i returned to pick up the mower... a complete tune up had been done.  i was anticipating a 20-30 bill for labor and hose, instead i got $70+ bill for a tune up i never asked for.  ok, i got hosed, payed up and the mower ran fine.\n\nthis year i took my Yard Machine weedeater in for a new starter pull cord.  that's it, just a starter pull cord because the current one is frayed.... so i get charged 15 bucks which will apply to the repairs later.  i think to myself \"" what's there to look at, just replace the starter pull cord.    sooooo, i wait...  10 days, no call from farm and fleet.... so i call them.  they tell me it'll be two weeks and an additional $45 before they get to my weedeater repaired! \n\nWHAT?  i'll come pick it up.\n\nlearn from my errors, find somewhere else for your small engine repair work.\n\ni went on-line and bought the replacement parts for 15 bucks.  i should have done that first."
1,I get my hair cut at these types of places and i rotate all the time. There is a guy here - mildly creepy and blatently prompting you for gossip. I'm sure he and so many other stylists get a ton of it but i could tell he was prompting me for it. No thanks. When i want to put people on blast i'll do it myself.
1,"Went here after a doctors appointment one day. The pizza was good. The small salad wasn't their best. The service sucked. The waitress didn't give us refills and nothing was clean. She gave us our check but never came back to take our money. My husband almost walked out after being ignored at the desk by many waitresses that still wouldn't take our money. Finally, the manager did. I will not be back because of the horrible service."
2,"MTD is a great way to get to class when the weather is nasty.  However, the buses are often late, so be sure to choose a bus that arrives to your destination a few minutes early.  At least the MTD buses are free to students."
1,"It's a place that is easy to both love and hate. On one hand they have some unique academic programs and great professors, but you'll probably have to slog through lots sub-par classes before you get the good classes. \n\nBusiness is one of the \""better\"" colleges, but you wouldn't know if from the lower level classes. My least favorite class ever was an upper level econ (econ is technically in LAS even though business people spend plenty of time in the department) class that was taught by a TA who not only didn't speak very good English, but who also gave really harsh tests. The first test average was a 64% and there was no curve. Grading is harsh here! Lots of people repeat classes. I also have plenty of bad things to say about accounting and finance classes, but it depends on the class I guess. \n\nLAS is the catch-all college that gets shafted a lot. Many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart. Contrast that with the much-funded engineering college's glittering shiny collection of brand new giant buildings. Oh well. \n\nACES, my college, is a bit of a catch-all college as well, but some of the majors are quite small. I've had my smallest and favorite classes in ACES. For development and other niche economics specialties this is the place to be and undergrads get lots of attention. It also has top-notch programs in other aggy stuff ranging from food science to animal science. I adore most of my professors I have had in this college. The only downside is that ACES has tended to attract some less than bright students in the past and has some programs within it in need of reform, but I'm sure that is true in many UIUC colleges.  I recommend ACES, but only if you are truly interested in the curricula. \n\nI would note that I skipped all gen-eds and a lot of ugly giant lower level classes thanks to APs and placements tests. If you can do that, it is worth it, because the upper level classes are where you can really enjoy academics. The lower level classes seem to be purposefully soul-crushing, with harsh curves, unintelligible TAs, and professors who just read off powerpoints. 101 classes are where learning goes to die. I basically did well on them by memorizing lectures off flashcards, a sad way to \""learn\"" if you ask me. Don't be afraid to switch classes if you get a bad feeling on the first day. I did that a lot and it was worth it for the English-speaking TAs. \n\nI am personally not a fan of the Greek system, which welds a little too much power here. The drunken anti-intellectual environment can be stifling if you don't find a niche. Allen Hall is the place to be for anti-Greeks/hippies/outsiders and it has the bonus of small lower level classes often taught by people who actually care. Avoid the isolated residence halls like PAR and FAR, go six-pack only if you are Greek-ish, and ISR is the place to be for engineers and other assorted people who want to live near the science and engineering buildings. Dorm food is a mixed bag...it's mostly just inexcusably bad, but most people don't seem to notice because they think fries and hot dogs= acceptable lunch. \n\nI like the Chambana area, even if it has some minor annoyances. Ill-kept frat houses and a bizarre lack of on-campus grocery stores mar it, but otherwise it was easy for me to find restaurants to eat at and assorted drunk-free places to hang out. However, I can think of about ten major cities where I'd rather live.\n\nThe weather here is horrible. In the summer you scald and in the winter you freeze, so pack your snowboots and your short-shorts."
0,"This place is awful! I have rented from this location several times over the years and not once has it been good, but this experience has put me off U-Haul forever. A planned move to Fla has been thrown into total disarray because they screwed up a reservation that I made in person and confirmed in person, 6 weeks in advance! The employees are either dumb or just don't give a shit. They're unorganized and totally clueless. I have never used a business so poorly run. How this store stays in business is a mystery to me and any corporation that tolerates such bad performance from a franchise will not get another $ from me. Or maybe they're all this bad. Regardless, I suggest you use Penske, Budget or carry your shit on your back before using U-Haul!"
0,"I rented a truck in July for a one-way move.   I was supposed to pick the truck up around 10 AM, but it wasn't available until well after 2 PM.  When I showed up at 10:00, there was a long line of customers and only one employee who could work the computer.   Since my truck wasn't there, the employee said I should call over in a few hours to check on the status.  When I called the number he gave me, I was routed to a central call center and my call was answered by a disgruntled troll.  So I decided to make a second personal appearance.  This time, I got into line behind the guy who was returning my truck 4 or 5 hours late.  The employee behind the computer from the morning appeared to be the only staff member at the location - literally.  He dealt with the previous guy, cleaned out the truck, then processed the paperwork for me.  That employee was extremely nice, but it was ridiculous that he was left there by himself.  The process took about an hour.\n\nAlso, the boxes that I bought there fell apart.  Buy your boxes from Two Men and a Truck - they're more expensive, but they stay together."
2,"Can't go wrong with Brothers. Large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game. Not as good as the Iowa location, but worth checking out."
0,"I saw Dr. Samuel-Parks at the Mahomet location to discuss weight loss medication. I am a veterinarian myself, and I have completed nearly identical medical education to her. I expected some level of professional courtesy, or at the very least not treating me like a layperson. Dr. Samuel-Parks was condescending and dismissive. She told me right off the bat: \""I don't believe in diet pills.\"" She patronized me, told me to stop drinking sugary coffee drinks (I don't. I hate them. I drink my coffee black. She just assumed I drink 700 calorie frappes.). She didn't even perform a full physical on me. Then I got a bill for $130 for five minutes of being talked down to and a TPR. I found another doctor who actually listened to me, treated me like an intelligent person, and with a diet and exercise program and a phentermine prescription I've lost 20 lbs."
3,"Dorcas is a very standard Korean restaurant... that Koreans actually go to! The portions are substantial, soups authentic, and banchan wonderfully served. This place reminds me of cafeterias back in Seoul, and not necessary all in a good way. The interior is clearly not meant for show, and while you know what? It makes the food stand out even better!"
1,"One word.  Disappointed.\n\nGood looking interior, and even had some of the old tables from the original Zorbas.\n\nI ordered my food and waited to pay.  The cashier left to take orders, and the line started backing up.  The fifteen minute wait time would be forgivable if the fries weren't old, overcooked, and the portions of meat, small.  There was literally 30-40 people crammed into this place ordering food and still got bad french fries...\n\nGreen St. never really had good quality food, but there is a disturbing trend of places like Beef Stand and Sliders charging EXPENSIVE prices for college students and making subpar food.   Nero's on university charges about the same price for what I got, and their fries are fresh and hot, give you huge portions on gyro meat and have it cooked well.  The only thing I paid for was the convenience of eating on Green St.  \n\nAs a college student, and someone who works summers and breaks to pay for food during the year, I'm looking for a DEAL or at the very least, willing to pay the price for good food.  All I got was something overpriced and meh."
2,"Cafe Luna in theory has much going for it - trendy interior, good location in campustown, free parking, and an excellent wine list. That said, it seems that their tapas style menu is still needs a lot of work for the prices they are asking. I've been twice - each time fried foods have been either undercooked or soggy, cold dishes served at room temperature, the cds being played skipped. All of that said, the staff seemed distracted - which I could forgive if there were more than five people in the restaurant. I am giving it three stars as the menu is at least interesting and the selection of wine and spirits excellent. Otherwise, it would be a two star selection."
1,"Was down in good ole chambana visiting some friends and decided to go here for dinner on Sat night.  I had been to the old Cafe Luna when it was on Green St. in my college days.  Anyway, walked it, loved the decor!  We stood by the end of the bar waiting for like 5 minutes, someone came over and said someone would be over to help us.  Then we waited awkwardly for about 5 more minutes.  The same girl came over and was like, do you have a reservation?  We did not so she offered up the bar to have a drink and when a table opened we could sit.  We decided we were just going to eat and drink at the bar.  We got a bottle of chardonnay...it was pretty good and was glad that they knew that it was not oak-y.  We ordered a salad, melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns.  Well, the salad was pretty good..but how can you mess up salad.  The melting pot brie....DISAPPOINTMENT!  I was expecting some sort of fondue or something...well it was little potatoes that were halved and spooned out, filled with brie that was melted.  I guess I should have asked but I thought that the name was self sufficient...WRONG.  The potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it.  I must admit, when I eat brie, I want to EAT brie...I like lots of it.  So I guess that was a bad selection.  Then the \""prawns\"" came out....well it wasnt prawns at all.  It was one very small, what looked like, a crab cake, slathered in guacamole....weird....so we took a bite and were pretty confused so we asked about it because it said stuffed prawns on the menu...well, it so happens that they messed up the order and gave us the crabcake topped with wasabi guac...or something like that.  Their fault so they said they would bring the prawns right out....except the bartender came back from the kitchen and said that they were out of prawns but they could do it with regular shrimp.  We said fine.  They came out (four of them), not stuffed at all.  It literally looked like sauteed shrimp with a touch of crab meat around the edge...unimpressed.  Overall, the dinner was not that good and for the price of everything...it was really overpriced!  I liked the atmosphere but the food is less than desired and $$$.  However, the staff was super nice and always checking up on us.  I didnt have the heart to tell them that most of the food was not great....alas, I will not be going back to Luna."
4,"I absolutely think that Bombay Grill has the best chicken mahkani.  No restaurants in Chicago (even on Devon) can compare!  Or maybe I just haven't found that one perfect place in the city yet...\n\nSo anyways, when I was an undergrad, I luckily lived across the street from Bombay so I would come here all the time.  The manager knew me by my first name, hahahahha that was embarassing.  \n\nYes their prices can be a little expensive but I think it's worth it.  I love their garlic naan too.  What I hate about all indian restaurants is that everything is always separate--- naan, rice, etc.  Blah.\n\nAnyways, A+ for Bombay!"
2,"This place makes no qualms about itself. It is a solid Punjabi joint, creamy curries, paneer and all.  That said, it's rather lacking in spicy inspiration - both locations didn't feature any sort of kick to their curries.  However, the lunch special is all bang for your buck...I recently went here on a lunch meeting and my professor and I were able to split one plate and leave completely stuffed!  I'm glad the only real traditional Punjabi Indian joint in C-U isn't a disaster, but it's nothing to write home about either!"
4,"I would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice. The naan is really great too. I also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer, as well as the samosas. I am not an expert on Indian food so I can't tell you how authentic it is, but I can tell you that it is delicious."
2,"I reviewed this in 2009 to let people know that I got food poisoning here. I ate here again and am rating it more highly cause I ate the veg food and it was fine, but mostly because I highly approve of the quantity and quality of their rice.  Working class Asian Americans like myself love their rice and this place is super generous and the quality is very very good. Better than the entree itself in fact."
2,"generally okay place, a little overpriced for the settings:(  noisy and place is too small, not looking very neat... food portion is below average. maybe not again."
1,Boo notes and quotes for raising prices tenfold just b/c they were making illegal copies. No one should pay $150 for 100 pages of paper.
0,"Called from marketplace mall area... When i told the girl on the phone, she said that I was serviced by a different location and that they were closed.  Then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye.  Wow... No effort to satisfy a customer at all."
0,I really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible. I tried two dishes but both of them tasted real bad and smelled weird as well. Never go here. They have the worst food in entire Urbana-Champaign area.
0,"i recently went on thai food kick around town... and to make the comparison fair decided to have basil chicken in several places... Thara Thai, Nitaya Thai and Basil Thai in campustown. the latter (Basil Thai) is by far the worst. as one reviewer already wrote before me, this is made here with ground chicken which is tasteless, too little food, and covered in a litre of sauce/broth. WTF? the tables and chairs in this place also seem sticky... covered in some weird nasty film. in summary, two words: stay away."
0,"Ugh. A curry dish with barely any veggies? No, potatoes do not count. They're not green. Even some basil in this so-called  \""basil thai\"" restaurant would have been nice. Curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor. However, given a choice, why go and have bad food?"
0,"My first (and last) experience with Rick's was an interesting experience.  I am new to Champaign and called to schedule my BMW for repair to what I believed was a caliper problem.  I was told to have my tires checked first at the place where I bought them.  I explained that wasn't possible since I had moved from out of state and again repeated what I thought the problem was (I knew it was not tire related). I was again told to have my tires checked, but they did not do that there.  If there was nothing wrong, I could call him back.  Incredulous!!! Not only was he not \""super coffee-shop\"" friendly\"" as described by Tim J., but I got the impression he didn't want to be bothered!  I went somewhere else that promptly got my vehicle in ... and it was a stuck caliper!!!!  Since it was in for repairs, I also had them do some other maintenance work done - THEY  were great!  Rick's Automotive Service LOST OUT!!!"
2,"Went with a friend and got a Bento box (Salmon teriyaki).  Food was good, but the place is a bit far from campus.  I'm not a fan of Miso soup, but the rest of my meal was good."
2,"What we've ordered over two visits:\n\nSides: Fries (a bit undercooked, but decent). They're thick cut (very), like English fish & chips, and have seasoned salt sprinkled n top. The Mac and Cheese is the best we've found so far in C-U compared to the other Southern/BBQ places, but not as good as homemade. \n\n\""Seaboat\"" Sandwich - fried walleye with tartar sauce, lettuce, and tomato (one with cheese, one without) and a Cod Sandwich w/ tartar, lettuce, tomato, and cheese. \n\nThe fish is good- the batter is flavorful, and because everything is cooked to order, the batter is hot and crispy- not soggy, essential for a god fish sandwich! The cheese is 40 cents extra...and on my walleye sandwich, it one only one slice of American cheese,  over a sandwich that was about about the size of a good sub, 3\""x7\"", you could hardly  SEE the cheese, much less taste it, and I expect more when you're paying 40 cents extra! The cod sandwich portion is quite a bit smaller in size and is served on  a hot dog bun. I wish they would note this on the menu. FYI: the fish is served on wheat buns. It's the squishy and sweet bread that tastes almost the same as a white hot dog bun... I wish they had better bread. The tomatoes I've gotten have been mixed...some a bit overripe and generally thickly sliced. They use a green leaf lettuce (what you would use as a garnish), which tends to get limp/slimy fast on a hot sandwich- I think they would do better to use a crispy romaine or iceberg lettuce. The tartar sauce was decent and I like that they have hot sauce on all the tables. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small, just a few tables but it's very clean and the service is very friendly. You can call ahead for pick up and they have a drive through window for the call-ahead/take-out service. I wouldn't rec. for \""drive-thru\"" fast food- everything is cooked to order and you'll have a much longer wait if you're expecting McDonald's speed."
1,"Overpriced just \""okay\"" italian food.  My dinner included overcooked (mushy) pasta and overcooked shrimp...husbands chicken had gross fat and chewy sections.  Not worth the $50 price tag...should have ate at a local joint."
0,"I wish I could say something different than most of the other comments but alas I cannot. The service was the worst I have had in some time. We waited ten minutes for two glasses of sangria, when that finally arrived the waiter took our order (some couples combo that included an appetizer). The the size of my drink was quite small so I finished it rather quickly and waited for our server to have another ten minute personal conversation with the table next to ours meanwhile we were still waiting for our breadsticks and salad... After about ten more minutes the waiter showed up with the breadsticks and salad. At that very same time our main entree came out. We sent it back since we had not had our salad or even our appetizers yet. I then ordered another drink. Ten minutes go by while we gnawed on old cold breadsticks and soggy salad still waiting on my drink and our appetizers while intently listening to our waiter recall his hometown antics with the table next to us. Finally the drink and appetizers arrive after about five more minutes, shouldn't have waited for it though The ravioli was cold and chewy, I mean cowhide chewy... Then our main course comes back out. Back out as in from the heat lamp. One bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm. Needless to say after a small chat with the manager explaining how I would not return due to poor food and even worse service we left without being charged. In the end, save your time, save your money, and do not eat here, there are much better establishments in champaign."
2,"I love olive garden, but this one seems to have poor service.  The only reason why I keep coming here is for the salad and breadsticks.  I went here for my birthday this past Saturday and it was probably the best service I got and it still wasn't that great.   The wait wasn't as long as usual but that could be cause it's summer.  I wish they let us enjoy our salad longer, but that's probably cause they don't want us to eat several bowls of it cause it's unlimited"
2,I'm not the hugest fan of Indian food but if I had to eat it this is where I would go. They also have a few other dishes besides Indian which is nice. The food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic!  A lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd.
3,"Aw, yeah! I never will go to County Market for my meat shopping again! Old Time can meet almost all of your meat eating needs and they do have a customer appreciation card where you get 10% off your next purchase when you purchase $200 worth at the store. Their sausages are quite good and their special flavors (applewursts you should try for sure!) change but they still have the classic bratwursts and mild and spicy italian sausage. Their flank steak is also good and their bulk italian sausage is also worth your while especially if you make spaghetti sauce from scratch. My complaint is that their hours and location could be better. Their staff is always helpful and they can help with getting special meat cuts."
2,"Easy to schedule and they are the few shops that's open at weekends. \nTheir $50 special of oil change, tire rotation and wiper change is a good deal. Other than that it's pretty similar to other shops. \nLong wait sometimes. An hour wait for an oil change"
4,"This is a great store.  The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable.   They have a great selection of fish and supplies, as well as mice,ferrets,birds,reptiles,and hermit crabs.  If you have a problem with your tank, they will test your water and tell you how to fix it."
2,"I know Urbana is supposedly the artsy-fartsy Birkenstock side of CU, and so, while I understand why Art Coop would elect to move there and into the creepy old and largely deserted Lincoln Square Mall, I just miss their presence on campus. (doggone it, when I was a fine arts design major, the coop was conveniently located on campus and staffed by some of my quirky classmates and I felt at home inside the coop. Now, not so much. :/ )\n\nThe prices are not great, definitely higher than Dick Blick. And the assortment of weird and wonderful papers and tidbits also seems to have dwindled. Frankly, it's just as easy and more price effective to shop on line for the run of the mill basics.\n\nI miss the old school Art Coop. :("
0,"The man who was taking in my dry cleaning order was very short with me, rude, and then threw (literally) my clothes into a basket as I walked away. I asked if he could be more gentle with my clothes and he told me \""They're fine\"". I promptly asked for my clothes back and took them to Denny's on Mattis. Last time I use any Starcrest dry cleaning."
4,"The best vintage shop in Champaign! Scott and Amanda are always up for a chat about mid-century furniture, and are lovely people.\n\nFurniture Lounge is simply the best shop to go to if:\n\n* you are redesigning your home and need furnishings, lighting, decor\n* you are trying to find a unique gift for a friend or relative\n* you love thrifting, antiques, or vintage\n* you love mid century modern design\n* you want to look at something interesting and beautiful!\n\nThey recently started taking credit via Square reader in their new downtown Champaign location."
3,"The Merry-Ann's at Neil and Kirby is a standby.  I use to live near there and my neighbor and I would go there every Sunday morning.  The regular waitress was awesome and knew what we wanted.  It is the typical greasy spoon and I love it for that.  Got the t-shirt.  I've moved and have yet to find that certain place that gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that a omelette or diner's stack from Merry-Ann's can provide.  Forget your calorie-counting conscience at the door.\n\nI think the one downtown is okay, but because I heart the original so much, the dt one will never compare."
3,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday with my bf, and we had a pretty good meal. I'd been hoping to check this place out for a while, as it's located just three blocks from my apartment and I'd read good things about it. The food is French, mostly crepes, and pretty tasty. \n\nWe started with the pate appetizer, which came with cornichons, sweet onion relish, old-style mustard, and baguette: no complaints, it was very tasty. I then had the special French toast, which came with peaches: for some reason I expect fresh peaches, but they were canned. Still, it was pretty good. My bf got one of their loaded savory crepes, which had cheese, ham and a few other things, and I believe he liked it. We also had two glasses of French hard apple cider: delicious.\n\nSo the food was pretty good (but I still want to give it a try for dinner), and the service was also very friendly. Not too much of an ambiance, but it's still a good place to go."
3,"Love crepes! I've always eaten them as desserts with chocolate and banana nutella. I've been to Paris twice and make a point to eat them when I'm there, but these are pretty amazing! The lunch crepes are great, and you can even build your own. A lot of people complain about the price but I htink the ingredients are stellar and worth every penny. Not to mention, I love that you can see the kitchen, and the place is really cute and quaint. I definitely recommend at least trying it out!"
3,"I had a craving for Mexican food tonight... which happens rarely enough that I should I should indulge. I had no idea where to get good Mexican food in Champaign, but a quick Yelp search brought up Fiesta Cafe, which is conveniently located just a few blocks from my apartment, and also stays open everyday until 12am (an oddity in Champaign where a lot of restaurants are closed by 10pm). \n\nSo I decided to check it out: I didn't actually eat there, only got food to go, but the restaurant seems pleasant enough that I will probably go back soon. I ordered the chicken mole, and it turned out to be quite good... in fact, surprisingly good and quite better than most Mexican food I had while I was in NYC. It's also very reasonably priced, and the service was very friendly. Nice place!"
3,"Three stars for the food, and an extra for the great margaritas;\n\nFood-wise, I left full but don't remember being too impressed based on the number on the receipt, but the service I had was good.\n\nThey've got a wide selection of tequilas to fit you budget or tastes, and the mix was pretty good, too."
1,"This used to be a good money saving option that I frequently used to travel to Chicago on weekends despite the fact that I don't recall ever being less than an hour behind schedule.  Hey, gas isn't cheap and Amtrak was.  However, the weekend fares have gone up from $13 each way to $35 (!) unless you buy your tickets several weeks in advance.  So even though I have a gas guzzling SUV, it's only about $15 more expensive for me to drive and a heck of a lot more convenient and reliable.  Those with more responsible vehicles will save time, money, and headaches by driving.\n\nI have also, on one horrible occasion, had to take Amtrak to the east coast due to flight cancellations. It was a truly awful experience that I would not wish on my worst enemy.  A 20 hour train ride is bad, but when it ends up taking more than 30 hours and involves a 4 hour white knuckle bus ride through a blizzard in the mountains in the middle of the trip... yeah... not cool."
0,"I guess there is no way to really make Amtrak improve by making a one-star review, but I think it's awful how expensive it now is to go to Chicago given the quality of the service. I live in Stockholm now and was entertaining notions of going back to Champaign to do another degree, but really...it's an isolated place if you don't have a car. It shouldn't be a big deal to go to Chicago. It shouldn't use up all my money or my patience. I've had 11 hour delays on Amtrak! Chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city. The fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the University. \n\nSweden benefits enormously from having fast, relatively cheap, and hassle-free railway. I don't have to sit on a cramped bus next to a McDonalds eating elementary school kid or endure six hour delays on a crappy train to get to places like Oslo and Copenhagen. I'm bragging now, but UIUC needs Amtrak to shape up."
0,"After seeing the reviews of this place a friend and I decided to try it. We were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards. \n\nWhen we first walked in I totally thought of turning around to leave, but I tried not to 'judge a book by its cover'. So we sat down and the service was just terrible. He talked way too fast and barely gave us time to respond. Didn't like him at all. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered their special - eggs, sausage, American fries, and pancakes. EHHHHH! It was edible, sure, but delicious? Yeahhhh, no. I only ate it because I was really hungry and we had to pay for it anyway. \n\nThe only positive thing I could say is it is cheap, so if you don't want to spend a lot on breakfast then I GUESS you should visit this place. By the way, CASH ONLY!* Another problem we had here."
1,I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.
1,I always look for a nice pub when visiting different cities. I saw this while walking on campus and decided to check it out.... Staff not friendly or sociable... Maybe it's because Im from the south and use to hospitality ....but damn how about a smile and a conversation I WAS ONLY PERSON at the bar.. I even tried to get a convo going... I know my opinion isn't going to close the bar but as a former bartender who OWNs a company now .... Customer Service is what will make you $$$.
2,"This breakfast spot had big shoes to fill. The Le Peep up near Northwestern was one of my favorites. The menu was a bit pared down compared to its northern counterpart, but it had all the usual egg, pancake, and crepe dishes. You can also get flavored coffee, though with a few less options.\n\nI went for the irish benedict and a cafe mocha. Both were about on par with the usual high standards that come with the name. One issue was that the poach was perfect on one of the eggs but a little overdone on the other. Not a huge deal, but the yolk mixing with the corn beef hash is the star of that meal. \n\nThe only thing that makes Le Peep lose points with me is that I got tagged a little extra for exchanging the ever-present diced potatoes for fresh fruit. After corn beef hash, an english muffin, two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce the last thing I need are these dry, starchy and very overrated potatoes. I'm used to asking for fruit instead, and this is the first time I was charged extra. Wasn't happy about that, but it doesn't change the fact that I'll be back here pretty often."
0,"It's closed!  Thank goodness!\n\nI was hear once with some girl friends and a couple of guys started chatting us up.  During the conversation one of them started to look really ill, they were both obviously drunk, and before we knew it the ill-looking one was vomiting in the corner of our table.  It was disgusting.  \nWe immediately notified the bartender who then mopped up the vomit with a dirty looking rag and declared the table good as new for incoming patrons.  Needless to say, we warned the next people who attempted to sit there."
3,"I'd say this place is pretty hipster.\nNot just \""alternative,\"" like all the edgy people you can muster in CU come here - it has a real hipster attitude.\n\nBut I still love it.\nAll the beers. All the liquor.\nThe excellent beer garden.\nThe good tunes.\nThe creepy room upstairs for shows.\n\nCheers!"
1,"Blah everyone always wants to go to Mike and Molly's when Guido's and Blind Pig and Boltini and Cowboy Monkey are too full (that makes it, what, the fifth best bar in Champaign?) and I always get sad because it is so gross in there.  I guess maybe I was turned off the first time I went there when there were two port a potties, like, scaffolded on to the front of the building and like some homeless guys living in there?  That pretty much sums up the mike and molly's ambience for me, perma porta potties with homeless guys living in them.\n\nThey have a really, really great booze selection; a million beers, awesome bartenders every time I've been there, and a ZERO skank factor, but the grime is too much for me.  Even downstairs.  I went up stairs for the first time last night, hoping that when I got up there it was going to be some kind of comfortable hipster paradise, but instead I was just faced with a bunch of bacterial colonies in the shape of barcoloungers."
2,"It was empty when I got there to meet up with some people, but did get crowded as the night progressed.  The beer prices are on the wall, so they stay the same.  But depending on your bartender, the mixed drink prices changed throughout the night, which I am not a fan of.  It means someone is adding a little extra on for themselves.  And there was a definite difference in how much liquor each bartender put in.  In my opinion, both were pretty weak pours.\n\nMy friends ended up having to pay a cover for the bands, which was not fair because we didn't even venture upstairs.  Take the cover price upstairs for those that are actually going to see the band, not for those who just want to hang out downstairs.  \n\nThey have drink specials Sunday - Thursday, but none for the weekends."
1,"Jillian's offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest.  good bar entertainment options, not so great food...or service...or beer/wine selection.  \n\nbut none of this matters much, as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice (to paraphrase the News-Gazette article that announced the closure)."
3,Very good soup and fish dishes.
3,"Daily special number 1 is the way to go! It comes with half a mackerel, and a decent bowl of tofu soup. The mackerel can be dry at times though. The kimchi jjigae has a large portion and tastes good too."
2,We try and go there for the best fish sandwich in town ! Be sure and order the beer batter onion rings also. A quaint Illini sports bar with a nice atmosphere and  easy access. A pay parking lot is right next door.
2,"Ok beer selection, ok bar food (though I am a bit of a beer/food snob).  I don't mind going when a group wants to go, but not my first choice if I'm out on my own."
4,This guy really knows what he is doing.  I always feel better when I leave!
4,"So many lovely memories of going here twice a week (at least!) with my boy.\n\nWe would order strictly from the Korean Menu--if memory serves me right, \""intestine shaped like squirrel\"", anyone?\n\nExcellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment."
4,"The Tumble Inn is a no-frills sports bar on the edge of downtown Champaign - they have a bunch of TVs, a lot of domestics on tap, and there's usually a barbecue truck parked out front. I have been here on several occasions at off-peak times to watch sporting events, and each time has been thoroughly enjoyable."
4,"This is the fanciest library I've ever seen!  I haven't really been to many but compared to what this library used to look like before the expansion and compared to what I'm used to seeing back home, the Champaign Public Library is pretty cool.  \n\nMy favorite things about this library are:\n- Plenty of seating.  There are lots of open couches to sit on and read or tables to work on.  There are even quiet rooms if you need the extra silence.\n- The children's area.  I bring my son with me most of the time and he enjoys playing with the toys in there.  I'm still trying to get him interested in the actual books though.  They also have story time in a separate room there.  The rainbow lights of the librarian's desk also entertain my son.\n- The checkout area.  It's electronic and fully automated so that all you have to do is stick your library card in the slot, stack your books on the rubber pad, and get a receipt of what you checked out.  I've never seen anything like it.  What's comforting is that there are still some clerks at the checkout desk so that if you're like me and can't quite figure it out on your first try right there to help you.\n- The outside book return.  It's so simple and fun to watch (or maybe I'm just easily entertained...LOL!)  It's not right in front of the entrance, it's on the opposite side of the building, but that makes it easier to return your stuff because all you have to do is drive around to the other side.  You don't have to park or get out of your car.  You just drive up and hold your book up to the return slot and it opens automatically.  Then you just put your things on the conveyor belt and the slot closes and you're done.  Easy!"
3,"Compared to the malls in Springfield and Decatur, this one is the better of the three. There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc."
0,"Stay away from The Children's Place! There's an old bitchy lady that works there that's rude as all out!! I went there today to use a gift card that was given to my 5yr.old on his birthday to get him some p.j.'s.\nBefore I even walked through the front entrance, this wicked witch of the store comes rushing up to me and says,\""What're you looking for!!??\"" Not even a hello or good morning!  I told her that I was looking to get my son some p.j.'s, and with that she said \""OH... CARRY ON!\"" I was like, WTF!?  So I just blew her off and went on with my business thinking she was just having a \""senior \"" moment. But come check out, she said forcefully that needed my email address and phone number  to complete the transaction. I told her I just wanted to pay and wasn't interested in whatever promo they were offering. She then said with a huff, \""FINE!\"", and mumbled something under breath. \nI then asked her if there was a problem, and all I got for an answer was a serious glare with attitude! \nAll I can say is if this is the way this company trains its employees, I'm NOT shopping there again!"
2,Nice mall great stores and food court but they need more seating for people.
1,"Cheap and perfectly adequate. The kind of place you order from because it's close and cheap. If you're willing to travel farther, wait longer, or spend more, go elsewhere. But this is a fine option, and you can get a lunch special with an entree and fried rice for $4.50. I like the broccoli with garlic sauce--the sauce is good but not great, but the broccoli is perfectly cooked. Mmm."
3,"I really think this is some of the best Chinese food in Champaign. I was an Empire fan for the longest, but one dish from Number one Wok is definitely more savory than Empire or Evo in comparison. \n\nThey are a little heavy on their pork inclusions to fried rice and egg rolls, but I enjoy swine so the more for me."
2,"This is your basic mall fast food Chinese place. Don't expect anything more than that. That's why it's 3 stars. It's good for what it is, but it's pretty  much what you'd get at other Panda locations. The thing that struck me about this little food court counter is what you can't see from the front. I used to work doing refrigeration and commercial appliance repair in the area. This particular Panda location always had the cleanest and best maintained kitchen I've seen in the CU area, and I've been in a lot of them. Color me impressed."
2,"I want to give kudos to a young man named Zach who works at Lenscrafters in Champaign, IL. He helped me through a very frustrating experience in getting replacement lenses after cataract surgery. The young lady who approached me on my first visit told me that I needed a NPI number from ophthamologist who had performed the surgery. On my second visit after obtaining the NPI number, I was told by another associate that I also needed the after surgery cards that confirmed my surgery dates. I had not been told that I needed these cards on my first visit so I thought I would have to make a third trip to get my glasses. Zach stepped in to help and called my ophthamologist to get the dates over the phone. He works in the lab but he was working in the front office because they were short staffed. He literally saved the day for me. I would suggest to anyone who has a problem with getting their new glasses to ask for him if he is available. He is professional, courteous and knowledgable on Lenscrafters eyewear."
0,"I can't stand this place.... or maybe the corporation.  The past three visits there, I've gone in to get the latest Disney movie WITH a coupon.  First off, they never have the latest releases in a nice display.... they're hidden amongst other movies.  If you want the Blu-ray.... Forget it, that's in another part of the store.   \n\n\""You have a coupon to buy \""Peter Pan\""??   Well Ma'am, if you read the fine print, it expired yesterday... or your coupon is smudged from your printer and we can't scan it.... and if you read the SUPER FINE print, it says that it's not valid for Disney items (amongst 300 other brands)\""\n\n\""You have a coupon on your phone?  Sorry Ma'am, you have to print it up and bring it to us so we can scan the barcode (which is in perfect resolution on your phone screen) and just throw it in the garbage.\""\n\n\""Target AND Walmart are selling \""Little Mermaid\"" for a lower price?  Well Ma'am, you have to bring the ad in to us\""\n\n\""You have the ad on your phone??

0,"Do not stay here!! My boyfriend and I had ended up here after our 15 hour drive from Delaware to Illinois. We were going apartment hunting in Champaign the next day and completely forgot to book a hotel room for the night. Of course the next day was move-in day for the Illini so everything was booked for the night. When we went to book a room, the night manager informed us that the cost was going to be $85 instead of the typical price since it was a \""busy week and the price should meet the demand\"" (thanks for basically saying your screwing us over just because you can?). When we opened the door to our hotel room I was greeted with the lovely smell of cat pee and mold. I think we were in our room for 2 minutes before I saw a cockroach on the desk in the room. I screamed, my boyfriend squished it with a napkin. After that I refused to sleep there so we went to ask the manager for our money back. The manager inspects our room and says he can't refund us because we already \""used\"" the room (I had pulled back the covers of the bed to check for more bugs) and that he needed to see the cockroach to prove we were telling the truth. My poor boyfriend had to dig through the trash to show the manager the dead bug. The guy then told us to re-make the bed and we would get our money back. Seriously? Oh and he also informed us that the roaches are usually downstairs and he had an upstairs room available if we wanted it. No. Thank. You."
4,"Great atmosphere, delicious coffee, awesome food. This is my default stop for coffee or a place to spend the afternoon. It can get a little crowded at times though.\n\nThe Thai Tempeh sandwhich is amazing, also try the cold brew coffee sometime."
0,"This review is based on my experience sitting outside.  In the summer, as many others do, I enjoy sitting outside to meet others and have great coffee.\nUnfortunately, the majority of the tables outside of Cafe Kopi allow smoking, even though many of these tables are less than 15 feet from the door.  I have been sitting here for an hour and a half and I have not been able to enjoy this for more than five minutes, as the stream of smoking is constant.\n\nI would think that in this day and age, cafes would discourage smoking so as not to harm the health of other guests.\n\nThis is intolerable, and I won't be back to sit outside.\n\nCoffe is good, but my lungs are worth more."
2,Wanted Thai while on Champaign for work. Tried this place and it was good but very small portions. So much so that I had to get taco bell fourth meal 3 hours later.
1,"The first time I went to this place I was very disappointed.  I ordered Pad Thai with tofu for takeout and when when I got home, there was absolutely no sauce or flavor to the noodles at all.  I guess when you order it not spicy, they just don't add anything to it? On top of that, the texture of the tofu was a little off and it felt overcooked.  The noodles also had a weird rubbery texture I've never experienced before. It was edible, but not good.  Perhaps I just didn't order it properly? \nSo a friend was visiting and we both had a taste for thai food. Nitaya was on our way to downtown so I decided we could give this place another try.  This time, I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu again, but I told them to make it Mild.  It was better than the first time I had it, but still kinda bland. The noodles were again really rubbery and just not appetizing. The portions are also kinda small for the price. I've eaten at MANY thai restaurants and this is unfortunately one of the worst. \nSorry, Nitaya Thai, I'll be trying the other thai options in town next time."
4,"Their Kobe burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, pickles on the side, and hot fries are amazing. It satisfies the \""hard-core\"" hunger..making my mouth water even now. The service is straight forward, rapid and no-questions asked cooperative.\n\nThey have at least two large TV's with sports and the food network on them, it's fun to watch as you dine in. Farren's Pub is a flight of stairs down from the street level, and filled with indoor lights and good aromas. \nThey have hot tea for the non-drinker, and it's non smoking of course. Very cool place."
1,"I really don't get what the big deal is with this place.  I have had friends tell me thats they have some of the best burgers out there, but when i went there they were nothing special.  The place as a whole is just average: the setting, the service and the food.  This place is over rated."
4,"Seriously. Best burgers in town. The black burger is BOMB! Without that cajun remoulade, it's delicious, but with it, FREAKIN' FANTASTIC! The fresh house made potato chips are like crack with the black truffle sea salt they use. My heart was almost broken when they were sold out of chips, but the server (also the owner) said they could add the crack...erm... salt.. to the house cut fries. Wasn't quite the same, but it was still very tasty. Service isn't always super friendly, but I don't care when I get the best burger and chips in town. The burgers aren't the only good part. They have daily specials that have always been satisfying and unique. They also have some stellar dark beers. Wait time can be a little long depending on when you come, but it's worth the wait."
3,I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.
0,"I used to LOVE the Great Impasta.  It was my restaurant of choice.  If there was a night out to be had, it started here!\n\nHowever, as time went on, the food quality slowly started to slip.  They stopped warming the bread before bringing it to the table.  The service started getting harder to find.  Then, during my last two visits, the food came out luke warm at best.\n\nI loved this place in the beginning, but sadly had to say farewell.  I was sorry to see the larger location close, and even sorrier to find the new location still leaves much to be desired."
1,"Update - finally went to the new Lincoln Square Mall location. The decor is just awful, which is sad considering how nice the old place was. Cramped seating, depressing track lighting, drop ceilings, weird art right behind your seats so you keep bumping into it. They were out of the first two things I ordered (one was a special, so fine, but out of a basic bread-based app?)\n\nPasta took forever to come out, and my friend's was so cold that the cream sauce had congealed. Sigh."
2,"I've had good luck selling stuff here, but none when it comes to buying things. I just feel like everything here is either tacky, terribly made, or just an old trend. I definitely have better luck at TJ Maxx for sure."
3,"fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner."
0,"I probably would have given moonstruck threeish stars when it was open, but I can't give it any stars any more because it's closed!  That seemed kind of sudden!  I wonder what happened / what is going to go in there instead.  Panera pleeeaaasssseeeee."
2,"You were overpriced and full of yourself (Really, charging for wifi? meh), but you left us too soon, Moonstruck.\n\nI liked knowing that if i wanted to spend too much money and feel bad about it later, I could have a reliably delicious mexican mocha with some decent, high quality chocolate.  And your logo was cute.\n\nBut, you know, you could've been more affordable and less pretentious too.  That doesn't mean I wanted the gimmicky yogurt/chocolate/blah place to replace you, though. :(\n\nMoonstruck, your'e like that kid in high school I felt ambivalent about only to find out he's now in jail.  I'm sad for you, but not particularly surprised."
0,This place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls.  Not worth it.
1,"I must admit that I'm a little older and biased against the college bar scene. If I was in my early 20's, I would probably say that it's one of the best bars in town. It's dimly lit, there are beautiful intoxicated women, and the music is upbeat.  However, if you're in your mid 20's or older, this is not the place you would want to go. The floor is VERY slippery (sweat and spilled booze), the music is so loud you can't hear your friend's voice even though they're standing next to you, and the majority of patrons are under 21 (anyone under age 19 can enter a bar in Champaign). I'm also not a fan of cover charges, or at least they can charge those who are under 21 and let those of us who can exactly purchase our booze enter for free. Going to this place reminded me of why I don't miss going to college bars:\n\n1. Long lines\n2. Cover charges\n3. Youngsters who can't handle their overpriced watered-down liquor\n4. Even longer restroom lines\n5. Listening to ridiculously-loud music while patrons \""dance\"", a.k.a. \""dry hump\"".\n\nBottom line:\n\nIf you're a college kid between the ages of 19 and 22, this might be the place for you. But if you're older or not really into the \""club scene\"", go to Urbana or Downtown Champaign."
3,"Why did I come here: It was close by which is a plus for a student who lives in Campustown and wants to support something local.\n\nThey are open at good hours and I have never had a problem with getting an appointment. \n\nFor a GUYS haircut, it is the perfect price for what I get. I have gone to more expensive places in the NW for a similar quality haircut. It is quick too and I never wait long.\n\nThe stylists are nice and friendly. I love the joke one plays on me when they \""That will be a million dollars, please.\"" If you like deals and are willing to pay cash, you can get your 10th haircut free."
3,"OMG! Their cookies are delicious! I had the peanut butter cookie (awesome!), rice krispy treat (delicious!), ice cream sandwich (okay...), & the sugar cookie (pretty good...).\n\nThey do accept credit cards, but only on orders that are $5 or more."
1,"Seeing how little went into my quesadilla, I'm not comfortable with paying over $7. At least use a mixed cheese blend!  And seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla, I am really not impressed (you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food.)\n\nMaybe what distinguishes Qdoba are the burritos with their special combos, but I am nonplussed to try them again. Oh well."
4,"Best dental experience of my life! I hate going to the dentist, despise it even. From the noise to the taste, it's all a nightmare for me, but Shelly my hygienist and Dr. Kuo the actual dentist made my visit amazingly positive. The best part was that they even took my insurance without having to pay anything up front (unlike at other places that make you pay first, then get reimbursed later). Because of this latter fact, I have told all my coworkers about it! \n\nTrue, they do offer a lot of services that aren't covered, but they are just doing their job, you don't have to accept any of them, but to treat myself I got the fluoride treatment for only $25! I even learned a lot more about my mouth than my other dentist so I am now a super fan of flossing, brushing right, and eating things that are healthy for my teeth. I can't say that any other office made me feel as enthusiastic about caring for my teeth as this place. Plus they have the spit sucker instead of the little bowl on the side of your chair which means you can barely taste any of the junk they put in your mouth.\n\nDefinitely recommend!"
0,"What the actual F? I just got a random text message from these people advertising some special sale on tooth crowning. Seriously? This is what modern dentistry has come to? Blasting \""sales\"" for dental work via text messages? I was a patient there OVER 5 YEARS AGO. Why am I even on the spam list?\n\nShameful, absolutely shameful."
1,"The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok, nothing outstanding but not horrible. They have really good crab ragoons, and their jjajangmyeon is the best you'll find in champaign. In short: food is decent but service is horrible."
4,"I have been ordering food from Rainbow Garden for ten years. Their food is delicious, it's always hot, and delivery is fast! My husband loves the crab rangoon, and I don't think I've ever had a dish I didn't like.\n\nRainbow Garden is also a great spot for lunch. They have the usual lunch special: soup, spring roll and entree with rice for $6-$8.  The lunch specials are a great value, however they only include the common/popular Chinese restaurant dishes such as general tso's, princess, garlic sauce, etc.  If you want something different, you have to order off of the full menu.  But the food quality here is very good and everything tastes fresh.  I'm a fan."
1,"meh.\n\nif you are into hanging out with as many frat brothers as can be squeezed into a half block, this place is totally your jam.  \n\ni'm not.  \n\nit's crowded.  the service sucks.  the drinks are watery.  the food is just.... well, shitty bar food. and it's loud.  and did i mention crowded?  i am sure it appeals to a lot of people.... who go to college, wish they were in college, or wish they were boning someone of college age.... but man, i'm a realist.  that ship has sailed.  i was so hoping it would be a nice outdoor venue for people who didn't want to hit the campus scene.  it's not though.  it used to be.  now i avoid it like that plague.  \n\nif you are looking for a dj who cranks out the frat favorites of 2007 and does it loud and proud... you will love this bar.  if you are looking for a chill place to hang out with your friends and have a couple decent beers, there are other options."
4,"The better of the two Asian grocery stores on/around campus.\n\nI especially like that they have the kitchen appliances you can't find in a typical grocery store (like mini rice cookers, hot water pots, electric hot pots, etc.), and lots of random drinks, candies, snacks, etc. like a traditional store in Asia.\n\nTheir produce selection is probably smaller than Far East, but I still think you'd be able to find anything you could need here.  Plus, Am-Ko is just a much more pleasant place to shop as everything is organized well and it's just.... cleaner!"
3,"Cheap beer, dive bar, great company, and holy crap--did everyone just eat a hojillion peanuts and dump their shells on the floor?  Really? What the hell, it's a great dive bar.  I cant' even hate on it.\n\nThe booths are big and comfy, the setting is as nonpretentious as it gets, and the peeps are chill as hell--and most likely you're not gonna run into many undergrads ;)"
0,"Location is good, drinks are usually on the strong side...HOWEVER, the rude service you can expect to receive here, far outweigh the positives.  Every single visit to the esquire, I received unfriendly, uninviting service.  The crowd in this place is 40+ and unless you fall into this category, the staff will make you feel very unwelcome.  Every trip downtown, I want to give esquire another chance, and every time I'm disappointed."
0,"Um....Nope! \nThis place is in DESPERATE need of John Taffer. Bar Rescue is needed. (even though they are busy on the weekends- it saddens me that they could be making SOOO much more money. \n\nCleanliness- NONE! I get the peanut shells on the floor, that's one thing- Many places do this just fine and it doesn't come off as gross as it does here. I went on a Saturday night- about 9pm... about half full of people  the bar top was full of used napkins, straws, and empty glasses with ice and drink remnants, and everything was wet. oh and fruit flies- (in Winter!) fruit flies, fruit flies!! Strike 1. \n\nBartenders- I sat at the bar for about 12 minutes before anyone came and asked if I wanted anything, offered a menu, or anything. When the sloppy dressed schlub did come over he said- \""What do you want?\"" (there is no uniform for employees- which is confusing for customers. No shirt that says Esquire or anything- just a guy. I ordered a Blue Moon... A freaking TAP beer. as easy as you can get- When he returned with it, he just placed it in front of me on the wet bar- no napkin/coaster, the beer was flat, and contained a FREAKING lemon. Not an orange- a lemon. Boo. (Flat beer usually means dirty pipes or an old keg!) He just asked for money- didn't ask if I wanted a tab, or if I was ordering food, offer a menu...(which was my intention, but was never offered) was never approached again- about 15 minutes, drank my beer- and met friends at a different bar. I was sitting in this place for 27 minutes- and spent under $5- if you had a good bar staff- that would have easily been about $20 with an app. and another beer- and I would have asked my friends to come to Esquire.... and they would have spent money too.  \nCustomer service was crap. Strike 2. \n\nThe Look- is mismatched, ply wood, random cheap bar decorations. That Screams Dive Bar. I don't know how much this bar makes- but they could easily stand to spend 2-3 grand and do a minor upgrades so that at least everything matches. extremely unappealing- so many better options on the same street!  Strike 3.  \n\nYeah- not going back. Clean your place before someone get's sick!"
3,"Excellent pizza (full disclosure: I was a cook here) and decent beer selection. The pool tables make it difficult to socialize at time,  the bar space is too long and not wide enough. However, if you like pool, these are very good tables."
2,"Jupiter's is a fun place for families with younger kids, but it's not anything special for adults.  The food isn't spectacular, and the pizza is similar to Monical's thin crust pizza if you're curious what to expect.  There's a BIG arcade room with pool tables and video games, but this area gets PACKED if you go at a popular time of day.  I've only been to Jupiter's once, and I haven't really had the desire to go back.  The service was ok, but the atmosphere and food weren't anything special.  We also had a LONG wait to get a table and food."
3,worth the half off tues. guys... real cheese in those shakers. nuff said.
4,I am from Dallas and in Champaign for business.  I looked at Yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and Bacaro seemed to be the place to go.  I thought it was great.  Unique tasty dishes!
4,"Bacaro's cuisine is innovative and delicious! Appropriate proportions are creatively presented. Ingredients are always fresh and the specials take advantage of what's in season, putting subtle twists on traditional dishes that make you relish for the next bite! The service and ambiance are the tops! Clean, engaging art, cool bar! Thad the owner is most gracious and makes everyone feel like a guest in his home. The wait staff is most accommodating and shares in Thad's love for the culinary arts. Bacaro might remind you of a River North restaurant (Chicago) without the inflated cost. Great people watching can be had on their outdoor terrace."
2,"I had Saturday brunch here this week and was terribly disappointed.  In the past its Radio Maria has been nothing but fantastic, but all they had for the lunch menu was a set of sandwiches.  Really nothing exciting at all.  Make sure you check to see what they're serving that particular day before you go for lunch."
1,Awful place. \n\nIf you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level. Overall I left that place with $80 less and still hungry. Not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks.
3,I love this place.  My friends and I try to have a 'girl's night out' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere.  It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces.  The service is spectacular.  This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign
4,By far our favorite spot we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange - definitely new to the job - but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable. Very large beer selection as well. Highly recommend - we'll be back!!
2,"Some of the best cocktails in town. Only downside is some bartenders make them better than others. Love the mojitos! Reasonable prices. Nice decor. Nice crowd. Nice music. I went for brunch and had a lobster omelette.. I found it had a bit too many different flavors for my taste, but I'm sure others would love it, as I'm kind of picky. The guava mimosa wasn't too good though."
4,"Wonderful hummus and everything else, too!  Take your chances with the plate of a day, it's a bargain and an adventure!  And you'll get delightful hummus, pita, salad and rice along with the special items of the day.  The service can be a little slow since it's ONE MAN running the show but he takes his time with each person's order and serves up tasty plates!  The Arabian tea is also delish!"
1,"Blah. Stayed here over Illinois Homecoming weekend, and with my friend's wedding block rate it was still ~$90/night. The room was moderately okay upon first sight...but then things just started going downhill. There were cigarette burns on our blankets, a shower that looked like it had been pulled from a foreclosed doublewide and, much to my chagrin after realizing I had forgotten mine, NO HAIR DRYER. That made for a pleasant morning of tailgating in late October. \n\nThings didn't really get bad until the day we checked out and I noticed I had some sort of rash on my torso and legs. Are. You. Kidding. After Googling bed bugs for about 20 minutes I got an email asking to fill out a survey about my stay and was not very polite. Thankfully, I got an email from the manager shortly after who wanted to \""make things right\"" and ended up cutting my bill in half.\n\nSo....good customer service after the fact...not so great hotel stay. Never again. Until next year, that is, when I'm scrambling for Homecoming weekend accommodations without a wedding discount."
0,"Don't use this company. They don't put due dates on their bills and then get shitty with you when you don't pay your bill on time. How am I suppose to know what is ON TIME, if there is no due date. Also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile. A lot of chemicals in one pile results in DEAD grass. The technician with an 8th grade iq level didn't even bother to tell anyone. When we noticed it, we were offered a very small compensation for their incompetent workers."
0,"My girlfriend and I went out to celebrate that I got a new job, and were told this place was really good. We were sadly very disappointed. The decor of the place is really outdated, you feel like you went back to the '80s. While the waitress was really friendly, we were not pleased with the overall experience. My $6 beer was flat, the food was really overpriced and you had to pay extra to have it cooked. Yes, if you want someone to cook your food, you have to pay an extra $3. For that extra 3 bucks they don't even have a chef cook, just some cook who has no idea what he's doing. I ordered my steak medium rare and got it well done. The steak itself was nothing special and for a fillet it was pretty fatty. I will never be coming back and will recommend friends to never go there."
2,"If you want to cook a steak yourself but you're too lazy to shop and put in the legwork, this is the spot for you! They charge you extra for their chef to cook it. Very much a steak and potato place. We had a mixture of filets, ribeyes and sirloins. The cuts were really good, not outstanding. Beets, bacon and eggs at the salad bar was a huge plus. Skillet cookie was top notch. The manhattan was terrible. Quality establishment."
4,Amazing frozen custard. I like to stick to the basics -- vanilla or chocolate on a waffle cone. The stuff is just great.
1,"Time has passed this place by. I used to crave stopping here every time I was back in town. This visit, after a 2 year + gap, I went back on a Friday night. Oops! It was 10:06 so they were closed - the parking lot was full and there was a line at the windows, but it was past closing, so NO CUSTARD FOR YOU!. On Saturday afternoon they were open, so I ordered a one scoop waffle cone... and that's what I got for $2+ - a small round ball of chocolate custard sunken way down in a large waffle cone. Since Culver's has opened up where I live, I now have a comparison, and Jarlings is no better on the basic flavors. When Culver's has a special flavor - say Black Forest Tort, there is no comparison. As I said, the time has passed them by and all they sell is (a bit pricey) nostalgia. A Shame."
3,"simply fantastic, been here 4 days straight since they opened, the lemon custard is amazing in their banana splits. i would go EVERY DAY."
3,Seasonal place that is always a favorite. A bit off campus but worth the drive.\n\nTake your friends here when it's hot and you'll be guaranteed thanks all night.
0,Absurd wait time. We waited in a line of ~15 people for 45 minutes. I timed the group in front of us (5 orders). It took the cashier 11 minutes to put together five scoops of friggin' ice cream. No business this inefficient should be around. But obviously the ice cream is good.
3,Who doesn't love lemon custard?  So refreshing!  And really great in a lemon chiffon snowstorm.  The only negative is the long lines - but still worth it!
0,"Pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust. Other menu items are good as well.  The service consistently sucks!  It's horrible!  Every time, service is absolutely horrendous. Proceed with caution."
3,"One of the more \""adult friendly\"" mini-golf courses around. I disagree with other reviewers that the course is easy - I think it's rather challenging. Mostly because of small hills, and of course the dreaded waterfalls.. (getting the net to fish your ball out of the water can be a pain!) \n\nA lack of trees and shade on the course means you'll be stuck in the glaring, hot sun during the summer.. best to visit in the spring or fall when it's more comfortable. Also a plus: the course is open in the evening!"
1,"The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value."
3,"Very nice place.  Good atmosphere.  We were stuck at ADEd across the street for a conference and lunch was \""on you own\"".  Saw this on YELP and gave it a try.  Nice place, great view and good food.  It's a cafeteria, do not expect \""Nobou\"".  For what it is, it's very nice."
2,"Situated between Amsterdam (a gay club the girls wanted to hit up, but was empty) and Club Downtown (a club with a patronage that looked ghetto-fabulous), Palazzo ended up being the perfect fix for our Saturday night...\n\nTo look at it, Palazzo seems small in comparison to its neighboring clubs, but the space inside is used well.  Quite simply, there's a small bar to the left, a small VIP lounge to the right, and nothing but dance-able space in between. With a high ceiling, liberal use of bright neon blues, mirror'd-shiny surfaces, and sleek furniture, the atmosphere is energetic and cool.\n\nThe DJ, perched in a second floor booth overlooking the dancefloor, played track after track of Hip-Hop, for the most part. [From reading other reviews, I'm not sure Hip-Hop/R&B is part of the regular format. We'd been there the first week of Oct'09.] And so, the girls (Esco, RB, Becca), all talented and passionate dancers, took to the floor, wowing and attracting a perimeter of onlookers.  I danced a bit, broken ankle be darned: it'd take more than crutches to keep me from having a good time with my peeps...\n\nAs I sat for a minute, resting the cast'd ankle, a group of people complimented the girls on their style and dancing; very friendly, flattering gesture.\n\nBy 3AM, it was almost exclusively the 6 of us still on the dance floor being silly, and though we could have danced more, we had liquor at the apartment where the club had made last call around 2am.\n\nFun night and a fun little spot, but I'd suggest going with a group; friendly as people were, I'm not sure how apt this scene is to mingling/meeting/dancing with others. We had smilingly and genuinely asked a group of people watching us (the crew that complimented the girls on their dancing) to join us on the floor, but they didn't.\n\nIf its not your speed, there are two other clubs literally next door.\nAs we left, we noticed Club Downtown next door was *still* poppin'.\n__________________________\nSmoothest \""I got hit on\"" moment ever.\nCan't be simply re-told, only re-enacted."
3,"The Wild Thaiger is one of my new favorite places.  Every dish I've tried as been excellent.  They accomodated with some grace a friend with food allergies and were polite -- too polite -- in serving me as I (unknowingly) arrived just at closing.  The peanut sauce on the satay is amazing.  Pad Thai is a standby at a Thai place, but it definitely does not disappoint here.  The beef curry was excellent.  The ginger fish dish less remarkable but still good.  Coconut ice cream dessert is good for putting out the fire.  Good place to go after an Art or Heard museum visit."
2,"I had high hopes for this restaurant.  It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.\n\nI'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.\n\nI opened my green curry and said: \""WHERE'S THE SAUCE\""?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....\n\nThe Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhile I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.\n\nOverall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion."
3,"The food here is absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend their thai green curry (has a nice spicy kick to it), and the pad thai is worth a try as well. Unfortunately, the service is incredibly, incredibly slow."
3,"Ive only been here once for dinner but I go alot for lunch, I work in the area. Its always fast, sometimes gets a little busy but Ive always been able to eat and get back to work in an hour. I usually get the yellow curry or pad thai. Its good food. Not spectacular thai by any means."
0,"Eeeeee. Long yet important message to follow!!\n\nIf I was blind and If this place gave me the ability to see again.... Eeeeeehhhh I still wouldn't go back.\n\nThe first time I went, a few years back it was good. Good food! Then got take out and yeah, just well cooked good food. Nothing to write home about but still good. \n\nThis time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor. \n\nThe hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess. \nCurry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing. \n\nThe waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. \""I'll be back\"" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie. \nWell waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.   \nThen I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced. \nSo in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!! \n\nAnyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.\n\nStill\nWait\nIng\n\nOh wait I forgot the rules of the game.... I got up to search for the check. Yeaaaa! At what point do I win? And really what could the prize be?   Oh nothing. I guess you could say I win by not ever having to go back there. \n\nSad really. Was a good place. I understand running a place like this has challenges but no care was shown from beginning to end about the customer experience. Oh well except for the bus lady she was cool.... Maybe she should own the place? Winning! \n\nAnd I'm out!"
1,"I went to wild Thaiger for dinner with three friends and although the service was good in a clean environment, the food was disappointing. The flavors and preparation is just not authentic. I am reviewing the food with the background of having traveled to Thailand and having lived most of my life in larger culturally diverse cities (NY, Chicago, DC) with close authentic thai food. Here are some critiques:\n\nPad Kee Mao - My favorite noodle dish of all time is supposed to be prepared with thick rice noodles sauteed to a variety of textures, and infused with a dizzying array of spice. Instead, the dish here is made with thin vermacilli noodles and tasted like a lump of wet ricey dough. I even explicitly asked for it to be extra spicy, but there was barely any.\n\nPad thai - This basic Thai staple was presented as a soggy clump of noodles with a watery sauce pooling at the bottom of the plate. The worse part was that despite all of that sauce, it was tasteless except for the peanuts sprinkled on top. There was no hint of tamarind or fish sauce or chili. Disgrace.\n\nTom Yum (chicken) - Again, what we received was a flavorless broth. There was no taste of lemongrass, no curry, and the chicken was dry.\n\nNeedless to say, this was very disappointing. For a large restaurant in a prominent location, the food served up here was worse than some of the shacks I've eaten out of in other cities.\n\nTwo stars for service and cleanliness alone, none for food."
1,"The food looked great, but unfortunately we didn't get to try it because of the wait.  \n\nThe wait, of course, doesn't deserve the two-star rating - but the service does.  We waited for almost 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the angsty teen hostess with glazed over eyes, only to be told the wait would be 45 minutes.  Lazy Thaiger."
0,"Wow. I have been going to this practice for 3-4 years. I have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all. I just called and explained to the person at the front desk that I have been having some breast pain and didn't know if I should come in earlier than my Oct. 1st  Well Woman exam. Her response was, \""Well, if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit.\"" I said, \""well if I wait I'll just talk to her about it at my Well Woman.\"" Her reply, \""if you talk to her about it then, then you will be charged extra.\"" My reply, \""just for talking about it??\"" Her reply, \""yup, I don't know what to tell you. Just go to your primary care physician.\"" I then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue... No response. Her overall tone was brash, rude, and short. Did I mention uncaring.\n\nUnbelievable. Never, ever have I been so appalled. A woman calls and says she has breast pain and isn't sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds!! I'm outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office. I think Dr. Johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients."
3,"Safeway's are great now..  they have re doen the insides and put in a nice deli type place... they offer pre-made salads that are actually good, fresh sushi, good sandwiches and wonderful soups... since i work in the area i eat lunch there alot and am happy with the price and selection..."
1,I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them. I show up and no sandwiches! No order! Nothing! They also wrote pick up time wrong on another order so us two customers were fighting to get our orders made first. On top of it all customer service was rude. Bad experience all around! The only reason for the two stars is for the poor deli staff working furiously to make 100 sandwiches in no time flat.
0,"I have to search long and hard for things in this store that don't expire the day I'm purchasing them. They don't have a lot of the things they offer in their weekly ad, which I try to plan my grocery list around. The lines are always SUPER long. The store is always dirty. I keep telling myself I'll go to another store but there isn't another one in the 'hood to go to, so I'll need to make a better plan to head further away for a better experience in another chain. I've tried to talk to assistant managers about my issues at the store and have been blown off or they act afraid and stutter a lot. \n\nThe only good news: The gentlemen that bag groceries and collect carts are VERY nice and helpful."
3,"Accommodating to gluten free needs. Fish tacos, chips, & salsa were great. Service excellent.  Also liked the complimentary chocolate tamale dessert."
2,"This place has the potential to be great!! However, it's not. The chips and salsa and atmosphere are definitely a reason to go! The best I've ever had!!!! The first trip there provided a waitress who never brought the cheese dip we ordered. When I asked her to take it off our check, she said, \""ok\"".  Never an apology or \""oh my gosh! I forgot!\""  Nothing. She came by a couple of times to refill the empty water glasses them disappeared until the food and check were brought out. \n\nGiving them the benefit of the doubt, we went back the next day. Again, beautiful atmosphere from the patio. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS!!!! The food and service were mediocre. I had the chicken sandwich which sounded somewhat healthy but came out greasy. \n\nSo my advice: go!! Get the chips and salsa. Although I didn't have one, I hear the margaritas are good, too. Enjoy the patio and beautiful Phoenix weather. Just don't expect too much from the rest of the food or service."
1,If you come here to dine in close to closing time DO NOT sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the Latina hussie behind the counter.
4,"I wasn't completely sure what to expect when I went to the Heard Museum, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed myself.  We were there for almost 2.5 hours and the time flew by.  The permanent exhibit was laid out nicely and I truly learned quite a bit that I did not know previously about Native Americans.  In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the \""children's area\"" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.\n\nAdult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier, the guy was like, \""oh that's OK\"" and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there, but I never felt rushed or that I was in someone's way, which I think speaks highly of the layout.  I definitely recommend the museum if you have an afternoon you are looking to fill and/or just want to learn more about Native Americans."
3,"For an in depth knowledge of the cultures, the arts and anything related to Native American history, this place provides all that and more.\n\nIt's $15 for admission and $7.50 for students. And there is free parking on their parking lot. They also have a cafe, a book store, and and a museum store too.\n\nThey have 2 full floors of artifacts, rugs, clothing and a section devoted to learning every different type of tribe in the south-western region of the continental United States.\n\nYou can definitely spend a couple of hours here and be immersed on anything and everything related to Native American art and culture. There are a lot of \""hands on\"" exhibits as well so you can learn stuff by touch it.\n\nDozens of paintings, head masks, a whole room devoted to doll collection and much much more can be found here. They also show the transition of how the Native Americans became \""civilized\"" by forcing them into schools and acting properly in the general population.\n\nOther favorites include the rugs room where all the rugs were pretty much made by hand and they all looked pretty neat.\n\nThey have museum store as well where a lot of the stuff made by Native Americans can be sold here. Although most items are pretty expensive."
3,"If you're new to the area, visiting from out of town, or even a native, you need to check this place out.  I have gone twice and have left extremely impressed both times.  The atmosphere is so amazing.  Right away, just walking through the courtyard to the main entrance, there's so much beauty to take in.  You'll walk past the courtyard cafe, cantina, bookstore, and gift shop on the way to the main entrance.  Both times I've gone, I did the museum first and then the shops and cafe afterwards.  \n\nThe entire museum is somewhat of a maze and, if you're not on a guided tour, can be pretty confusing to navigate.  We didn't have a tour guide either time -- they're free and on a regular schedule, but we preferred to wander at our own pace.  The first floor is very large and divided up into sections.  There's a lot of baskets, pottery, and katsina dolls to check out, and some really interesting native american history to take in.  I learned a lot about the local and native history.  The first floor (to me) gets boring kind of quickly.  A lot of the collections are not as old or historic as I had expected.  It seems like the younger visitors enjoyed the first level more than I did.\n\nThe most impressive part of the museum for me was the 2nd level.  I was in complete awe of the Indian Boarding School exhibit.  I learned SO much about the Indian Schools that I had never even heard of before.  I really wish they would have taught us about this experience when I was in school.  It was AMAZING.  \n\nOverall, the museum experience was very good.  We learned a lot and really enjoyed the history, art, and culture.  The only thing I don't like about the museum is navigating through it.  They do give you maps and offer guided tours, but it's fairly difficult to navigate if you don't know where you're going.  I don't like to look at maps, I prefer to wander.  Different areas are not very clearly marked.  You'll see a door in a hallway and wonder what it leads to, then walk through and realize you're entering a completely different part of the museum.  It's kind of hard to explain, but I wish the areas were more clearly marked.  It's not really big enough to get lost in, but we definitely had several occurrences where we weren't really sure where we were or where we were headed.\n\nThe 2nd time I visited, we decided to have lunch at the cafe and we were really impressed.  The service was great and the prices were MUCH more reasonable than we had expected.  We figured it would be pricey, but it was not.  I had the smoked salmon quesadilla and it was outstanding.  \n\nThe museum shop is pretty typical from what I've experienced at other museums -- a few knick-knacks that are in my price range, surrounded by ridiculously high priced pieces of art/pottery/dolls/rugs.  It's REALLY neat to look at but I couldn't imagine buying anything other than a magnet or a coffee mug.  Some of the pieces are thousands of dollars, but it's awesome to just look and admire.\n\nOverall, always a great experience, easy to find (there's a light rail stop right out front), and it's also very close to other touristy places if you're visiting and want to experience Phoenix.  I highly recommend this place."
1,Good for only one visit.  Very overpriced
1,This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  \n\nThe outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.\n\nMy hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  \n\nMy girl Jacqui liked her entree.
0,"I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \""I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\"" template.\n \n Majerle's is one of those experiences.\n\nI know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.\n When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.\n \n   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. \n  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. \nNot so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.\nDownright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.\n If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not."
0,The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.
2,"We went here yesterday before the baseball game for lunch. I had a bacon burger, my mom had a french dip, my step dad a reuben and my daughter a cheese crisp. I also substituted my fries for cheese fries. \n\nPositive: the bacon on my burger was AMAZING!!!, the fries were crisp fresh hot and they gave you a lot of them, the staff was super nice, we could sit where ever we wanted (but there wasn't many people there yet), they had a good variety of things on their menu and drink menu, they had pretty good drinks specials. the au jus for the french dip was tasty, my step dad recommends the reuben and my mom agreed (I didn't taste it because I dont eat sauerkraut) \n\nNegative: the cheese fries stunk... I think it was the cheese they used (a kind of cheddar) but I wished I had just got regular fries after they came, the cheese crisp was over cooked and cold, my mom did not like the sandwich part of her french dip (just too boring and she even added mushrooms and onions), and the prices were well kind of over priced (I didn't think my burger was worth 9 bucks) \n\nIt was good, but I think I would only go back to drink alcohol."
3,"Ordered a burger, and it was GREAT!  Thought it'd be a typical sports bar type burger, but it tasted pretty gourmet.  Decently priced drinks, and walking distance from the arena.  Will definitely stop by if I'm ever in the area for a sporting event again."
3,"I came here a couple of times while on vacation catching a few suns games and have always left happy.service is good,food is good and atmosphere is great.actually got to meet thunder Dan and do shots with him wich was pretty unreal.its a sports bar so don't come here expecting anything more than bar type food"
3,"With a fun and upbeat bar area, this place is located in downtown Phoenix, close to the US Airways Center. It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked. \nThey have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking. \nI ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good. The cilantro sauce that came with it was  a little thick and tasted more like ranch, but the salsa was ok. \nAll in all, I had a great time there and the bartenders were all very friendly and attentive."
3,This is never a bad spot no matter the time of day. Seriously.
0,"Booked online for an 8:15 a.m. ride to the airport.  The site gave me a confirmation number.  At 8:18 a.m., we called in, and an automated message said a cab had been assigned and was on its way.  At 8:30 a.m., we called in again and noticed that the automated message said that \""cab zero\"" was assigned, which didn't sound good, so we spoke with a human who said that the online submission had not specified a regular or special cab.  I was pretty sure I had specified \""regular cab\""--but if there was some uncertainty, why not call me at the phone number provided, before the time I was expecting a ride?  We ended up having to drive to the airport and park in short-term parking for a week in order to catch our flight.  Discount Cab, by contrast, has always shown up reliably on time when booked via their website, and I will use them from now on."
3,"I am a sucker for antiques and historic anything - one night after a heavy boozing session in downtown Phoenix, I decided that rather than risking a DUI or calling a friend to babysit, that I would find the most affordable hotel that wasn't a shit hole. Hotel San Carlos had sweet rates, so this was the spot. \n\nBefore coming here I knew nothing about the history of it.. so I wasn't in it for the ghosts, although my wallet went missing, so could it be the spirit of Leone Jensen that was to blame? I will never know. I ended up getting the King Suite, for the same price as a regular room. Blame it on my abilities to get whatever the hell I want is up to you, but the guy at the front desk was more than happy to upgrade. Score.\n\nOnce inside the room, I was taken aback by the beautiful crown molding, Victorian decor, original radiators heating the room, vintage bed canopy and of course, the antiques that were scattered about. It reminded me of one of my old apartments in Boston, plenty of history to give me that sweet sweet feeling of being back in New England. This was what I dug most. I am not sure how big a normal room is, but the King Suite was pretty spacious. A loaded bar, with stools and all, living room area with a pull out couch, tv and footrests,  an armoir for hanging my clothes, which I didn't use obviously..  I snooped through every nook because it was all so old and interesting and mostly because im nosey. The bed was friggin' huge.. assuming they named the room after the bed would not be totally out of the question. \n\nHere come the complaints...\nThe pillows.. my god, they were so hard and gigantic (that's what she said). I ended up having to use a throw pillow from the couch to rest my head comfortably for I am a small human being with a tiny neck. The bathroom entrance has a step up that is about 10\"" high which I am surprised I did not stumble over and fall face first into the toilet followed by a broken nose and bleeding knees in the middle of the night. And lastly, had I of slept in 10 minutes more than I did, I would have been awoken by the sound of the maids vacuuming through the paper thin walls.. There is very little privacy in that sense. \n\nOther than that, the staff were so nice, and it was decorated beautifully for the holiday season. I hear the pool is rad, and how can it not be when Marilyn Monroe herself took a dip in it once upon a time? Other celebs have shacked up here as well.. Mae West, Jack Dempsey, John F. Kennedy and one of my faves..  Clark Gable. How cool is that! \n\nCome to think of it.. I did hear the sound of little children talking and laughing as I was leaving that morning, which I blamed on something outside not knowing the story about it being built on the first schoolhouse in Phx and over some sacred wishing well? Maybe I did experience a little paranormal activity, without even knowing it!\n\nI will certainly be back!"
1,"We stayed here for the recent Phoenix Rock and Roll marathon.  The hotel itself is \""boutique\"" as the website says, yet it has paper thin walls and we could hear the drunk people come home at 2am the night before our 8am race.  In addition, this hotel was listed on the race website as a good place to stay, YET when we returned back from the race (which ends in Tempe and requires a 45 min train ride back), our hotel room door was locked with our stuff inside.  We were then charged an additional \""1/2 day\"" fee in order to get our stuff out and shower rather than having a late check out.  There is a Hyatt and a Westin near by ...stay there!!!!"
2,A little pricey for the lack of amenities but the history of the hotel made it worth one night stay. \nTiny room.\nSimple bathroom.\nDid have a bar with food open late so that was great. \nI didn't get to their pool but heard it was nice.\nRoom seemed clean to me.\nGreat location! Walking distance to everything downtown.\n\nBeware! I was quoted one price on the phone but when I went to use the yelp promo they bumped it $10 bucks. Not Cool!
0,"= = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  :-O  = = = = =\n\nOk, the old Hotel San Carlos here is serving a weekday lunch buffet, so of course I stopped in to try it.  Today was Mexican food day, & they had a small setup of 16 items, which might be ok as long as the food is good.\n\nI started with some of what they said was Tortilla Soup, in a styrofoam bowl.  Next, there was a bit of salad, & then it was on to the refried beans, which were cold, tasteless, & the consistency of the clay we had back in grade school.  They also featured nearly tasteless chimichangas, enchiladas, & tacos.\n\nOver at my table there was a pitcher of WARM water to drink!\n\nThe service was awful, & so was most of the food.  Factoring in price ($7.99), it was worse than Taco Bite!     :-O"
1,"Blah...Very disappointing. I ended up at the San Carlos when it was the only hotel downtown that wasn't sold out. I don't think it was worth the $200 a night, but I didn't have a choice. \n\nThe shower was amazingly tiny. I felt like I was being frisked up against a wall just to wash my hair.\n\nThe walls are super thin. I could hear snoring from one room, coughing from across the hall and the TV on the other side....just awful.\n\nThe staff wasn't very helpful---forgot to program a wake up call, refused to assist when an alarm had been going off in another room for over an hour in the middle of the afternoon, etc. \n\nThe ghost lounge was very cute...I went down and it was a swing night which seemed to be fun. \n\nI'd be willing to come back to the lounge, but not the hotel for sure."
4,"My mom and I have been faithful clients for over 10 years, and I don't think that will ever change! I am guilty of bringing too many pictures that try to show what I want in my next haircut, and they always go above and beyond and give me more than what I expected. I've had a pixie cut, asymmetrical bob, bangs, and highlights done, and I loved each and every change I made, thanks to them.\n\nTheir massages before they work on your hair are AMAZING. I tend to doze off, and by the time I have to get up to walk to the sinks, I miss it already! Their tea is refreshing, and the salon itself is really hip and modern. It's quintessential Downtown.\n\nI always feel pampered when I go. They know what they're doing, and they're great at it. The price is definitely worth it, because unlike most salons, the work lasts and your hair leaves healthier than it did before."
0,This place does not even deserve one star. The place was dirty and the service stunk.
2,"It's so, so mexican food. My husband loves it- I think it's a bit greasy. La Canasta on 7th St is way, way better. The salsa they put on the table is a little too hot for my taste as well."
0,"Still on the quest for good Mexican food, I tried this place with a coworker who swore that I would love it.  Not so.\n\nWe went at lunch and the waiting area was packed!  We put our names down and they called us 10 minutes later (not bad for how many people were waiting).  They have a large dining area and lots of parking.\n\nWhen we sat down, they brought us chips and salsa and soup.  The soup was yummy.  The chips were disgusting -- you could taste the grease that they were fried in (YUCK!).  \n\nI ordered the beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch special.  The taco was decent (very small) and the cheese enchilada had onions in it which were crunchy when you bit into them.  I thought I ordered a cheese enchilada but I guess they forgot to put cheese AND onion enchilada on the menu.  I still judge a place by it's beans and these were nasty.  You could taste the lard.  My coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special.  She didn't like her food either.  \n\nAfter we left, she apologized and admitted she would probably never go there again either."
3,"AWESOME. \n\nAnd sometimes when it's really busy, they take you to magical rooms of the building that you don't even know exist for extra seating. \n\nBut really everything is good here."
4,"The only reason why checked this place out was because it was features on that show \""Man Vs Food\"" well, I wasn't disappointed. The place was nice and friendly staff. So much to choose from. You better have a appetite for this. Unlimited chips and salsa can't go wrong with that. \nReasonable food and prices. Definetely coming back. Happy customer."
3,"This is old-school Sonoran food. It's good! Hot sauce, chips, guacamole (though I think it has sour cream in it), enchilada sauce (both green and red), tacos, crispy cheese crisps, tasty medium-heat green chiles -- all good! \n\nThe only item that was lesser to my taste was the chile relleno, though the red tomato sauce on it was delicious.\n\nGive it a shot. There's a reason why this restaurant has been successful for so long."
4,We saw Mary Poppins and three generations of us loved it- the show stealing was accomplished by the ensemble cast with this one. The star roles were also awesome but the ensemble scenes blew me away.
3,"I grew up eating Chico's Tacos (I'm not old, lol), and it's definitely one of my favorite quick Mexican food joints. The salsa bar is fantastic. I suggest the beans (no lard!), shredded beef tacos, the Achiote Chicken Salad (yum!), the cheese enchiladas....\n\nI need to add though, Management changed last year and they sadly adopted flashy, in-your-face menu boards and jacked their prices a bit. No bueno. I haven't been much since it changed but it's still good."
3,"MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.\n\nThis is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos. \n\nThey have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.\n\nThe portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.\n\nThe tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.\n\nThe California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.\n\nThe restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.\n\nAnd if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)\n\nPS I think they are closed on Sundays"
2,"I am an avid Mexican Food Eater so this restaurant honestly caught me off guard a little bit and I have dined here twice, once by myself for lunch and then once for dinner with my boyfriend. \n\nI originally discovered it with the intention to go to Subway (next door) but then decided to try this place instead. The restaurant is a decent size but definitely gives off that hole in the wall mexican vibe that always makes me excited to taste their food. \n\nThe staff there is decent, they were not overly helpful but not downright rude either. I was a little put off the first time I went there because their credit card machine was down and so they asked to write down my card information and charge me the following day (but in the end that's exactly what they did and I didn't have any issues with it). So I agreed and ordered the cheese enchilada meal with rice and beans. I feel like for what I received it was a little overpriced. The enchiladas were pretty good as were the beans and rice (with salsa from their salsa bar of course). I really enjoyed the salsa bar. \n\nThe second time I went for dinner with boyfriend and ordered the taquitos. Again a little overpriced for what I got but they weren't terrible. My boyfriend got the taco dinner and he enjoyed it. \n\nOverall the food is average and a little overpriced but decent if you have limited time and need a Mexican Food fix."
1,"Stopped at this place on the way to PHX airport.  Looked like a local joint but got inside and realized it is probably a chain.  The salsa is accessible and acceptable.  I got my tacos to go.  No lengua or barbacoa and that clued me in that it must be a chain and sanitized to some degree.  Plus the fact that some non-hispanics were working behind the counter.  Got the airport and looked at the tacos and realized that the chicken was overcooked and the chunks too large for a taco.  Anyway, not the great Mexican food I have grown accustomed to when traveling in AZ."
4,"Best teriyaki chicken in town!\n\nNot sure what it is about the teriyaki sauce but it's perfect! The chicken is always tender and I've never had a bite with fat on it. Even the side salad is great, this coming from a guy who doesn't care for many things green... \n\nThe owners are extremely caring and the food shows their attention to detail!\n\nWell done!"
0,"WoW,  one star! Those are very rare for me, but here's why. The place its still looks really good and feel about it. The waiters are ill-trained. I came here with a groupon/google offer. I've always wanted to see what it is all about. I am so thankful that I was only out a few bucks and didn't have to pay full price. They screwed up my bill and took FOREVER to fix. Had to get the manager, who was very nice but about as incompetent as the serving staff. The food is very bland, the customer service is NOT horrible, but as bland as the food. Good news, I got my bill fixed after having to get in the manager involved and after a really long wait. With so many places in the vicinity don't waste your time or your money."
2,"When going here before a Diamondback game, don't expect fast service.  Sure, they are trying to do all they can, but dang - there are a LOT of you!  Suns games are pretty bad too, though when comparing sold out games, there are just more Diamondback folks trying to get in.  The nice thing is, Suns fans want to get out of there and head over before tip off.  Most Baseball fans will head over where whenever they're done because they know they have a good 8 hours to go.\n\nOk, lots of sports detail I know.  But w/ Jackson's on 3rd, it's all about Sports.  If you're thinking of heading over, check the sports schedules in the area before you make any firm plans. \n\nBesides that - huge bar.  When it's empty (a non-game day) it seems even bigger.  But that can work great if you want to meet a crowd there for a non-sports event.  The dance club space has been a bit more hit and miss over the years.  It went from lame to cool to not so hot to, well maybe if we're in the area anyhow...  Who knows where it will be when you go, but it's a decent sized space, a big bar and a good amount of seating so you'll definitely get your drink on, even if you don't get your groove on."
1,"You would think that a place that has been open, in this location as long as they have might have a few things figured out.  Hey Management, here's a few pointers for you:\n\nWhen there are events downtown, people WILL show up.  Stop looking so shocked.  We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.\n\nWe rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.  \n\n$12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.  \n\nThe seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have \""servers\"" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can't handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn't unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.\n\nI won't be going back anytime soon."
2,"As a tourist we stopped here before leaving the Phoenix area. It had great parking garage above the Restaurant and was told by someone that it would be validated. Turned out the Restaurant only validates half of if. Ugggh. \nWent in side, cool looking place. Fairly packed on a Sunday. Ordered our food with a nice waitress. We had chips, very watery salsa. Not very good. Our food came out fairly fast, and then the Mariachi started I really liked that. My lil niece enjoyed it as well. \nThe food was good and satisfying. But the did notice the menu is all over the place. Burgers, sandwiches, Mexican food. If I am in that area again, I would go back to try again."
4,"I have been going to the Matador since I was in grade school. They have consistently good no-frills Mexican food and I much prefer it over the chain locations that are around. It's a nice large location downtown and has been renovated since many of the reviews on here were posted. Yes, the service has been slow from time to time over the years but I haven't ever had any more trouble here than at most other restaurants. It's a locally owned family business that has been in the family for over 30 years. If you're looking for something gourmet, then this is not your place. If you are looking for the Mexican version of comfort food, give it a try!"
2,"Pretty good food. Pop in here for a quick lunch or a quick dinner. I wouldn't plan on coming here for a nice dinner while on vacation, but after a long day of sightseeing, if you want to just sit down and get some Mexican and a few coronas without having to go back to the hotel and shower and get dressed up, this place will do. I think it's a bit more pricey then Sam's Place next door, but check the menus on line."
0,"So this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom. Almost couldn't even sit down to go. (yuck) ok on to the rest. The chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice. The Numero 15 is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans. The only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa. It was so bland. I don't know that it was worth the $3 parking validation we came for. My friend and I love Mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere, my suggestion go elsewhere."
2,I had the fish taco platter.  It was good and had both green and purple cabbage.  The tacos came with white rice and black beans (which I love).  I found the salsa hotter than I expected.  The tea was fresh and cold.  \n\nThe only thing I would have improved is to have more flavorful fish.  It was a bit bland.  Overall an A-OK place to eat.
3,"(Let me preface this review by saying that, being from Houston, I'm accustomed to eating authentic salsa, tacos, tamales, etc. My taste for Mexican food is most likely biased to a certain method or seasoning used around here.) \n\nMy waitress was quick to take my drink order once I was seated, and was attentive and sweet. I drank a \""Blue Amigo\"", their house marg that is $2.50 all day every day. It was a bit sweet for my taste, but still okay. \n\nChips were great, but their \""salsa\"" is what I know as pico de gallo. Luckily, I love pico, so it was all good. \n\nOn to the food - I ordered the N\u00famero Tres, which is 2 beef or chicken tacos (I chose beef), rice, beans, and a cheese enchilada. First impression...this place makes a mean cheese enchilada. Like, GOOOOD. Their red gravy was probably the best I've ever had. Rice, delicious. Refried beans, amazing. Beef tacos...yuck. I can't help but think that the beef in these tacos tasted like dog food smells. It was more of a shredded beef...bland...and just had an overall odd taste. I only ate about 3/4 of a taco and called it a night. I'm used to well-seasoned ground beef tacos, and these were just bizarre, in my opinion. \n\nOverall, great place! I would visit again next time I'm in Phoenix, bull I'll probably stay away from the beef."
1,It was OK. A Mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy! Food was average at best. Service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive.
0,"We like baja Fresh, but this particular location gets 1 Star, due to their crazy unstable hours of being open!  They seem to close whenever they want! If it's not busy, they'll just close! ...esp, on the weekends!, they will close like at 2 PM!!!...I feel this is so stupid, considering that the Light Rail is literally right at their front door & people are getting off it like every 10 mins, so they are just losing money, & with all of the Theatre & Sports Events,...they are totally forgetting all of that, too.   Chipotle is just a few blocks away at Cityscape & they are open til 10 pm,,,,every single night, period!  ...Just go there instead."
4,"Honestly, I'm not sure what to expect when eating at Hooters. So far, so good, thus, the 5 stars.  But, I do have one minor issue with them, but not enough to downgrade them.\n\nEating here is what I imagined the 70's to be about.  Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences.  The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.\n\nMy only \""complaint\"" is that I have carried out a few times from this location.  A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling \""less important\"" then maybe the dine in patrons."
1,"I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?\n\nAlso, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.\n\nI don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.\n\nYour tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you."
0,"Stay away from this hooters. Bad food, bad service. Bleh!"
1,"This Hooters is near my house so it's always convienient to come here, but the service and the food is hit or miss. \nI frequent a lot and really enjoy their wings. The server was MIA all night, twice I had ordered wings one flavor-honey thai and i got the new flavor they have- chipotle honey both times. Was not satisfied at all. Server took my drink for refill and never came back after 20 minutes I asked for the check, she sure was quick to come get that. \nThe manager there is rude and unattentive, she accused my friend of \""making a coupon\"" that was on their website and did not want to accept it because she said she didn't know where the coupon came from even though we pulled up the website and showed her the coupon. \n The one that I really enjoy is the one on Alma School, it is a bit of a drive but the food and service is always spot on!"
0,"I don't know what happen to Hooters? My roommate in college use to work for one in Houston so I have frequent Hooters a time or hundred in my life. The quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty, the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced. I just want some wings once in a while with breading.  iIt is difficult to find."
1,"I go here at least once every two years whether I want too or not. It usually is not, but I go. \n\nToday was one of those days.\n\nWe arrived probably around 1:20 p.m. and the lunch rush was over; if it had one.\n\nThe young lady took the name and said it will be about ten minutes, ok no big deal. This gave me time to look around again for the first time. The building and the d\u00e9cor is tired and uninviting. It could be really nice if it tried.\n\nOk so this is not fine dining I know that, I accept this.\n\nOur server was Cory; he did a fine job with a very pleasant attitude. \n\nI ordered what was recommended to me by two folks; the Mizithra Cheese and Brown Butter. It is said to be a toothsome treat for cheese lovers. What in Gods name does that mean I have no idea? Nor do I know why a cheese lover would love this dish. I also ordered a salad and cup of soup. Clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name. I beg, please do not give me a wet salad, dry the veggies first and then serve them. As for the toothsome treat it self, well no. Bruce looked over and said; man that looks dry is it missing something? I would not know since I have never had it before, but I do know if this is a favourite dish of anyone they have very low standards in food.\n\nI like good food; I want good food even in a middle of the road place like this. Find inspiration and pass it along to your patrons. I mean if I am going to remain fat I want it to mean something....."
1,"We used to eat here often many years ago.  It was good then and they were always busy.  So, we were in the are last night and thought we'd give them a go again.  They were not busy at all for a Saturday night.  The staff were friendly enough, but a little too casual.  In my opinion this is no longer a fine dining destination but a pit stop for pasta.  The restaurant has lost its class. \nThe food was a huge let down.  It was very bland and way over priced for the portions served.  \n\nWe wont be going back"
3,"The Old Spaghetti Factory has such a fun atmosphere.  We've gone twice and both times were sat in these booths that were like little rooms.  I loved it!  \n\nIt's a really great place for kids, especially with these little booth rooms.  The food didn't really leave an impression on me, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing though, it can't all be good."
2,"I have been going off and on to this place since i was a kid!\nI went last weekend and i think more than anything i just LOVE the place it's self. The food is hit or miss and they took eggplant off the menu and i do have to say that was my favorite thing to get there. But the building is so beautiful and inside is so many eye catching things to look at. and they have a trolley inside as well, so the kids would love that.\nThe service is AMAZING, i would give them a rating of 5 stars on that part, friendly, always around and quick.\nThe prices are not bad either, your meal comes with a drink, salad or soup and dinner and dessert all included. i pretty much never get the dessert their portions are big.\nThey do have a bar as well but it is not put to good use as i see it, it is in the back of the restaurant and they have never tried to make it a place to just go hang out and have drinks, too bad because it is pretty cool area.\nThere is rumor that the building is haunted and that they do have ghosts in there, so keep your eyes and ears open!!\nIt is just a warm beautiful place to go with friends, family or a date!!"
2,"3 stars is sufficient..... I feel the prices are on the high side...Yes, I know it  comes with a small salad, bread, a drink (iced tea or milk is included, but not soda....go figure), & a small cup of ice cream, but it still seems a little pricey to me. \nI felt like the portions are all not that big.  I love the Mizithra Cheese...So yummy! But there were a few times where I felt like they didn't really give you enough on the spaghetti.... I felt a little gipped.  \nIf you really want Italian Food, then go to Oregano's instead!...NOW we're talkin'!"
3,"I come here about 4 or 5 times a year. It's consistently good. There is ample seating, so I've never waited long. It's off Central, so the parking is horrid. Their lot holds a good number, but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded - I don't drive my van here.\n  I am always pleased with the food. I find the salads ok - I really like their Balsalmic Vinigarette dressing - I'll mop the leftover with bread.\n I typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. The sauce has a good flavor.\n The Brown Butter with Mizithra Cheese is incredible - but very rich.\n  The staff is always courteous, and I rarely have to wait for anything."
0,"omg. sitting in the bar because they had no seating in main diningroom.  menus flung onto the table, no greeting from server. when i mentioned it to the server. she gets an attitude. food comes out, cold and unappetizing.... having to listen to a guy at the next table scream, use the f bomb every other sentence.\nmanager did bring our hot food out personally so we got to talk. this is not the place i remember to come and dine and enjoy........"
2,They seem to be declining over recent years but the Mizithra is so good we went back anyway.  Appetizer flatbread was fair.  Chicken parm was fair.  Mizithra was great.
1,"I want Tom's to be better... but it isn't.  The place has a cool \""Cheers\"" vibe, the service is excellent, but...\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese.  The simplest thing on the menu, right?  WRONG!  \n\nThose of you who are grilled cheese experts, like I am** will understand when I say: there was no butter on the bread and there was only one paltry slice of american cheese.  Seriously.  At least give me some cheese for my grilled cheese sandwich.  It's even in the title!\n\nI am sure that Tom's has more options for non-carnivores on their huge menu, but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to peruse the menu at length or concoct a special order.\n\nThe worst part?  My sub-par grilled cheese, fries, and iced tea came to $12!!!  Come on!  They put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast!\n\nAt least the service was good.\n\n**side note: I really wish more restaurants would get on the options for vegetarians bandwagon.  No, I do not want iceberg lettuce on a plate with italian dressing, thank you."
2,"We came here for a networking event last week. The crowd (or crowding, as it were) was akin to that of a happy hour or pregame crowd. We felt squished. \n\nThe tap selection is basic, although having the Sam Adams seasonal always makes me like a place. We got to smaple some small bites of some new apps theyre working on which were good. Braised beef pappadeaux. Thats all Im saying.\n\nI may come here again, but only if its not super crowded."
1,"Decent burger, good salads but really high prices for the quality...probably because of the location.  Nice outdoor seating area."
3,"We'veeaten here on a previous trip to Phoenix, but this time we just popped in a couple of times for beers..staff are friendly, service good,  and there is a wide range of local and imported draft beer. Good place to have a rest from walking around and cool down.  Food looks good, and last time we eat here it was pretty tasty. Gets busy around then end of the working day with office workers, but nice bar."
3,"I found this place by accident. Blink and you'll miss it. Best fried catfish I've had. Totally not greasy. Thin cornmeal batter is the right amount of crispy. Fish is tender and moist inside without being greasy at all. Coleslaw was pretty decent. Cornbread was soft and had a hint of sweetness but not too much. Portions are good. Vegetarian options for the non-meat eater. I ate well for less than $10, tip included. Glad I found it."
3,"Was in conference at the Phoenix Convention Center and a glorious smell wafted through from the east. Turning to my left I saw a plate, and lady tearing something up..fiercely . Me and three other people immediately stopped what we were doing and walked somewhat zombie like to where the food was and asked...where did you get that? Karim's Cobbler Shop and Deli was her reply...in between bites.  \n\nNow I've been in Phoenix for 3 months looking for a taste of soul food. And here it was in my back yard! I was shocked!!!\n\nWith a sense of urgency I walked the streets until once again I was seduced by the smell of fried fish. Wasnt very far, and it was perched right in front of the Light Rail.  My kind of place.\n\nFirst thought, very humble. Very clean and neat and humble.  The owner was very kind, friendly and humble. Very confident that whatever I ordered I would love it. And I did.\n\nAs the only customer in the place I had soo many questions..How long were you here. Where do you market you store, cuz I never heard of it. With a smile he explained that his customers usually come in thru word of mouth and via the smell.\n\nI ordered the 3 piece whiting (its a east coast thing) It was well seasoned yet  non-greasy and well I wanted more of it. A side of red rice and beans which was flavorful and simply not enough.  Not usually a peach cobbler fan but it had so many intricate flavors. I sensed some clove, cinnamon, brown sugar...and something I can't quite put my finger on. The detective will be back to figure out this mystery.  It was sooo GOOOD!\n\n\nHearing so many complaints that Phoenix has alot of sun but no soul I can confidently say that there is however scatter amongst the desert.  One just have to put in the detective work. Use the senses...it will lead you there. But if you can't follow my lead.  Karim's Cobbler shop is the place to get your grub on.  Bring your families and friends too.  Everyone will leave happy. Or with an extra side :)"
4,"This is the only spot I trust to get my ride a bath, even though I drive a beater, the staff here treat it as if its an expensive European car. \n\nAttention to detail not only comes from the car wash staff but also from Gene who meticulously maintains the gloss and shine of all my Italian kicks."
0,"My very first review - my dark blue car ruined on the exterior.  Couldn't see it until I returned home and the sunlight revealed exterior body scratches.  Evidently they didn't take care to use clean rags/towels.  Looks like a Brillo pad was used.  Going back tomorrow to see if we can get this rectified.\n\nWell, I'll keep my review the same.  Took my car in this morning to see what could be done.  A \""charming\"" older woman (JOVEL) came out to tell me this was definitely not caused by them an it was without a doubt caused by a buffer.  I explained to her that a buffer had not touched my car since it was last detailed by European Detail over six months ago.  To my face she told me I was not providing the truth and if I took it to a BMW dealership they would also confirm I was \""lying\"".\n\nGuess what!!  BMW confirmed that the damage was likely caused by rags because of the linear motion that was apparent.  Rick was the gentleman from Los Olivos who accompanied me.  When he also learned that perhaps I wasn't lying as JOVEL had certainly alleged he offered a re-wash and a had wax to correct the problem.  Thank you Rick for obeing a professional.  \n\nEven upon return to the Wash JOVEL was still had her heals dug in refusing to acknowledge any error on their part. \n\nAlthough the business has taken a turn to rectify it was like pulling teeth or pleading a case before the the Supreme Court.  Not acceptable.  \n\nAgain kudos to Rick as a gentleman and professional.  If this was his site alone I could raise my review substantially."
2,They also messed with my side mirror and gave me a huge blind spot which I didn't notice until driving!
2,"Steer clear if you care about your body, enter if you are looking for a tasty way to shave precious years of your life.  What they have done is basically take a simple New York style Deli concept and made it appealing to the local Phoenix crowd.  The thing is, when I was living in NYC, I could afford to eat meals like this because without a car I walked an average of 3-5 miles per day.  There is simply no excuse for this type of excess in a driving city like Phoenix.  You'll spend 2 hours at the gym to burn off lunch here.  My prediction is that 50 years from now, when all the patrons of this place have died of heart attacks, the next generation will look back on this food the same way we look back on asbestos: it seemed like a good idea at the time, but boy was it a killer."
0,"I really want to like Zoe's Kitchen. I do. I really, really do. \n\nI have been to Zoe's more than 5 but less than 10 times, and yesterday was my last visit, unless I want to stop in for some limeade and chocolate cake. \n\nI have tried MANY things at Zoes, and I try to listen to what others like .... I don't like their bread at all, so every sandwich I've had has been bad. The quesadilla is OK, but I'm not a big fan of flour tortillas. The chicken roll ups (I think that's what it's called) that I had yesterday (after a good friend's recommendation) were kind of soggy and yuck-o. I don't like the pasta salad .... or the potato salad ... or their slaw .... or cold rice .... \n\nDo you see my challenge here? The decor is adorable, and I really want to love the place, but I think I've paid my very last visit to Zoes. \n\nSo, so sad!"
1,"I wish there were stars for service and food separately because I hate to give 2 stars to a place I like, but the service today was just...ugh.\n\nFirst off, I like Zoe's. It's not the greatest food ever but they use a lot of feta and I love feta. I am not a fan of the overdesigned feel of the restaurant, but whatever.\n\nToday, I departed from my normal and had a different sandwich. I asked the girl at the register nicely if it could not be too heavily toasted because I've had some turkey sandwiches nearly blackened to where the bread was useless. She not only proceeded to do a subtle half-eye roll, but she was outright unpleasant. I've never seen her there before and this surprised me because usually the people up front are really nice. \n\nWill I go back? Yes. But I'll make sure to not go to her if there is someone else available or just order it on the phone so that way if she does answer, I can't see her roll her eyes at me. \n\nOh, and they didn't burn my sandwich alright. Actually (if I could take a picture I would) they barely heated it. The cheese is still mostly intact."
1,"it is very nice to have a healthier alternative during lunch. That being said, the food really isn't that great and is WAY OVERPRICED. My small pita sandwich (comes with a side), and drink was over $10 bucks. You can go to Paradise or Subway for a whole lot less. Not only that, but there is never any parking available, and most of the menu items are completely bland. Drop the prices and add some flavor to the food."
0,"The reason I Yelp is for entertainment and because I use the reviews from others to choose where I spend my money, so I like doing my part by sharing my own experiences. My intention is not to get free stuff. Ever. I rarely write negative reviews, and the reason I wrote a negative review for Zoe's was because I believe the conditions of the restaurant were a health risk. That being said, here is my update. So one of the managers from Zoe's asks for my phone number so he can find out more information. I give it to him, willing to share my experience. He calls me, hears me out, and apologizes. Then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate. Unnecessary, I tell him, but nice touch. So I give him my address. Now, 2 weeks later, nothing. I messaged the customer service person who had contacted me initially just to let her know the gift card had not arrived. Just pretty surprising the level of poor management. I am no longer wondering what happen to Zoe's because it is pretty self evident."
2,"Good food, quick service. Kinda pricey for the brown bag crowd. Great tea!"
2,"I had no clue I've the sophistication of an earthworm when it comes to food until I read other Zoes Kitchen reviews.  For our information, looking at the Zoe's Kitchen web page, I found out they are a national chain.  Call-in/Take-out and catering are  big parts of the business model.   The fine points of excellence are up to the franchisee.  \n\nIt looks like people having the worst experiences come in for lunch.  We tried Zoes for an evening meal.  Nicely styled with an attractive glass wall on the north facing McDowell Street.  Outdoor dining.  \n\nWe got a chicken kabob and a hummus and salad plate.  Both came with a haystack of mixed green salad with onion, Greek olives and feta.  That's fine with me.  The health survey my insurance company bribed me to fill out determined I don't eat enough greens and fruits.  Score one for Zoe's there. Each table had a bottle of Greek dressing so salads are seasoned to taste.  Mine also came with a tiny tub of Tzatziki.\n\nThe chicken kabob was good.  Chicken, green pepper, onion, cherry tomato.  I found out I like cherry tomatoes much more when they're grilled.  Apparently my family has a gene for fresh tomato aversion.  The grilled cherry T's were very good, the chicken not overcooked, and the rest of the veggies very good.  \n\nThe amount of hummus, about 3/4 cup, was decent, the pita was served as small wedges.  The taste was hummus and pita.  Not Great, not Terrible.  \n\nOur beverages were endless ice tea.  \n\nThe bit of the meal that was unprofessional in the food service industry was a salad core in Sweet D's greens pile.  The price of our meal was $21.00.   I'm thinking the goal of this Mediterranean fast food franchise is a meal for $10.  We'll go back.  After we try more of the eateries at 7th Ave and McDowell."
2,"Went here for dinner last night for the first time. The desserts and packaged foods looked DELICIOUS. \n\nI am picky about meat (like I don't like biting into tendons and things I don't want to eat) so the chicken kabobs were a little iffy (I bit into things I didn't want to eat), but they were seasoned well. \n\nThe rest of the food was very fresh. The greek salad that I got as a side was great!! A ton of feta cheese on mine, really clean lettuce. The side of rice was great, too. \n\nI am gluten-free, so I had to pass on the pita bread, but that looked really good, too. \n\nThe food was a little simple for my taste, but not bad. I'm not sure if I would go back, just because of my food preferences, but others may love it. \n\nThey serve you on disposable plates and cups with plastic silverware, so it's a very simple restaurant. \n\nAnother person in my party got a chicken pita, but it looked like it was only a half pita stuffed with chicken. I personally would have wanted two halves, but I guess I eat a lot...\n\nWorth a try once if you like fresh food, pitas, veggies and kabobs. It's a good place to stop in to try something quick and new.\n\nOverall, good, but I prefer the restaurants around the area though- there is a Habit Burger, Five Guys, etc that I would prefer."
4,"You know what's great? Walking into a banking establishment and having the tellers know your name! I've been with Sunwest for 27 years, and I've never had any fees charged to me (yay automatic and free overdraft protection!) Your mileage may vary, but I love these guys. This branch is fantastic. All the employees are friendly and knowledgeable."
1,"This Subway is in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten at this particular restaurant several times and it was just regular old Subway.  There are so many better choices near by for sandwiches,  I can't seem to understand how this place can be so busy.  Subway claims to want to offer better health choices for customers, yet they regularly offer \""footlong\"" subs that are marginally more expensive than a 6-inch sandwich.\n\nIf you are looking for a decent sandwich in the area, head over to Crave (my favorite) or corner bakery."
0,"We were guests there once in about 2003 for one of the morning services.  We are used to megachurches with lots of praise and worship and messages where many Bible passages are referred to and explained with practical, applicable and content-rich teaching and even some humor.  We are used to churches that are ALIVE.  I felt like I was at someone's funeral.  I didn't feel the Holy Spirit there at all.  In fact, I felt really strange like I couldn't wait to leave not only the church but the grounds.  The greeters smiled a lot; I'm sure some of them weren't fake."
2,"I'm not normally a patron of chain restaurants, but I went to Hard Rock Cafe downtown last week to see a local band, Super Stereo, perform there.  And actually, up until I bought the tickets for the show, I didn't even know Hard Rock allowed local bands to perform there.  That's pretty cool of them, and I respect that.\n\nThe beer selection was mediocre at best, the mushroom and swiss burger was tasty, and the server was kind and attentive.  I couldn't ask much more from Hard Rock so I won't.  If you're downtown and need a bite to eat, there are several better joints to check out.  However, if you have a specific reason to go to Hard Rock (like I did), go there and enjoy yourself.  You'll have a good time.\n\nOh, and Super Stereo kicked butt!  Check them out!!"
0,"I went to Hard Rock Cafe for the first time with a coupon for a $4 meal. (Legenary burger, fries, and soft drink) The only positive is that the food was alright. It was good for the $4 I paid, but not the $15+tax and tip it was normally.\n\nThe cons:\n- The customer service was laughable. Our waiter come up to my guest and I, who both had empty drinks at the time, and said \""Good? Good?\"" with thumbs up. My guest asked for a refill and specified that I needed one, too. Later in the meal when both of our drinks were totally empty again, I asked for a refill. He only brought one for me, so my guest and I shared my drink. He clearly couldn't care less. \n- The burger was dry, like it was previously frozen. It definitely didn't taste fresh.\n- The veggies on the side to put on the burger weren't crisp. I usually like lettuce on my burger, but not their wilted lettuce.\n- The fries weren't seasoned and they weren't anything special. I'd compare them to Wendy's fries. \n- The music videos they play are awful. For being the Hard Rock Cafe you'd think that they'd play some well known rock stuff. ...nope... my guest and I were there for almost two hours and there was only one song we recognized. While I'm not a music expert, my guest is. To top it off, their bad music is so loud that you have to yell to talk to someone across the table. I expected loud music at the Hard Rock Cafe, but not bad loud music."
2,"When I worked at the Renaissance tower, I'd come here when I was too lazy to walk down the street for something better. Because, honestly, their pizza just isn't that great. Or good, really. But I've had the breakfast muffin twice and both times it was beyond awesome! Just the right amount of grease to let you know it's good. And super cheap!"
0,"It was a terrible experience in every possible way. The wait time in the drive thru lane was excessive, the order was incorrect, and the chicken was slimy and smelled like it was rotting. I haven't eaten McDonald in over a year before trying it again and I found it to be just as disgusting as the last time."
3,"I visited the convention center as part of the expo for the Rock N Roll marathon/half marathon and this review sprawls across both of these entities.\n\nAs for the convention center, it's certainly in the upper half of \""Convention Centers I have known\"". The rooms are spacious and it's easy to get up and down floors. The design is nice with easy access to the stairs and escalators and they have the exit-only designs that are conveniently located. It may not be the greatest endorsement when I say that the convention center can be quickly exited, but I appreciated these benefits.\n\nThe Rock N Roll expo was also reasonable: they have a similar set up at all their races and the number and scope of vendors is impressive. Now, I've always considered these things the equivalent of runners' porn and typically try to get out as quickly as possible. It only takes a momentary distraction to have you stop in front of a stall and decide that you must have the new Saucony socks (\""But these are ULTRA wicking!\"")\n\nI've taken the Jason Bourne in an embassy in Switzerland approach: when you walk in the entrance, you put your earpiece in, rip the diagram of the building off the wall, analyze the quickest route between the points you need to go and then march. This typically works fairly well and you can navigate through the whole affair in a few minutes. Not too shabby.\n\nA friend of mine has a different philosophy. He claims that you want to take the more circuitous route through the hall since people tend to congregate in the center of the place. He probably has a point (although I'll never admit that to him): there's actually a hierarchy of vendors and the less desirable ones tend to get stuck along the back walls. When you navigate this path, the crowds are sparser and the vendors are listlessly standing next to stalls of \""Used Running Socks\"" and \""Backwash Gatorade\"". I tried this manuever at the Phoenix expo and found that I could exit the building a little faster. An idea to try the next time you're at one of these things......"
2,"For a convention center, Phoenix Convention Center is pretty decent. The space is large, the amenities are clean and they have several food options at the cafeteria and now just catered options. They actually have restaurants who serve food. \n\nHowever, this is the reason the Phoenix Convention Center gets three not four stars. The parking for the convention center is $12. Normally, people already pay to get into the event and I think that if you pay to attend an event at the Phoenix Convention Center, parking is included. I'm not sure if other conventions center do it this way, but it'd be nice if they did!"
1,"This place would just be OK if they didn't insult you by charging you to park just to try to give them some business.  It's pretty dead, with lots of empty shops.  You'd think they'd want to encourage more visitors.  There are a couple of decent restaurants in the place, but nothing fantastic.  Otherwise it's mostly overpriced trinket shops."
2,The landscaping and maintenance are well done.  I walk down here at lunch to detox and revitalize myself for the afternoon.  I don't see a whole lot of stores that would draw me in on a regular basis though.  I am hopeful this place will see a Renaissance and draw in more interesting shops ala The Union at the Biltmore.
4,"On vacation and this place was across the street. The guy who helped me was very nice. He carried on conversation and reccommeded places I should try in the area while visiting. I wish I knew his name to put on here. He spoke english and lived in North Carolina at one time. Anway, prices were good and service"
3,"I come here for lunch often. They have good lunch prices on sushi and rice/noodle bowls. The staff is always friendly. You can eat in or carry out. I usually get the lunch spicy tuna roll. It is delicious and cheap! Their miso soup is pretty good. I've never tried the bowls because I know I would go into a food coma after lunch, but they always look delicious. Some of their regular sushi rolls are a little pricey, but other than that, no complaints. A great lunch spot!"
2,"Big  Thank you to Honey Bears to start off, why you ask ? Because they were open ! Wish I could give a 1/2 star extra for that.  Listen Downtown!  you   want me  to bring my family and friends down on the weekend,you want us to explore downtown and use the metro rail,   we need some family friendly , hopefully locally owned,  places to eat !  So 1 big ole star for that!  Now for the rest ...Honey Bears has that  hole in the wall , down south feel to me , and that alone will probably bring me back at sometime .  Especially if I have kids with me otherwise it's Switch, Matt's or Fez. \n\nOkay and now for the hits:\n\nThis is a  good  place for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwich ...don't stray from that and you will be happy , husband and kiddos gave a big two thumbs up for that... lil mini me had a 1/2 chicken dinner  w/o \nBBQ sauce ( weirdo)  and pronounced it good.  Mine were  ribs which were very small, not meaty and I had trouble with tang of the vinegar based sauce.(BTW hubby loved it ) Portions were big on everything but my ribs.  Faux Daughter number 2 couldn't finish her sandwich. \n\nI could eat a big ole plate of the mac and cheese wow cheesey goodness... kids agreed.\nFries were rumored to be good , one of my kids said  better than\n in -n-out the others shot her a dirty look .. so you try them and see. \nLoved the coleslaw and I wouldn't  share it with anyone .Corn was good but not memorable. \n\nThey have RC and Seven up products which goes to show it's old school I guess. If you can't abide by that bring your own I guess. \n\nService was great, the dude taking our order was personable, helpful and patient with our big order. They also redid mini me's order when it first came with BBQ sauce. \n\nPlace is nicer than Stacey's for ambiance but I don't really look for that with BBQ , do you?"
2,"This is really one of the more disappointing BBQ places in Phx.  I hate to disrespect Honey Bears but their pulled pork is just too dry.  I shouldn't have to cover it in your bbq sauce (which isn't THAT good either) in order to make it edible.  Also, if you are going to churn out dry pork, you have got a lot of nerve charging for more bbq sauce.  I've never had anything else here but the fact that the pork isn't all that good is all I need to know.  I'll stick with Stacey's down the road."
3,"It may look like a fast food joint on the outside but this place is local Arizona BBQ at it's tastiest. \n\nI ordered the 1/2 lb. pork rib dinner ($11.49) which came with two sides. They ran out of collard greens so I settled for two corn cobs.\n\nWith the ribs and corn my face and fingers are super messy from the sauce. Good thing I'm eating alone. The ribs were super delicious! I wanted to cover every bite in their BBQ sauce. It was that good. The sauce was slightly tangy with just the right amount of sweetness. Honey Bear's calls it Tennessee BBQ, but here in Phoenix it's oh so good."
3,love this place!!! the wait is long and the cashier is slow!!! there is one worker which i think is the owners son he has long hair he is awesome! he helped us get our food faster! but the other cashier was so slow!!! but besides the wait it is an amazing place the pork BBQ sandwich was Delicious and so was the coleslaw.
3,"This place has really delicious BBQ. I would have given it a 5 if the chicken wasn't a little dry and the interior of the facility was a little neater and cleaner. I'm not saying it was dirty, it's just the trashy sign on the fountain drink saying not to put stuff in the drain. I also didn't like the \""real\"" trash can being turned around so there's no access to the door and a large \""kitchen\"" grey trash can sitting right beside it. All in all a good visit, but not a 5."
1,"WATCH OUT FOR THE TIP AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED BY THE SERVER IF YOU ARE THERE FOR THE GROUP GATHERING!\n\nI have been to this place twice (Happy Hour and Dinner) and the food and wine are generally decent. I can't complain much about the ambient, cheese, food, and wine, but when it comes to the time to pay, some server charges excessive amount of service tip on your bill. You need to watch out for this and need to sober up!\n\nOne of the servers told me that the tip amount for the group gathering (6 people or more) is 18% out of the total before Tax, but when I received the bill the gratuity was 23% AFTER THE TAX amount. (I realized this when I saw the bill next day). So I over paid the tip although I thought the service was OK. (I asked for a glass of ice water several times, but the server was keep forgetting my requests).\n\nAgain, if you are planning some group event here, please watch out for the tip unless you believe the service is superb...."
2,"I think I really like this place. Ayesha and I had a chance to visit  Cheuvront on a Monday night. It wasn't terribly busy when we arrived and we were warmly greeted. Unfortunately we were seated next to a loud group of young children that thought they knew something of the world and were very LOUDLY passionate about their arguments. The F bombs were being dropped so incessantly that it became annoying. Our server and the manager that was walking around said nothing to this group. Finally when I could no longer hear what Ayesha was saying, I got up and told the Junior Aristocrats to shut the hell up. The manager and the waiter came over to apologize for the patrons' behavior. I wish they would have done the scolding, not me, oh well.  I could finally enjoy my meal. I got the Marguerite which was cut into strips rather than triangles. The pizza sauce was flavorful, and the cheese was real mozzarella, not that processed stuff that you would find on cheaper pizza. The wine that I picked was really good, though I can't remember what I drank (sorry gang). I really liked the decor and the 007 movies playing in the background. I look forward to visiting Cheuvront's again to try their other dishes and maybe not have to set some people straight on using their \""inside voices\""."
4,"I've been to Cheuvronts over the years for lunch and afternoon wine and cheese pairings, and always had a good time.\n\nBut the real sleeper deal and meal is their weekend breakfast menu. I've been three times now, had their version of Eggs Benedict the first two and today, a wonderful Filet Medallion with 2 eggs, potatoes and fruit cup...with blueberry muffin. The Eggs Benedict is $9.50, today's meal was $12.00. All fresh and wonderful and the best part, no wait. You can dine on the patio or inside. When I think that folks are waiting at First Watch and Matt's Big Breakfast, while I just sail over to a table,  I pity those fools. \n\nIt's not the cheapest breakfast in the Valley, but for the price it's certainly one of the best."
2,"Although the food, wine, and atmosphere are all good, sadly I must say I have been let down. One of my problems is the sometimes slow service. Also we decided to go here for a friends birthday and they ran out of food. It was not fun feeling like you had the angel of death for a server ready to kill your order. I really would love to give the place four stars, because the food and wine are certainly worth it, but due to my traumatic experience its just a-ok. Maybe I will get a chance to go back and update my review to what I know it really could be."
3,"One of the few places in the up and coming Warehouse District of SoJack you will find Alice Cooper's Town, a beautiful blend of sports and music. Kind of like ESPN Cafe meets Hard Rock Cafe, you've got a great combination that offers quality American bar-style food with an energetic atmosphere.\n\nThe waiters are all done up in their best face paint and the walls are full of memorabilia creating one of the most unique places in the city. You will find a two-story warehouse that has been converted into a bar with restaurant along with an adjoining patio.\n\nThe food, blessed with possibly the best naming scheme I have encountered is top notch too! Some of my personal favorite named food on the menu:\n\n\""The Big Unit\"" Hot Dog, Ryne Sandburger, Amazing \""Grace\"" Burger, and my personal favorite on the menu - Tommy's Cali Burger.\n\nThere is a low carb menu as well as a drinks and dessert.\n\nThis is the kind of place where people come to eat before games (there is a south entrance to the arena, if you didn't know, just steps away) and to drink (or sober up) after them. It has a family friendly environment that will make anyone in the family happy to attend."
2,"This is a really fun place to grab some cocktails or beers before an event or game. My friends and I have a tradition of drinking here before DBACKS games and we always love it. Drinks are reasonable, especially if you ask the specials, and way cheaper than beers at BOB. \n\nAs for food they have an awesome menu, but the food came off a bit cheap in quality to me so I don't think it's worth ten dollars a plate. But if your hungry it will get the job done! Although...one of the days I want to try and eat one of those One Pound hot dogs they have. It is a personal goal. \n\nI recommend:\nFox Sports Marg\nBeers\nGrape Bombers"
3,"Pretty good.  Typical sports bar food. Calimari was ok, chili was pretty good, fries were awesome, and the burger wasn't bad.\nMy friend had the bases loaded big unit (as seen on man vs food). It is an insanely huge hotdog with all the toppings. Could feed 3-4 people.\nExpect to pay $15 or so per person."
4,"Awesome staff, great food and cool decor"
2,"Tonight I made my first venture to Alice Cooperstown.  Why not?  I arrived at the ballpark early and wanted to fill my stomach.  I dig Alice and heard he ran a cool place.\n\nThe decor was pretty cool.  I've never been to Hard Rock Cafe but I'm guessing it's similar in style.  But who goes to a restaurant for the decor?  Atmosphere adds to the experience but the food is what matters the most.\n\nI thought about trying the Big Unit dog but opted for the Gonzo's BBQ Beef sandwich w/ fries and Nightmare chili and I added the hot link for $2 more.\n\nThe beef brisket was just okay.  I have much better and even for a few dollars cheaper elsewhere.  To be honest, though, I don't come to a place like this expecting the best of the best.  The hot link was standard.  The Nightmare chili really stood out.  Very tasty.  My beverage was served in a giant glass and the waitress kept the refills coming which is a major plus in my book.\n\nOverall the food was decent.  I wouldn't make a special trip down to this joint but I'd eat there again if I was already in the area for a ball game."
1,I really dint care for this place. the music was blah and the out door seating was lame.The only cool thing i saw was the big unit. A home wrecking size weenie some old man was trying to deep throat.
3,"This place is a lot of fun as a result of the atmosphere and pleasant wait staff!  The menu rocks a combination of vegetarian items, low carb items, and greasy guilty pleasures.\n\nThe only problem is that it may be difficult to locate parking during peak hours, especially when a sporting event is taking place.\n\nDoes anyone know how frequently Mr. Cooper makes appearances in his restaurant?  I'm just curious..."
3,Check out my blog review and photos:\n\nhttp://food-tales-and-other-fun.tumblr.com/post/24344649924/
1,"The food was really unimpressive, especially for the prices. The Michael Bible cocktail was pretty good."
0,"Usually very pleased with Tee Pee, especially before a DBacks game. But tonight two really disappointing things happened. First, we arrived about 40 min before the game and the main wave of people were already gone. We were alone in the dining room and I mean alone - as in no waitresses for 5 minutes. Beer glasses were warm (they'd just been washed! We were told) and only 2 small bowls of chips for 6 people. Most disappointing, though, was that my grandfather forgot his jacket in the booth when we left for the game. I called 20 min later from inside the ballpark and was told it couldn't be found. After the game my mom scoured the place and it was still MIA. Very sad to think it was taken."
1,"I was in town on the night the Lakers were also in town. BF and I and a friend decided to try to get tix from a scalper. Not knowing the venue, well it figures we got jipped. We got tickets to something they call the verve lounge. Its like a club in between the lower and upper levels. OK thats fine except there is nowhere to sit and the view is lame.\nNOT worth it, I would rather sit in the nosebleeds, then again I'd rather be at Staples Center."
4,"Super clean venue! Always remember to go early to get your food before the start of the game, a few minutes before the half and possibly towards the end! \n\nThe wife and I grabbed some custom jerseys as we! I'm pretty sure we've adopted the suns as our new nba team"
2,"It's nice having a Friday's fairly close to my house in downtown.  Unfortunately, this one does not provide me with the same quality of service and value for food as the other ones do.  I appreciate the change of decor here, as this Friday's is definitely geared around the Dbacks and not the usual kitschy crap.  The food here is just as good/average as at the other locations, but I feel a little ripped off coming here.  It's always more expensive, but I guess I can understand given the neat view.  I've never been on a gameday, but I can't imagine how awful that could be.  Service is terrible here, even when nothing is going on.  Factor in the chaotics that a game most certainly brings and you set yourself up for disaster.  This is not going to be a quick or cheap meal.  If you are looking for an interesting place to kind of hang out in downtown when there isn't a game going on, Friday's Front Row is a pretty good choice, plus it's right off a lightrail stop."
2,"This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival."
0,"Do not use their ATM\n\nAttempted to withdraw $ for a bike cab when in Phoenix using my bank's card. Their ATM proceeded to charge me the withdraw amount plus $3 but game me no money. When calling the branch to ask for ATM reconciliation, nobody picks up the phone. If anybody has been to downtown Phoenix during the day, they would know only people at conferences are walking around that section of town so I couldn't imagine who they would be helping. After getting routed to their 800 line several times and being told to only the branch or my bank could start that process I decided to give them the ol \""call repeatedly until someone picks up.\"" After about 30+ tries, I reached a girl who told me only the phone support number could start this process. Explained to her that several agents had told me the branch had to start this process and ask to be introduced during a transfer to someone who could help. Guess what? I was just sent to the start of the 800 menu again. Was not able to reach anybody after another 10 calls, I gave up defeated but still victorious. Victorious in the fact I don't have a bank account with these unresponsive a holes. Would never consider opening an account with any BofA after my experience with this branch and will be sure tell others to heed my warning.  Thank FSM for local banks!!"
4,"Cheap and fast -express !! - delicious hummus and taromasalata , the burgers weren't bad ,  a convenient location for where I was working - myself and colleagues had around fifteen meals here in the space of a week , - nothing wrong with any of them."
3,"The AZ Science center is great for kids which is why Adult's Night Out is twice as good!\n\nI checked out the science center at last nights first Friday of the month \""adults only night\"".  Not only was admission free but they validated out parking making it free as well.  We were able to check out all of the exhibits with little or no wait and with adults only it was much less hectic than on a regular day."
1,"Bus load, after bus load, after bus load of kids with few adults to manage them.  Holy cow, what a disaster.  Throwing balls, running kids, and no adults from the schools nor enough science museum staff to manage it all.  This was quite an annoying experience, and hard to enjoy the exhibits.  They really need to get this under control."
2,"Well first of all the $14 dollar admission fee is ridiculous...but what's more ridiculous is the $14 admission fee plus $3 dollars extra if you want to go in a maze.....\n\nWell since it's my bf's bday and there really isn't much to do in AZ, I decided what the heck and went for the $17 fee...just to kill time before dinner at POSH. So it has 4 levels....the first level was about building houses, and the human body...i admit some of the interactive displays were kinda cool but some where kinda boring. the second level consist of science on electricity, weigh, magnets, and light. The only thing i thought was cool was the nail bed. The third level was where the maze was and also where you learn about clouds, grand canyon and environmental sciences. The maze was a rip off really...don't understand why they charged $3 for the entrance...it was filled with optical illusion posters that I've already seen before online....so yeah really not worth the extra $3 bucks. -_-\""\n\nwe didn't get to see the 4th level unfortunately because we needed to leave before our two hour meter runs out...oh yeah parking is like $12 bucks in the garage....so yeah just park on the street if you can. \n\nSo $17 dollars i killed an hour and half at most. This place is really meant for kids....children....under 12...because I even think any kid above 12 would find this place a little boring. I can't believe they even have a membership program...who would want to come here more than once?"
4,"My husband and I attended the yelp sponsored date night at the Arizona Science Center. We had a blast checking out all the hands-on exhibits as well as the planetarium. The Van Gogh Alive! was an excellent immersive multimedia mix of art, music, and quotes."
2,"When the weather gets hot in Phoenix, this is one of the places where Phoenix residents come to cool off.   The family and I visited the museum on hot summer Saturday in the middle of July.  The line was long to get in the science center and not enough people working there to sell tickets to get us inside.  After a 30 minute wait, we finally got in.  \n\nChildren can play in the water and get each other wet at Waterworks.   Or, they can work with pipes to see how water flows.  The daughter was able to learn different things about the body.  She was able to listen to her heartbeat to the beat of drum.  She was also able to throw round balls into a nose to cause it sneeze and expel the balls back at you.  My wife did not allow the child to ride the Skycycle.  She thought it was too dangerous, not to mention the extra fee involved to ride it.  Tornado Alley was interesting with the fans that blow the wind at you, and the sprinklers that rain on you.  \n\nIt seems like some of these exhibits travel from museum to museum.  Both the Sesame Street Body exhibit and the Skycycle exhibits have recently been in Southern California.  I didn't have to come all the way to Phoenix to see these exhibits.  \n\nOverall, I thought the museum was okay.   There were some things that were different from other science museums.   But, not enough to warrant the $15 for adults and $11 for children, not even for the air conditioning inside."
3,"I recently attended the October Adults Night Out. The premise of the program is great-free admission, adult beverages, etc. I enjoyed exploring the museum and it was a nice activity for a Friday Night. The only downfall(s) were 1. The line to check in was extremely long. It didn't move slow, but it wasn't fast either. I had registered online but forgot to print the tickets. I would suggest definitely printing tickets ahead of time. The second issue was the \""beer garden.\"" While I enjoyed the premise and the beers, there were only 2 beer servers and 1 wine server for many many people. The line went painfully slow and it made it hard to use the drink tickets and visit the center. Many people were actually giving away their tickets because the line was too long. I would attend another ANO again but I hope that they make some changes in the future to the above mentioned things."
0,This place has gone down hill. What used to be in the normal exhibits are now in a paid exhibit hall. It's sad that they have resorted to that to make money. I won't be renewing my membership.
1,"I'm sorry, but I have to say I am not impressed with the AZ Science Center. I bought a family membership, which was pretty expensive, we visited a couple of times, and that was plenty. The exhibits are always the same and kind of boring, except for whatever traveling exhibit they may have, and that costs extra on top of your membership! And I was not at all impressed with the Ripley's exhibit. I can honestly say Ripley's was a rip. Last time we were there, some of the cooler things were broken (like the little bike that goes around in a circle).\n\nOverall, it's probably fine for a one-time visit, but I wouldn't waste money on a membership. It gets old fast."
3,"Ahh, the Arizona Science Center.\n\nThe MUSEUM:\nI have been here countless times since I was in elementary school, and I have to say... it was better back in the day. Not out of nostalgia or anything, although I'm sure that's part of it... But some of the cooler exhibits they used to have have been replaced with slightly less cool ones. \n\nStill, it is a nice, cool place to go on a date, especially for two nerds like us. If you are adults looking to go there, well, just don't go during the summer. The sheer number of kids will drive you nuts. Best time to go for people avoiding kids is on a weekday in the morning and during lunch, because most people are eating at the cafeteria during that time so you can have the exhibits mostly to yourself. Let loose, have fun, try out all the exhibits and feel like a kid again.\n\nThat being said, it IS a great place for kids, I remember spending hours here with my parents and school friends back in the day. You have so much fun, you don't even realize you're learning. That is the best way to learn! Everything is hands-on and if you're lucky, you might even get to be an assistant for one of the demonstrations. They don't know how cool it was back in the day, so they will LOVE it. Especially nerd juniors and whiz kids-- I know because I was one. Ha!\n\nThe FOOD:\nWell, it was better back in the day. It (the restaurant AND the menu) has gone under a major renovation since then. It has always been a bit pricey, so if you don't want to whip out your wallet for a small, greasy individual pizza and fries for twelve bucks, I recommend bringing your own lunches instead. The food is okay, if you really want to eat there for the novelty, but really nothing to write home about.\n\nThe SOUVENIR SHOP:\nYou guessed it-- it was better back in the day. It's true! There were a lot more cool science kits and tons more toys and candy to choose from, but it is still worth a visit. There are plenty of glow-in-the-dark decorations and some nifty little gift items.\n***In particular, if you love sour candy, I recommend the vials of liquid sour candy, Formula Sour--my husband is a sour candy connoisseur and this stuff gets him to tear up!\n\nOTHER:\nI highly recommend signing up for their email list- They have tons of special events throughout the year and one of them is bound to interest you. We went to the Harry Potter event on Halloween last year and had so much fun! There were special Harry Potter themed decorations and demonstrations, and you could even buy a butterbeer! Most kids were still in school, so it was a really nice time. We already know the museum like the back of our hands, so we could relax waiting for the next demonstration instead of rushing back and forth trying to see everything.\n\nI've been to the BodyWorlds exhibit 3-4 times already; I go whenever it has come around, and hope it will come here again soon! You really get to see the wonder of the human body and see firsthand how different muscles and body functions work-- I recommend more for teens and adults, as kids might be frightened by the whole body aspect. Those with easily upset stomachs will not like it either. \nIf you consider going, just remember; these are real bodies, they were real people, and many of them ARE cut open in various places to illustrate certain concepts. If that makes you feel uneasy, don't go!\n\nThe Arizona Science Center is a pretty cool place for adults looking to break the mold, GREAT for kids, and overall a nice way to spend an afternoon."
1,"My car became disabled in my garage.  Called this towing company on the recommendation from my car dealer.  1st call placed at 10:30am and was told it would be about 90 min.  12:30pm, still no tow.  I called back at this point and was told it would be 30 min and....she took my information again...what did she do lose it or maybe she forgot to order in the first place.  Ugh.  1:30pm (3 hrs. now)  I contemplated calling another company and then I though what if they both came together or the 1st one came for nothing.   So, I still waited (it's not like I'm going anywhere, right?) Finally 2:30pm they arrived.    4hrs people!!!   and not even a call from the office to say oh they're busy or running behind, nothing.  The guy was nice enough, but had a lot of difficulty jumping it to get it out of garage.  I stood and watch as he hooked up the chains and started to pull it onto truck, I'm thinking there must be something I have to sign, so I stepped in the driveway and away he pulls. No goodbye, no thank you, no I'm sorry it took so long.  \nI will never use them again.\nDoesn't anybody give good customer service anymore???????"
0,"Pizza is inconsistent. Sometimes under cooked, other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). Forget ordering chicken wings! It's like pulling teeth!!!! How hard is it to get \"" medium bone out \""? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies \""I guess some one else got your wings\"". Really!? An apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment! I don't recommend going to this Pizza Hut. The service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in. I wish there was a negative star I could rate this place."
1,"As a frequent subway-go-er, this has been the worst subway i've ever gone to. Normally I feel bad about negatively reviewing a place, but after experiencing negative customer service more than 5 times at that location, i'd say it's safe to let it all out. While this place is conveniently close to my work, I am finding myself avoiding it every day during lunch time. Why? the employees frequently pick on me for the specific instructions I have on my sandwich. It seems as though asking for a little avocado is being noted as \""picky\"". I am constantly picked on each time I go in there with constant \""oh im sorry did you want cheese on this side or that?\"", \""girlfriend make up your mind!\"", and \""laughs\"" because I didn't want that extra high caloried 3rd cookie because it's 3 for a dollar (yes i like 2 and only 2 for the sake of not indulging myself...I think thats quite enough for my dollar thank you). As a customer, you're always supposed to walk out with a smile and experience a positive environment. Do I experience any of those? absolutely not, I find myself constantly muttering a bunch of rants each time I walk out in frustration that I as a customer am being picked on!! Perhaps that's their sense of humor, but they should realize that customer service is not a comedy show, and I don't have time for their silly remarks. Additionally, their \""welcome to subway\"" is not welcome at all, especially when you don't even look at the customer while saying it. They're better off just not saying it all if it is not sincere. I will spend the extra dollar and mile to go to chipotle, thanks."
3,"This review is mostly for the Emergency Room.  I had a bike crash on a Friday at lunch hour.  I rode my bike home, to ditch my computer and work files, and to make sure it was safe.  Took a taxi to Good Sam, and it took almost the entire taxi ride for my insurance to verify I was headed to an ER that is \""in Network.\""  Pretty stresful, but once I walked through the doors, most of that changed.\n\nSure, there was a lot of painful waiting around in a hallway in a wheelchair.  But, hey, it's an emergency room.  I found the system to be very organized and the employees to be helpful and compassionate.  There were a couple of fails on the doctor's part.  She offered me pain meds, and then forgot to order them.  I had to ask a nurse, and then they arrived quickly.  Doc also forgot to order antibiotics for my road rash, but I received a voice mail shortly after discharge that hooked me up with germ-fighters.\n \nWhen I was discharged, I indicated I intended to walk to Walgreens, since I live in the neighborhood.  I was referred to the hospital pharmacy, which I expected to soak me.  But it only cost me $14 for 2 kinds of pain meds and stool softener (yes, I said it and no, it hasn't worked yet).  Pharmacy gave me a beeper and I was able to peruse the lovely and overpriced gift shop.  If I was hospitalized, there were many items there that I would appreciate receiving.  Good gift shop.\n\nI was there for approximately 4.5 hours.  I had triage, xrays, and an EKG.  I was admitted immediately, no waiting.  I don't have much experience with ERs, so there you go.\n\nProps to the skinny blond \""tech\"" guy, who entertained me by exchanging restaurant reviews while he irrigated my wound."
3,"Rosita's is alright. I wouldn't file it under authentic Mexican food, but I certainly wouldn't call it Americanized either. Their beginnings were likely with authentic ingredients and recipes, but over time, things change a bit. I would say the best thing at this restaurant isn't on the menu: chips and salsa."
1,"I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only."
3,"my fiance and i are huge fans of mexican food and there's rarely a time that we're not in the mood to eat it.  when a friend told me they served a speciality frozen horchata drink, i knew we had to check it out.\n\nthe frozen horchata is served as a cocktail, and you have the option of getting it with either rum or vodka.  we opted to try both, and they were amazing! i definitely preferred the drink with vodka since it didn't take away from the flavor of the horchata like the rum did. after finishing his drink, my fiance ordered a jamaica margarita with chili on the rim.  i had a couple sips of it and it might have been better than the horchata! \n\nchips and salsa can really make or break a mexican place for me, so i really appreciated that their chips were hot and salty while the salsas (red and green) were spicy and delicious.  \n\ni ordered the chile relleno, and it came out super hot and covered in tons of cheese. i really enjoyed the flavors of it, and was sad that i could only eat about a third of the meal.  the standard bean and rice sides were also really tasty and better than i've had in a while. \n\ni will be definitely adding this place to my regular mexican restaurant rotation!"
0,"I write this as I sit awaiting for my food.  I've been waiting for an hour now.  At a table with 10 other people, and the food is brought out 1 or 2 at a time.  This will be my last visit."
4,"Hey Yall...i knew i would find EXACTLY what I was looking for...I want to tell me peers when they fly in, but I want to keep her a secret....I LOVE ROSITAS...Carmen was my prompt and courteous server...i I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style with rice and beans it came with a side of guacamole and a little lettuce salad. The Carne Asada Steak inside of this burrito was totally undeniably freakin awesome, awesome like a FOODGASM in my mouth the meat was tender, flavorful, juicy, and I could see & taste the spices WHERE IN THE HELL do they do that at well let me tell you ROSITAS. This has to be one of the best things I've ever eaten since I've been in Phoenix, Arizona. The mom and pop setting remind me of home the loud crazy people didn't bother me it's a small restaurant it's time to be expected. Don't do yourself an injustice by leaving if it's crowded what are your items to go. I love guacamole but I didn't enjoy this one because I could tell they add Southwest spices and I like mine plain."
1,"I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down hill."
3,Came here for the menudo. Chips were hot and fresh tasting. Red menudo has a good taste. I still think Caramba's in downtown Glendale has the best menudo although this one is right up there. B-
4,Really good menudo and salsa and fresh chips are a must .. The prices are great and the food is real mexican home cooked meals ...
1,2 stars. Only cause the drink prices are good.
4,"I rear ended someone and the damage to my car was bad! My insurance didn't cover it, so I had to pay completely out of pocket. Ultra Collision fixed my car for HALF the price of all the other estimates I got. Not only did Steven work really hard to get me the best price possible, but the whole process took less than a week and the car looks amazing! I am so happy!"
3,"Every time I go to Whataburger, I get chicken strips. It is the only place I can think of that gives you a piece of toast with your meal."
2,"Open 24/7, thank goodness!\n\nWhen I start work before 6 am at the hospital next door, I stop by and grab a coffee. \n\nSometimes, for those extra long days, I get a warm biscuit with honey, just to give me an added little pep, lol.  Don't judge me ;)\n\nI did try their Taquito with Sausage & Cheese. It was actually good. I asked for both the red and green salsa so I could taste test and see which I liked best. The red salsa won by a landslide.\n\nThe service at this location is always top notch. Friendly and professional."
4,I don't know what everyone else on here is talking about; this Whataburger is super fast!  The entire drive thru process took a grand total of four minutes.  Great place to stop for a quick lunch when you work downtown.
1,"Amongst the worst fast food burgers.  A step up from Sonic, McDonalds, and Jack in the Box, but not nearly as good as the others.  \""Not nearly as good as Burger King\"" ain't the biggest selling point.\n\nWhat in the world is that crap you call a bun?  Easily the worst bun on Earth.  I've had better bread in Africa, no joke.  A step BELOW wonderbread.  Heck, a step below stale wonderbread.  Awful.  You know those burger buns you get in an 8 pack in the grocery store that are all stuck together?  The things you buy because you feel lazy or are strapped for cash?  Those are ok.  Whataburger isn't.  It's far, far, far worse than that.  Look at these pictures.  The bun is like play-doh or a circus peanut.  Gross.  Did you read the part where I said it's worse than food in Africa?  Because it's worse than food in Africa.\n\nI've been here over 10 times because it's open late and I worked third shift for a couple years.  Well, I don't anymore and I tried this place for lunch at noon.  Still awful.  How the heck could anybody like this place?!\n\n2 stars because it isn't McDonalds, although McDonalds has better buns.  But I'd still literally rather get punched than eat a burger with a McDonalds bun.\n\nWhataburger: Worse Than A Punch\n\n\nedit to add:  Also if you go to the drivethrough, expect to wait 20 minutes if there is nobody in front of you.  If there is, play a few hands of solitaire on your dashboard.  Slow as hell."
3,"I had to take a star away.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl and was very disappointed, it tasted really strange and really soggy.  My co-worker said it best, he said it tasted like a frozen meal heated. \n\nI'll stick with the 5 star wraps and salads and leave the 2.5 star bowls for them to keep."
3,"tried this place for the first time today, and i was impressed...\n\nthe place is a little hard to get into though, and i'm sure during a lunch rush it's crazy..\n\ntheir pasta salad is one of the best i've ever had...bowtie noodles, my fav...loaded with green onions so be careful!\n\ni got the bird is the word, which was delicious but lacking a good sauce inside...the pico de gallo was fresh and juicy as was the lettuce..and the wrap was so soft i could sleep on a bed of them...\n\nsuper cute inside."
0,"Only giving one star for the price.  $60 for a hotel room in Phoenix is a steal but doesn't mean the business has to be happy with that.  Start off with cigarette holes in the bed spread, loud housekeeping yelling at each other at 8 in the morning outside our room.  Also when we asked for an extra pillow my wife was told \""oh those are on back order\"". Are you serious, you don't even have half your rooms rented out and we can't have one extra pillow?  All around if you have the ability to stay ANYWHERE else I would do so. Being in a cheap and poorly run hotel isn't worth ruining your stay in a fantastic city."
4,What an amazing organization for empowering women. \n\nThey have a really amazing mentor program. The program starts in some coursework and sociology to sort of prepare us. The classes were a blast and quite useful. The Mentor I met was incredibly helpful warm and kind and had great insight. I really miss our visits since I moved away because she was a wise lady with clear perspective. I really think that the Fresh Start staff went an extra mile and a half by placing me with a mentor who really was perfect for the path that I am on.\n\nFresh Start also brought in some business training associates and gave out scholarships for them. I might have participated had I not been working at the time and had conflicting hours. I was offered a scholarship at the time and I think that any woman who applied herself would qualify.\n\nFresh start has an impressive job database.\n\nThey always had so many wonderful energetic staff who really transmitted a lot of information and light.\n\nReally wonderful organization.\n\nA+++
3,"This place makes really, really authentic Mexican food.  It's part restaurant, bakery, and grocery.  I go here for the Burritos.  Big, soft, house made tortilla and filling! I always order green chile, chicken, deep fried.  It's sooo huge, but good!  You can do Enchilada style or plain, option to add your typical toppings like Guac, sour cream, cheese, etc."
0,Not good. Sorry. I can get pass the decor if the food was good. Keep going. Big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end. Some good reviews???? Must be the workers.  No Flavor unless you add the sauce (a lot)! The server was very kind. So close to Mexico we thought it would be a no brainer.
4,"La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth. \n\nGet the chilaquiles! Get them. \n\nWe also had tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and packed with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalape\u00f1os & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of. \n\nI'll be back to La Tolteca. Five stars no hesitation."
1,"I love hole-in-the-wall taco joints ... usually. Not so here. I got the shredded chicken and the carnitas tacos. Soft corn tortillas, of course. No flavor on either - I guess they really rely on their salsa bar. The carnitas bordered on inedible due to the very hard crust on the meat. Might try this again someday just to try to see how it got so many 5-star reviews, but this trip was barely worth 2."
4,"Having lived in the neighborhood for eight years, I can't say much other than: variety, reliable, authentic. But what I'm really compelled to tell you all about is...\n\nThey now serve Thai! In addition to their already huge menu! \n\nThe Chicken Pad Thai is arguably the best I've ever had (I've had it in New York and San Francisco). Its crazy how good it is... I had to have it two days in a row to confirm. I've had the green curry and that was yummy - fresh veggies in everything, crispy and plentiful.\n\nIMHO, their decor rocks! I love the cheesy waterfall in the front, the chairs with coffee cup designs and giant turntable-centered family-sized tables. The green walls are an upgrade from the pink and blue that was there before. Go to Fate if you want to sit in faux-modern Ikea surroundings.\n\nThis place is classic Mc Do Well"
1,"Let me start with the positive. The corn chicken soup was hot and the won ton chips were a nice addition to the soup. The chicken egg roll was very greasy. My main dish was the cashew chicken. It was white meat but had to pick through it to get a decent piece without icky's on it. The flavor was bland, so I decided to add chili paste. It was hot, but tasteless. It was on the way to downtown, but will note return here again. YUCK!!!"
1,"My third timing coming. I really want to work with them because there's not much Chinese in Phoenix and the staff is super nice; however, the sauce is horrible! More so, it seems like every sushi us cooked in the same hiring, blabs way too sweet sauce. I will not be back."
4,"The sad fact is that most yelpers will eschew this place for it's two more accessible neighbors - Filiberto's and La Santisma - and that is a damn shame, because nestled right between those two restaurants is a superior dining experience.  \n\nTacos Mexico is the truth.  Don't go expecting fancy furniture or Day of The Dead iconography - this place isn't trying to serve you a Disneyland version of Mexico - what it will give you is an authentic taste of some damn fine Mexican tacos.  \n\nPS - their red salsa will burn a hole in your tongue.  If you treat it gingerly, however, you will be treated to a flavor bomb like no other!"
4,"Hands down BEST pinatas I've found in the valley. \n\nA few years ago my favorite pinata store went out of business and I haven't been able to find a replacement up until recently. I throw lots of parties and love having a pinata for any occasion. When I'm looking for a pinata I usually visit multiple stores looking for something specific. What I find is the same old thing and more often than not- covered in dust. \n\nWhen I first walked into Pico Rico I was so please with the selection. Every row I went down I saw something new. There were plenty of varieties so even if it's not for a kids birthday party you'll find something great. Whenever I go back they always have new pinatas I hadn't seen before and something special for whatever holiday is near. The Christmas pinata I bought there was beautiful and unique, I got compliments on it. Their pinatas are very well made. I stuff them with at least 15 lbs. of goodies and they always hold up. On cheaper pinatas the wire will come out when there's too much weight inside. \n\nOther than pinatas they also have a huge selection of Mexican candy, some decorations and balloons. The staff is friendly and helpful. Even though this store is bright fuchsia it's still hard to miss so keep your eyes peeled when driving by."
3,"Our daughter Heather, was born with a congenital heart defect. She has been under the care of a Pediatric Cardiologist since the night she was born. \n\nWe (with the Lords help) believe that she has surpassed most Doctors and has even been told \""I would bet my paycheck (DOCTORS) that you would have had open heart by now!\"" \n\nWhen we moved here to Arizona 3 years ago, we were more concerned about getting a new Pediatric Cardiologist than anything else! We started off at the Cambridge location and did not like the cardiologist we were seeing.\n\nAfter some research we found Dr. Garn at the Dobson Location! All I can say is that we love him and we actually look forward to seeing him for our 6 month check ups. He spends a lot of quality time with us making sure we know exactly what the latest update is on Heather. He seems very thourough and doesn't want to just go in and do a \""heart cath\"" which we are grateful for! Staff is great and wait times are minimal compared to otehr places."
4,Wonderful brunch today! I had the Sunrise sandwich and my husband had the Holy Puerco - they were both delicious. I loved the homemade biscuit - light and fluffy and not dry at all. Everyone in the staff is extremely friendly - very positive and relaxing environment. Highly recommend it!
4,"Had to update my review to share that I had dinner here last weekend for the final day of Arizona Cocktail Week. Of course, I couldn't pass up half priced hurricanes!\n\nI tried the Vegan Po'boy (fried avocado, kale, pico de gallo and chipotle remoulade on french bread) and it was magical...but left me wondering how the heck do you fry avocados? No, seriously??? I'm sure google will tell me later which will lead to fun experiments in the kitchen.... \n\nCustomer service is top notch--everyone that works here is super friendly and the wait time for food wasn't too shabby. I really love the vibe of this place and predict many visits in the future. Day or night, this place is one of the top restaurants in Phoenix."
4,"GREAT music and tons of fun! LOVE the music!! Fridays is mainly for \""cheros\"" aka\nguys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music. Not\nreally my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going. Saturdays is hip hop,\nreggaeton, and house music which is the main day it gets POPIN!  After 2 it turns 18\nand over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. \nNOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind of\nplace.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot more\neye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle its\nmore of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impress\nanyone.  From experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its true.\nBathrooms: Yea they're kinda small but um im there to party... if your worried about the\nbathrooms LMAO please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you.  \nPrices: People say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap... if your\nhard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute Latino will buy your drinks for u duh!"
0,"By far the worst gay nightclub in phoenix and trust me I know gay nightclubs!!! \nLol no seriously this place is crap I have been suckered to come here a few times for a birthday party and some other events and it's no fun the drag show is lame or the acts I have seen are the Dj is good plays some different tunes the a/c is non existent I think they use a swamp cooler. The bathroom is the size of a toilet stall and always packed that u have to piss in the alley where there is plenty of hookers at your disposal. The drinks are expensive, watered down and even the soda tasted funny the bar tender was very nice and friendly. Never tried the food outside but I hear it's great, the parking is another disaster there is limited space and the night we went there was a few break ins in the back parking lot near liquor store. Just being honest but the bad outweighs the good at this club, give it a shot at your own risk but remember I warned you."
2,"This is a ghetto place, no offense.  The girls are happy, customers are happy, but put your game face on when you walk in.  The place is a money machine for the owner, low overhead, positive cash flow.  \n\nWhy is this place called bandaids show lounge?  Because its small, the dancers wear less than bikinis, and/or the building is long and skinny like a bandaid.  There are three stages, really just two 2x2 raised areas, and a bigger main stage. This place could be a set for a movie scene requiring a ghetto strip club.  Dont get me wrong, its colorful, lots of character.  When it comes to strip clubs, the main thing is the talent.  This place has a lot of local talent.  And one or two top tier girls, either by virtue of body, youth, personality, or some combination.  Saturday this place was crowded up until 2am, of course, it only takes a few people in a small place, but still.  Top girl - in my opinion, phoenix.  21 (stated age) and hot.  She could be 16, 17, 18.  Thin body, white."
4,"I have been seen by the Nurse Practitioner Christa and Dr. Laura Kimbro so far. Both experieces have been good. They are really good about following up with you. They can do ultrasounds right in the office if your insurance covers it.  They do all their baby deliveries at Banner Desert.\n\nOne small complaint...they take the whole thanksgiving weekend off. Although there is someone always on call, it would be nice if they were open that friday."
4,"Disney Land for Foodies. Fresh Baked Goods, Salsas, Mexican dishes (the torta cubana is to die for) and an awesome atmosphere, plus more produce than the human eye should ever behold. My favorite place in Phoenix."
3,"Oh the joy of walking thru Ranch Market... loved the produce section . lower prices , bigger bunches of cilantro , onions and other goodies...pineapples for 2lbs for .99 ? Yes please!  With my buddy Tom as my guide we perused and discussed  all foods  Hispanic.. we talked cremas, with me buying something close to a creme fraiche,  and a arroz conleche that might make stop by there every time I am near..that is some good rice pudding.  We also  looked over their large selections of  dried chiles  for my chili carne I am working on.   My husband  found yummy morsels of ceviche  to his liking and he also tried a  variety of streets tacos.   Loved this adventure in food and look forward to going back .."
4,"I used to love Pro's but, being slightly out of my way, my trips became less and less often. Then I got a coupon flyer for the *new* Los Altos Ranch Market. I was like, \""$5 off a $25 purchase, SAY WHAAAT?\"" Turns our Pro's had gone into bankruptcy and emerged under the joint ownership of a couple other Hispanic market chains. Fun facts but the coupon got me down there Saturday morning. \n\nSame old Ranch Market with shoes for sale up front, the assortment of prepared food, drink, and bakery items, and chicharones from bite size to mucho grande. I like their produce and meat selection but wish they carried salmon other than the frozen bags. Still, it was a good reminder of the shopping experiences I had before my current battles at my local Fry's and Basha's stores. I suggest we all commit to hitting Ranch Market a little more."
1,"Did not live up to the hype.\n\nWe went looking for those \""intelligent\"" dog toys... you know, the puzzle type deals where they have to figure it out to get the treats. They listed about a dozen of them on their website.\n\nThe girl at the front looked like she was about to leap the counter and chase me down, because we headed into the warehouse and I didn't hear her go \""Ma'am? Ma'am?!\""  the first time. (GRAH, don't call me \""ma'am\"", I'm only 21, dammit!)   \nWhen I did hear her and turn around, she told me I had to leave my purse up front, which REALLY, REALLY ticked me off. I carry a very expensive bag and it usually has a very expensive phone and wallet full of cash in it. I do not let it out of my sight, ever. Ask any girl - being asked to leave your purse with someone just makes us uncomfortable. \n\nAside to the owner/managers:\nDear Ryan's, I'm sorry you have been stolen from, but that's a hard fact of retail business. Maybe 1 in 500 people will steal and it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be, ya cheapskates. You can absorb a $3 toy here and there. It's really insulting to be treated as untrustworthy and a criminal when you haven't done anything.\n\n(The purse bit set the tone for the whole trip). \n\nThe place was very dim (I know it's a warehouse, but it shouldn't be a 2/5 on the light intensity scale).\n\nThe prices were maybe $1.50 below retail stores at the most. It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10 minutes away, sure. \n\nThere were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed miffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we were down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing at the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when the girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super creepy.\n\n80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's mouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he needs tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it. I saw nothing truly suitable, unless we somehow missed it (and we walked through twice).\n\nTo top it off, they only carried 3 of the puzzle type toys, when they showed a dozen on their website. Nothing like driving to central Phoenix from Scottsdale and not having what you came for. Again, we looked everywhere in the warehouse and didn't see any more.\n\nWe left with the \""Dog Tornado\"" (which is quite fun) and a knotted rope that looked pretty tough, but my dog has had it for about 30 minutes and has chewed halfway through the knot in the middle... Le sigh."
0,"I have to down vote this business for a terrible customer service experience. \n\nOn a blazing hot Friday afternoon I left work early and drove all the way down to McDowell to pick up some toys for my dog. I walked up and saw the posted hours-- 4:30pm close, and my watch was just about at 4:30. I reached to open the door, unsure if it would be locked-- to my pleasant surprise, it was still open, I was so excited. The cashiers allowed me to head back to the warehouse-- again, I was relieved! I made a beeline for the toys and just a few feet before I reached them one of the workers pops out, literally stands in the middle of the aisle with his arms crossed (as if I were trying get backstage at a concert), and tells me the business is closed and that I had to leave. I told him that I just needed to grab a couple of toys, that I would need 2 minutes (under the circumstances, I would have been quick), but he wouldn't let me pass. When I politely persisted he asked me what toys I was interested in, and told me he would get them for me. I told him that I couldn't possibly know what they had in stock and that I just needed to visually see what they had (and how the heck do you describe some of these dog toys anyway??). No dice, he told me that I had to go. Really?? \n\nInflexible, embarrassing, and a total wasted trip. I was steamed. Rather than ask for a manager when I was agitated, I decided to drive home and email customer service. They emailed back the following Monday and told me, essentially, the employee did was he was supposed to do, blaming it on concern for customer safety with all of the heavy equipment they utilize after hours in the warehouse. Mind you that I had been let in building, that nobody stopped me from entering the warehouse, that it had maybe just turned 4:30, that there were other customers there, that there was no heavy equipment in sight and that I had asked for 2 minutes. They were perfectly fine with their employee telling me that I had to leave, and they made no effort to keep a repeat customer.\n\nBummer, I was so excited to learn of Ryan's Pet Supplies a couple of years ago-- and indeed, they have a great selection at terrific prices, I considered it worth the burden of driving into a bad area with restricted hours. I had given them all of my business ever since. Now I will never go back again, and I will let everyone know that Ryan's Pet Supplies couldn't care less about their customers."
3,"We stopped here later at night because Two Hippies Beach House was closed.  I'm glad we did, because the food was pretty decent.  I was a little nervous walking in because the whole place was empty, but that might have been because it was about to close (which we unfortunately didn't realize...so we left a generous tip ;) ).\n\nMy fiance asked, as he always does: \""what's good here?\""  The guy at the counter responded \""anything seafood!\""  Of course. It's not called Mariscos for nothin'.\n\nSo I ordered two shrimp tacos and one grilled marlin taco, since I'd never had marlin before.  All were delicious.  I didn't realize the shrimp in the tacos would be breaded, which I usually don't like, but it was pretty good.  The shrimp tasted good and juicy, and the toppings were nice (cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro).  The horchata seemed like it was homemade, and it was delicious.  The chips weren't the best, and they gave us a green salsa, which my fiance said would be too hot for me, so I didn't try it.\n\nI took a look at their full menu while I was waiting for my food and they have a very decent selection.  We will definitely be back. Soon :)"
3,"One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.\n\nSo - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.\n\nThe guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.\n\nWe went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.\n\nNext stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)\n\nResults - \n     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.\n          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~\n     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.\n          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~\n     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.\n          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.\n\nSo, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.  I can't help but wonder what our next scientific food research challenge will be!"
1,This place always runs out of items on the menu. I've ordered the chicken fried steak twice and it never comes with the fresh bread they advertise. In this visit alone I've heard the waitress tell two tables they didn't have baked potatoe or a breakfast item. Our waitress appeared lithargic and took a long cigarette break while all her tables waited on her and the cook. It was bad enough she didn't check up on her guest often enough. The team leader is no better. She's helped us twice before. Never smiles. its enough to make someone depressed. Luckly the food they have is great on an empty stomach. Love the unlimited hot coco. Avoid the water. Tastes like algee.
1,"My husband and I branched out to a new restaurant this weekend (Coronado Cafe in Phoenix) - our experience is why we don't like to branch out to new restaurants.  For starters, the host sat us and said \""we have a party coming in at 7pm; do you think you will be done by then?\""  After that warm welcome we found our water glasses had lipstick on them (both of the glasses).  We ordered the bruschetta (pretty good); my husband had the bacon/cheese burger and I had the meatloaf sandwich.  Burger was good, sandwich was very mediocre.  For the money and the food, we probably wouldn't go back.  The inside of the restaurant was very charming but that is about the extent of what impressed us."
1,"I just moved into a new place, and Coronado Cafe is right around the corner. The menu looks great, the wine list is well-rounded, and the opportunity to stumble home after several glasses of vino gave this place major points before I'd stepped in the door. I WANTED to like it, but I'm not sure that I'll go back.\n\nMy fiancee and I were seated by a friendly hostess at a small table in a cozy room at the back of the restaurant (house). It had the opportunity to be intimate, but it was over-lit, and we felt awkward hearing every word of our neighbors' conversation. \n\nWe started with the Brie and Lavash, which was wonderful. All of the flavors melded together perfectly. Around the same time we ordered a bottle of wine. Our waiter poured us a glass, and that was the last time he touched our bottle for the rest of the night.\n\nFor entrees I got the penne pasta in a green chile cream sauce (rich and tasty--one of the few vegetarian entree options), and the fiancee went with the pork tenderloin (dry and chewy). The portion that he was served was the end of the tenderloin--a piece that rarely makes it onto the plate as an entree because it is notorious for being tough and dry. Our server never came back to check on our food, so we didn't have a chance to make it right. \n\nTo sum it up: a snotty, inattentive waiter and hit or miss food. It might be best to go for an appetizer and bottle of wine. Just be prepared to pour it yourself."
1,"Having had numerous favorable experiences at Coronado Cafe in the past, we were deeply disappointed at our most recent, and regrettably probably our last visit.  The evening was off to a great start with the predictably excellent crab cakes.  While the driver scallops were equally delicious, the chimichurri-style rib-eye was barely edible.  Despite being cooked properly - medium rare - the meat had a strange after taste.  After struggling with the steak - and subsisting on two shared scallops in exchange for some steak  - not an even trade by ANY measure - we told our waiter of the disappointment, at which point he spirited away the plate.  Since I was soon to be finished with the scallops (having shared half with my dining partner with the barely edible steak).\n\nThe waiter provided some explanation behind the problem with the steak when he advised that the chimichurri included vinegar and lime - two odd ingredients for a rib-eye, which accounted for the bitter after taste.\n\nThe response of Coronado to apparently weigh the returned entree to determine the \""discount\""  was an insult as it suggested that we should have either been forced to eat alone (i.e., return the steak after the first bite) rather than enjoy our meal together.  Had they tasted the meat rather than focused on the weight perhaps they would have realized how unpleasant the meal was.\n\nAs we have ample other dining options available to us on our \""short\"" list, we will not be returning anytime soon to Coronado\nBill and Bob Phoenix"
3,"This place is great. It is set up in a little house with a really cute atmosphere. They have a great patio and a fantastic personality. \n\nI was there for lunch and had a tuna melt. It was good, but the side of mac and cheese was the best!!! I want to go back and try some of their crab cakes/crab dip (they tout their crab here as being the best around), and of course a side of mac and cheese. The seating is a bit close together and the prices are a little high, but it is great for an occasional lunch or special occasion."
2,Lite lunch with the ladies.  Two of us shared Crab Cakes and Caprese salad.  I could have eaten an entire platter full of the crab cakes.
3,"A good restaurant deserving of at least 4 stars and the potential to earn 5. \n\nWent there with my fiance for dinner.  We had the portobello sandwich ($11) and the green chili pasta with salmon ($19).   The sandwich was good, everything tasted fresh, but nothing \""special\"" about it to warrant 5 stars.  It came with a side and we chose the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was actually phenomenal, not too heavy with cheese, but had a perfect amount of bread crumbs giving it a nice crunch.  \n\nThe green chille pasta tasted great...for the first few bits...then good for the next few bites....then edible for the next few bites...and then at the end I just felt like a pig.  Not used to eating cream based pasta.  This would be great as an appetizer for the table to split, but too heavy for me to eat for a meal.  The piece of salmon that came on top was thick and definitely a generous portion.  However, it was a bit pink on the inside (we ate it anyway, too hungry to send it back).  Nevertheless, still tasty.  The menu said that the pasta dish came with tomato bruschetta, but the waitress did not bring any bruschetta.  So, I asked her for bread and she did bring a french baguette which was good, although the bruschetta probably would have gone better with the meal.\n\nWill definitely be back to try some other items on their menu that are a little less heavy than the pasta."
1,Expensive and just ok.
3,"This place is definitely a favorite.  We've had really excellent experiences here (dinner and brunch)  - except for the most recent one.\n\nThe atmostphere is romantic - a cozy old house with cute little rooms, small tables with checked table cloth, soft lighting, the works.  They have fine food that's worth the price and it's a great date night experience.\n\nOn this last visit, our server was incredibly slow, beyond reasonable levels. She was nice enough, but we ended up running late for our next engagement, even though we arrived quite early.  She even took over five minutes processing our credit card after we said we were in a hurry, twice.  The restaurant was far from packed fairly early on a Thursday.  The people near us came in later and left earlier with the same number of courses (and a good server).  \n\nIn addition to being slow, she wasn't very helpful.  We ordered the crab cakes, which came with vegetables that were a little bland, and the stuffed pepper, which was so spicy that my husband and I both burned our mouths.  The server eventually came by and asked how we liked our food, and when we mentioned the screaming spice, she specifically said the dish wasn't meant to be at all spicy - then proceeded to do nothing about it.  Thank goodness another server who had a table nearby kept our waters full. \n\nOur shrimp cocktail appetizer had big, beautiful shrimp, and our creme brulee dessert was delicious.  The crab cakes themselves were great, and I could tell that the pepper dish would have been nice, if it hadn't been so incredibly spicy.  They clearly just forgot to clean out the seeds.\n\nLuckily, my husband and I were in good spirits and the poor service and food issues didn't put a damper on our night.  \n\nWe've been here many times and tried many menu items, including the crab cake sandwich, the meatloaf, the crab benedict at brunch, their mimosa and bloody mary, etc.  We've never had poor service or over-spicy food before, so I am leaving this review at 4 stars - it's an average of two for this visit and 5 for every other time we've visited."
3,"I miss this place.  I used to work right across the street from McAlp's and would go there at least twice a week.  The atmosphere is great, food is good, and deserts are tasty.  Its nice to see that some places in the Phoenix area don't feel the need to constantly renovate and are not afraid to keep their days gone by look, feel and approach to business.  Writing this is making me hungry for their food again.  I need to find an appointment to schedule downtown so I can lunch there next week."
2,"It was 10:45 Saturday morning and I wanted coffee. I knew of a place right down the street from me and to my disappointment it was closed! WTF! Any way I went searching for a cafe. I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \""Best lunch in town!\"" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself \""Yes, i think I will\"". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly. But I want to go again, with company, not by myself and I'll rate it again."
1,"This place is fun to walk into, as it really looks like you're walking into a Depression era drugstore, not the 50's. It's crammed with old pharmacy stuff and signs, just lots to look at.\nI really wanted to love this place but I can't because the service just isn't what it should be. We were helped by two of the staff during our visit, one very friendly waitress who breezed by and said hello  and a waiter who couldn't have appeared more miserable.  \nI was surprised at how small and, hate to say it, dull, the menu is. Burgers, hot dogs and cold sandwiches. The burgers are from frozen patties and I actually had to pull a big chunk of cartilage out of my mouth. Yuck.\nThey use Thrifty brand ice cream and have an extensive menu of ice cream sodas made with unusual flavors. We ordered our sundaes and for some reason, they were made one at a time, so that my companion was halfway through with his before mine was delivered, and it was completely wrong. Wrong ice cream, wrong topping. But it took so long to get that I just ate it. I'm not going to complain too bitterly over ice cream. And I hope this place works out its kinks and does well."
4,You can't beat the atmosphere at this place. I bought a google offer for here a while ago and stopped in on a Sunday afternoon. There were some people inside but it wasn't too crowded. I started in the antique shop wandering around and then made it into the restaurant. I had an ice-cream soda and it was divine. Next time I'd probably split one as the drinks are large. I didn't eat anything but the food looked yummy. I also wandered to the vintage shop next door. It was fun looking around and reminscing.
2,"For a spark of nostalgia and a sweet treat, this is a wonderful destination.  From the pink sodashop dresses and bright red lipstick of the wait staff, to the old jukebox, half a century old coke advertisements, blenders from the 60s that are still making your malts and shakes today, to the vintage booths and trinkets that line the walls of this shop it is a virtual museum of soda shop days.\n\nThere are 99 flavors for your cream sodas, italian sodas, shakes, phosphates (phosphoric acid is included to give a flat sour taste) as well as egg creams (milk, choc syrup, and soda water).  The flavors range from bubble gum and marshmallow to pickle and hurricane.  Mac's also has its own signature concoctions.\n\nSundaes and banana splits are also on the menu, and for an average of $5 it is definitely worth it.  I just would not recommend coming here to eat.\n\nThe food is unremarkable and lacks the kind of flavor and texture that would make it memorable.\n\nFor hot summer days, date nights, and sweet rewards, a little venture through time, definitely worth a visit."
2,"Macaplines.. Go here for nostalgia, and a swell soda, float, or sundae. *Don't* go here for food. I've been to this place several times, I really enjoy the deserts and sodas. I've ordered food here a few times, and it just tastes so blah. I would really love it if they bought local and had more \""live\"" food options. Everything just tastes \""dead\"" and flavor less. The tomatoes and other veggies that I had were green and as tasteless as anything I'd get at a fast food joint. There are *very* limited vegetarian options, and maybe 1? vegan option.\n\nThey have a neat shop for clothing, jewlery, furniture, and bric a brac from days gone by. Sometimes I just stop by the shop."
1,"I can understand how this location can get some extra points for being quaint  but it will certainly not get points for being clean.  The soda I had was great but I could not get over how dirty and run down this place was.  The staff where inattentive and to be honest completely useless, the tile on the floor was pealing off, the bar looked very warn and the booth we sat in was sticky. I understand the concept but I cannot forgive dirt when I visited a location.   I won't be back again."
4,"great place and atmosphere, great ice cream and malts."
1,"Went there for the first time in a long time.   Food was mediocre at best.   Chef's salad was probably the poorest one I have had in a long time.   Vegetables were fresh and of a sufficient quantity.   However,  the hard boiled egg was food service.  No bacon, which almost always comes in a chef's salad.  Meats were the cheapest of the cheap.  Couldn't really pick out what the flavor was, with the exception of sodium. \n\nWent here with an Entertainment BOGO.  The small print on the coupon stated after 5 PM.  I missed the fine print,  but the server didn't.  Interesting to note that they close at 7 PM.  This is a very short window.   IF we had gotten the BOGO,  the rating probably would have been a 3.  \n\nWould we come back?   Possibly after 5 PM to use the BOGO if we were in the area.  Definitely would not make this a destination, however."
4,The Best Bean Burro Enchilada Style EVER!!
3,"Muy bueno!  Here's a hidden treasure in the old Garfield barrio.  It's located right next to Garfield Elementary School, so if you passed the school, you went too far.  \n\nWhen you go in, it's like going into someone's house and ordering from their kitchen.  This place is a total hole-in-the-wall.  Also important to note that it is a cash-only establishment.\n\nThey only serve burritos & chimichangas NO TACOS.  Their burritos are extremely runny but extremely yummy and will literally explode in your mouth.  I recommend ordering a dozen tortillas on your way out.  \n\nCheck out Rito's when you're feeling adventurous and wanna hang out the locals in the barrio."
3,"Red Chile Burro, Enchilada Style. \nDONE AND DONE!\n\nShow up on Saturday or Tuesday and you MIGHT be blessed with tacos made by Nana. I've been coming here for 5 years (which makes me a newbie) and while at first I thought the burros were a bit off in the red chile/tortilla ratio, you won't forget the flavor of the red chile. One morning, you'll wake up after a night of too much fun and CRAVE Rito's.\n\nFamily owned and operated this little gem is worth the weight (and wait) in gold. Just don't forget...cash only!"
3,"Rito's easily has the best red chile and beans in the world, maybe even universe- now that Pluto is not a planet. \n\nDon't be scared by the wussies that say the area is scary- I guess when you live in Sun City- the big city can be scary. On any given day the place will be packed with city workers, CPAs, medical staff from Good Sam, teachers and the occasional sketchy dude. \n\nThis family owned spot puts out amazingly good food. The menu is limited-but it's all about quality not quantity. I do not feel that the food is overpriced at all. You are buying fresh made food with soul-if you want heartless crap hit Taco Hell on McDowell. \n\nIf you live a charmed life and they're selling tacos when you are there- for the love of heysoos- buy three. The guacamole tacos are amazing. If they were to become illegal- I would rob old people so I could support my habit.\n\nIf only they would step up their game and offer fountain drinks- that would be great. Cans of soda do not help during hot summer months."
2,I think Rito's is overpriced for what you get. The burritos look huge because they use an over sized tortilla that hides the tiny amount of meat they use so most bites are filled with tortilla not meat. If the green chile burrito I ordered was filled with meat then maybe it would be worth $8. The beans were above average and I thought their salsa was amazing even though they charge 25 cents for two tablespoons of it. I expected to be blown away by the food here but it tasted just like the food I grew up eating. It made me want to hug my mom :)
1,"It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.  \nI'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps."
0,"Incredibly slow service (25 minutes to get 3 basic tacos) and tacos are average at best.  My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.  Reminds me of a traditional western jailhouse except someone is actually taking food orders."
2,"Yes, I'd say A-OK for Stanley's.  Their sausages range from okay (kabanosy) to quite good (spicy kolbasz) but I'd agree that they're a bit on the pricy side.  \nI usually patronize their Bell Rd. location as it's closer to my house, but I ate lunch here a few weeks ago since I was in the 'hood.  It was right before Christmas and the place was JAM packed with everyone getting their holiday goodies.  The kielbasa sandwich was fine, they also have subs and other cold cut type sandwiches.\nThough they don't really hold a candle to some of the awesome Polish deli's back in Chicago, it's probably about the best you'll find out here in Phoenix."
3,"On a recent vacation to Mexico, my mom asked Jared and I where the best Mexican food in Phoenix was... This place immediately came to mind for us both!\n\nWhen you walk into the door of Mariscos Playa Hermosa, you feel like you very well may be in Mexico.  It feels extremely authentic, with a festive atmosphere, a staff that doesn't speak too much English, and food that is delicioso!  It's nothing like the Americanized Mexican / Latin places  you've been to before. \n\nDon't load up on the chips and salsa as the portions are big and you'll want to save room for what is to come.  Their house iced tea is very good if you want something other than a cold cerveza.\n\nAs Annie D said in her review, I highly recommend going with the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. You can't go wrong with that!  I ordered something else and ate off of Jared's Molcajete Caliente along with my own.  That sauce is incredible!\n\nNote that this place closes early during the week.  We met some friends there at 7pm and at 8:20 we were the last ones in there and we could tell the staff was ready to go home.  \n\nI can't wait to return to this local gem of a restauran for another memorable meal very soon."
4,"Hands down the best mariscos(seafood) EVER! I love the shrimp ceviche and when I am in the mood for a hot plate the Shrimp Culichi is the best choice, shrimp soaked in some delicious green salsa and smothered with oaxaca cheese, YUMMY! The Micheladas and the margaritas are excellent and well priced.  They have Mariachis every friday night from 7p to 9p, if you want the trip to Mexico feel, this is your place!!"
4,"Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong."
2,"The service was pretty fast. I was not too impressed with food. Ordered the culichi shrimp and a consume. My rice was undercooked, there was literally 5 shrimps in the green sauce. The sauce was very watered down. My consume was pretty flavorless, I added salt and limes sadly it didn't help. It was not the best I had but not the worst. Would not come here again."
0,Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can't see the food on your plate. Underwhelming and overpriced.
4,"Another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city! I really liked the Desert Botanical Gardens and I am totally not into flowers or botany!  We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias, but it was so dark that we couldn't see much. I'm glad we returned in the daylight.\n\nWe took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG. My father-in-law is totally into photography, so DBG was awesome for him. We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus. There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.\n\nThere is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time. You see everything and are ready to leave by the end.  A very nice place to take visitors on a nice day."
2,"Dropping some stars due to the Luminaria policy. Myself and four friends bought tickets to the luminarias a bit ago. It rained today, so the luminarias were canceled, which I understand. However, as the event is sold out every other night, we were told we could not get tickets for another night and could get a refund or donate our ticket money. I do appreciate the refund, and I know they cannot control the weather, but I do think it stinks that we will miss the luminarias through no fault of our own."
2,"I've been to the gardens 3 times and that's why I'm giving it an overall 3 rating, my experiences were very different.\n\nOriginally, I attended in the spring a couple years ago, during the week, but during the butterfly exhibit.  At this time I think it cost $7 to enter the gardens.  It was a nice visit, calm and beautiful.\n\nMy second visit was during the luminarias (sp?) at Christmas time.  It helps that I had free passes, but this was a great visit as well.  Beautiful to see the gardens as night and wander, quite romantic.  The musical stops were pleasant and the wine samplings excellent.\n\nMy third visit this week disappointed me.  While the Chihuly exhibit is interesting, the crowd it attracts makes it more of a disappointment than a pleasure for me.  Many people there only for the glass who were disrespectful of those pausing to see the plants, being loud, and lots of misbehaving children who would rather be somewhere made for children.  Also, the gardens are now $15 + $3 to see the butterfly exhibit.  That's getting a little crazy.  Make sure you get online and get a coupon.  \n\nOverall, the gardens will always be a place I take my parents when they are in town.  But I'll look for a slower time to attend."
4,"Another weekend of visiting Phoenix and what the hell am I gonna do besides eat?\n\nUnfortunately, Phoenix didn't have an array of free places to visit, besides walking around downtown or their version of Old Town. Being from San Diego, I got spoiled by being able to walk around the beaches, Balboa Park, Seaport Village, the Gaslamp District.... You get the picture.\n\nThough the Desert Botanical Garden isn't free ($15 per adult), I gotta say that this has to be on everyone's to visit list, if one ever goes to Phoenix. The desert garden is pretty amazing, with all it's wild life and vegetation. Walking around the garden paths, we spotted lizards, cacti and birds galore! I even saw a garden gnome (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IdCOpMsZ67g-oQZLgAsnOA?select=-TOj_E-xHmaOBW9NggUMmg). No joke!\n\nCoincidentally, the DBG happened to be hosting the Chihuly Glass exhibit, while we visited. So, we got more bang for our buck. For an additional $3, we also got to see the Butterfly Exihibit. Entertaining since butterflies were on people, as well as plants. Pretty cool, considering we spent almost 3 hours here.\n\nA definite MUST. And, though the Chihuly Exhibit is now done and gone, I do look forward to visiting, again, and hopefully checking out another exhibit."
4,"Awesome!\n\nGrowing up in Scottsdale, I never went to the botanical gardens. I mean come on, what's there to do there? It's not the same as going to the zoo.\n\nBut now, it's a must. Go around dusk or check out their website for one of their events. The Chihuly Exhibit was pretty cool last year. And that's what I like, they're more than just a bunch of cacti. \n\nBring a camera."
3,"I love the garden.  I go walking here 3-4 nights a week, because I work close by.  I have a couple of spots I love to sit and commune with nature.  I can't tell you, because then I'd have to kill you.  Bunnies, frogs, lizards, quail...love to watch the wildlife.  I keep missing the king snake, who lives near the patio cafe.  I only wish people would realize it's a garden, not a playground or amusement park.  Modulate your voices, please!"
3,"At the DBG's for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughter's wedding. From the very beginning, Amber that young lady who worked with us was professional, on the ball and organized...far more than I can say about the wedding planner. I believe she must be the park's event coordinator and totally rocked it. \n\nThe place is truly beautiful, so different from what a \""traditional\"" garden looks like. Read the other reviews and the other folks will give you a much better idea of the type of plants, bugs, small animals, or as my granddaughter loudly proclaimed \"" the birds with the hats!\"" \n\nThere were four other wedding going on the afternoon (4/29/11) but we never really heard much except for some far away music. Signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site *and the rehearsal the night before) and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use. \n\nThere was a very large room with shuttered windows and AC where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller, similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves. After the wedding, as the chairs and such were put away, the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour. \n\nMy daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars. \n\nIf you have your wedding at this particular site, park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area. It is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads \""Service area only.\"" I understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day, it would've been so much better to park in back and take a 5 min. walk as opposed to an agonizing 15 min. stroll. \nIt was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended, it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out. \n\nIt was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking (you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesn't eat in the dark.) Lovely place to have a party or wedding, parking not so great. \n\nThank you DBG for making my daughter's wedding so very memorable!"
2,"A great place, no doubt, but with admission at $18 per adult, it has the feel of an expensive tourist trap.  Why pay so much for someone to \""show you nature\""?\n\nMy suggestion: Go out and explore the desert on your own.\n\n-Hike in the Phoenix Mountains Preserve area. (One of many parks.)\n-Explore the saguaros and lush desert outside the city. (My favorite region is toward Florence Junction & Superior along US Highway 60.)\n-Visit a retail cactus farm. (There are many!)\n\nThen again, if you're a tourist and don't mind spending the money, go for it."
4,"This is one of my favorite escapes from the city while still within the city! I've lived in AZ for a year and have been visiting DBG on average once a month since my arrival in the serenity of the Sonoran. The way the plants take on a different character and color at various times throughout the year.....lovely! The paths are well-maintained, the staff and volunteers all seem to enjoy their surroundings, and the guests of all ages seem as contented as I feel while meandering through cacti, succulents, grasses, herbs, flowering plants, and the AWESOME SCULPTURES that just pop a color into view at the best turns! \n\nI have a few events on my calendar for this coming Fall, including Music in the Garden, and I will definitely be taking more houseguests to DBG as part of my \""AZ favorites\"" tour :)\n\nI was impressed with the Butterfly Pavilion when we visited on 4/9/13.....plenty of species to get up close and personal with! My nephew also got a kick out of the flashlight tour that we enjoyed in May of this year.......get there to get out of the city!"
3,"Love the Chihuly Art throughout the gardens, I was bummed that the cafe was closed. It's definitely a great walk this great scenery! Lovely for photos!"
3,"We went to the 8 to midnight viewing.   My take is that it was a one note show.  It was the light up Chihulu glass.  The 4 to 8 would have had the butterflies, the plants and then the glass sculptures.  It was very crowded, which was surprising to me.  There is a coupon for $2 and another deal for 20 % off with AAA.  I did not try to combine them.  My kids went off by themselves and came back with their face painted, which was free and fun.  My wife has a broken foot so we got her the wheel chair for just the $20 deposit, which went without a problem."
4,"This review is mainly based on the Chihuly Exhibit and the wonderful job Desert Botanical Gardens does to keep this place looking simply fabulous.\n\nBeen here a few times throughout my stay in PHX and each time we come back it gets better and better. The place looks a lot bigger than we remembered and had more paths and special interest to enjoy than last time.\n\nCame with the family and used a Groupon thingamajig. Daughter is a coupon clipper and did a great job on this one. We could not decide whether to see the Chihuly exhibit at night or first thing in the morning. Granddaughter was with us so we decided to go with the early morning adventure and we were not disappointed.\n\nWow is all we can say. What an amazing selection of cactus, desert trees and bushes from all over the world. There are even wildflowers and tons of different critters and birds that make themselves right at home. It was fun watching everyone shooting pictures of just about anything that moved or sweet family photos next to something extravagant or amazing.\n\nThis is always been a great place to take people from out of town or just a great way to get some exercise while enjoying the heavenly works sent from above. We probably walked close to a couple of miles before we were done.\n\nBring your sunscreen, shady hat, some good walking shoes and plenty of liquids to drink. The dessert can take the life right out of you if you are not careful. So be cool and stay hydrated and rest in the shade when you get a chance. MOST EXCELLENT!\n\n4.75 STARS"
4,What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go.
0,"Terrible. Sergios installed sod at my house and didn't bring a roller. The \""crew\"" didn't even know what one was. When I called the office they told me another crew would come later in the day to roll it. I went ahead and paid. Big mistake. They never came back. The job came out terribly.  When I tried to follow up they ignore my messages. I recommend going with someone who's more honest and reputable."
1,The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.
3,"Big rooms. Clean but have a smell to them. The included 7a-10a buffet breakfast is good (needs sausages,though). Nice to have that refrigerator & microwave,too. Free shuttle to the airport on the half hour was extremely convenient. Tipping at breakfast and with the shuttle (which can take or pick you up at places in less than a 2 mile radius) is appreciated just the same as you would your housekeeper."
4,"Very Cute and Cozy Place! \n\nThe Food was AMAZING! \nSeriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon! \n\nI got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics) \n\nEverything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious! \n\nI would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!"
0,"I have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work, and I must say that the first time I was there, the service was slow and the food mediocre.  The last two times I went there, it was not by my choice but by group consensus.  The food is also mediocre at best, having a friend whose mother is from El Salvador, this food was terrible, absolutely terrible in comparison.  The beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water, and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water, 1 part hot sauce.  Each time I went there I called ahead and placed my order, and I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min. to wait for my food (after ordering ahead!!).  I brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant, and they told me, in their exact words, it's not their problem, and if I had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer, they have many more waiting.  I don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly.  I have been overcharged and never received items that I have ordered that were still on my check and I had to argue with the owner.  It is by far the worst service I have ever received in this city.  About 5 people I work with have all sworn to never return to this store."
3,I really like this place. We used to come here often and then didn't for a long time just because we weren't in the hood when they were open. The las two weeks I've been by and had a late lunch. The people that t=run this place are so genuinely nice. The ensalada drink is refreshing in this heat. I usually get a veg papusa and fried plantain. My husband had the chicken soup and loved it and then the chicken special and loved it. I'm so glad we went back.
3,"Loved this place.  The service was great, the restaurant was spotless, the food was really great and it was very affordable.  The Pupusa's were amazing!  I also loved their mango iced tea and the desserts were really tasty as well."
0,Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!
2,"Not a bad place. Service is good with friendly employees. The food, although not the beat does taste good and is fresh.  While there I had the angry whopper. Im not a fan of thick french fries, but theirs was still good. \n\nWhat I liked most was their choices of soda. They have \""orange coke\"" flavored soda. I never even heard of it before, so I had to try and and wow. Was it good.  \n\nSadly the whole time I was thinking there they never swept the floor that needed it. Yeah its a small thing and I am not going to eat off it, but visually it is not appealing. The same is true of their bathroom floor."
2,"It's old.  It's tired.  The Embassy Suites here on North 44th hasn't changed much in the last several years.  But it's the only place we baseball fans prefer to stay.\n\nSure, we could stay at the Marriott and carouse with the baseball players, but it's too expensive over there and it's not our style.  The Embassy Suites has breakfast made to order in the morning, and free cocktails at night.  And a suite so that we can invite others to stay with us.  And the location is perfect:  10 minutes away from the airport, 10 minutes from two baseball fields (Phoenix Muni and Scottsdale), and two minutes from a major shopping center.\n\nAnd they finally got their internet to work.  \n\nSo I don't mind a few maintenance problems, no hair dryer in the bathroom, etc.  This'll do just fine."
4,"Delhi Palace has won my heart for Indian food.  There is a great lunch buffet that is well worth a drop in from time to time.  I'm not sure if this location is associated with the Delhi Palace on University, but I have been to both and liked both.  Sometimes Indian food buffets can feel not so fresh, but both of these restaurants keep things fresh and heated.  \n\nThis restaurant has my stamp of approval as my favorite Indian food in the Phoenix area."
2,Avoid the lunch buffet.  Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala.
0,"went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were."
1,"Decent. The dishes are somewhat bland and seem to be not quite as authentic as I have had in the past. The curry was ok and the tikka masala, well Ive had better. The buffet is above average and as always the Naan was wonderful!"
3,came here last Saturday night with a friend. the food is very good and you get a large portion - I had leftovers for lunch the next day. my only gripe is that the naan was a little more burnt/crispy than I like. I will be back to try their weekend buffet though.
0,"Really great staff - friendly and professional. But the facility is beat. Rugs stained, wanted to wear flip flops in my room. Towels scratchy. They need to raze it and start over."
4,"Red Devil has been around since before dirt was invented, and there is a reason: it is GOOD.\n\nI love love love their bruchetta.  It is, no hyperbole, the best in town.  I don't know where they get those tomatoes, but I have never tasted a bad one there.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nPizza=to die for.  Amazing.  The hubs and I usually split a white pie, and never regret it.... well, if you don't count the regret I feel that I over ate!\n\nWe have tried the entrees, but we always go back to the pizza.  It is really that good.\n\nGo to Red Devil - what have you been waiting for?  Have some bruschetta.  Go home full."
3,"Have been to red devil on a number of occasions and have enjoyed each visit. If you are not a fan of waiting for a table or waiting for a while on your food, don't stop by Friday nights. The place is packed. It you like white pizza, this place is worth the stop."
4,"I have lived at Riverwalk now for about 3 years in a purchased one bedroom condo that I am still in love with!  Its about time I wrote my raving review!! \n\nAbout the Condos: \n- Both one or two bedroom condos are very spacious\n- Very large balconies\n- Outdoor storage space on the balcony\n- Built in bookshelves\n- Large windows for lots of natural light\n- Tall ceilings\n- Large tub/ shower- perfect for relaxing bubble baths\n- 3rd floor condos have a wood burning fireplace\n- Nice large tiles in the kitchen and bathrooms\n- large dogs and other animals are allowed\n- gated complex\n- pool and hot tub\n- work out facility \n- covered parking spot and some garages available for extra $\n\nOverall the condos are wonderful! Most condos have been upgraded with granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathroom.  Also, most of the appliances have been updated to stainless steel.  In addition to the tiles in the kitchen and bathroom, most condos have either carpet or have been upgraded to wood flooring.  In all honesty when I was first looking at these condos they are similar to the neighboring complex, Red Rox.  However, Riverwalk has larger balconies and their exterior is painted a nice neutral white and tan, compared to Red Rox, which is a red and green color and always reminds me of christmas.      \n\nIn addition to the condos, I feel the location of these condos is fabulous! Located right on the border of Tempe and Phoenix; and Scottsdale is less than 5 minutes away.  Papago Park is right across the street for nice scenery, hiking and biking.  The Oakland A's baseball stadium is in walking distance for Spring Training games.  Also, the Phoenix Zoo is about a block away, next to the Botanical Gardens.  Right down the road is the Marquee Theater, the light rail, and Mill Ave.  Very easy to get anywhere you want to go from these condos!"
3,"Yay! Really great venue to get up close and personal to see any acts that you may like. Everything from jazz, to comedy, to hip-hop has been absolutely wonderful here. Not the classiest selection of snacks, and not the most scenic surroundings, but who cares? You are within shouting distance of the artist, that's pretty cool.\n\nThey recently dropped the fee for the parking, so yay for free parking too! All in all, a great venue."
0,"I came here years ago to see Henry Rollins Spoken word. (Totally awesome by the way: five stars.) The seats here though were absolutely HORRENDOUS! Now I'm 5'11\"" so I'm used to not having a lot of leg room so I'm used to sitting sideways so my knees aren't banging into the seat in from of me. Here, legs to the side and I'm still rammed up against the next row. It was like being in a three hour yoga pose. \n\nI have never before and never since seen rows of seats so close to eat other. Only my sister in law could sit comfortably and she's 5'1\"". Come on Celebrity Theatre, just a couple more inches. Size really does matter. If anyone told you otherwise, they were lying."
4,"I shattered the screen on my old Droid2, so I stopped by Sun Cellular on my way home from work. It was after 4:30 and the shop closes at 5. Even though Dan was still working on other phones, rather than turning me away, he said he could get mine done that day and stayed open past 5. There was a hard plastic band around the edge of my phone that was also cracked. Dan offered to replace it, free of charge, if he could take it from another phone. Unfortunately, that piece was more damaged on the phones he had, but it was awesome of him to offer!"
0,"I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. Several negatives affect this review:\n\n1. My car was broken into! This is a \""gated\"" community where the gate doesn't work half of the time!\n2. The apartment staff don't seem to care about their renters. Maintenance is a second thought, with little to no urgency. When asking about a piece of mail that was delivered to the office, they seemed to have no idea where it could have gone and keep no log of incoming or outgoing mail. On top of that, they didn't care enough to find the mail!\n3. Grounds are kept at a minimum. Dog bags are refilled occasionally, bushes are cut haphazardly. Overall, just unkempt.\n\nI'd say stay away from this place!!"
0,Massive sewer roach issue and I will scream it from the mountain tops until it is addressed. I fucking hate living here...They act like they're all over it but they're not.\n The staff fucks each other and the units are poorly maintained. They put a dog area right outside my apartment and people just bring their dogs to shit and piss...\n\nThe gate is constantly broken and there is no security here. When I'm in the pool at night I hear gunshots! When I asked about the shady online reviews at EVERY reputable online renters community/open forum my rental agent told me not to worry about it lmao!!!\n\nRENTER BEWARE!!!!! Please feel free to contact me before you consider renting here. \n\nI can't WAIT until this lease is up.
3,"This is by far the best BBQ place in Phoenix IMO.  The only problem that I always ran into is what to get.  All the meats are smoked to perfection and the link are spiced just the way i like it.\n\nThe BBQ sauce is so good that I keep a gallon of this wonder in my fridge at all times.\n\nOh, and they also have Alcohol!!"
2,Above average BBQ at a resonable price.  Large portions.
2,"This was a pretty decent place for good BBQ.  There isn't that much variety - mostly focused on BBQ meat sandwiches.  The good thing is that despite the small menu, what they do have is pretty good - I had the BBQ beef, which was tasty and had a ton of flavor."
1,"I feel bad giving them 2 stars, the first time I went I LOVED the bbq, so good, so tender.  Second time I went, same thing, BUT I got food poisoning!  A busy, well known place like that shouldn't have that happen.  I'm never eating there again."
2,Must have been an off day but still pretty good. Better luck next time!
3,"I've been going to this particular one since 1987.  It was a ritual to go there right after the Copper World race, Indy car race and  the races at Manzanita.  Great food, great portions and great atmosphere."
4,"Honey Bear's provided catering for our wedding last month and the food was unbelievably good! We had the barbeque chicken and pulled pork--both were out of this world. They delivered the food right on time as well, so that was one wedding detail we didn't have to stress over!  I would highly, highly recommend this joint to any and everyone! Thank you so much for making our backyard barbeque wedding dreams come true!"
1,I really wanted to like this place since I really dig family owned businesses I guess I will start my review by saying I ordered via phone but when I called I got an automated system that was horrible and didn't route you to anyone instead it said to call another number. After placing a huge order they said it would be done in 30 minutes. I went to pick up my order an hour later and it was still not ready and ended up waiting another 30 minutes when I looked around it seemed that everyone there was waiting for food and no food was being served in a timely matter. After finally getting my food I really wasn't impressed. \n\nPulled Pork-Dry\nBrisket-Dry\nSauce-Weak and needed spice\nBaked Beans-Very good especially with the sausage \nHot Links- Not bad but not spicy\nColeslaw- Very good \nCorn Bread- bland and tasted old
0,"I'm from Chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs, other than those that I BBQ myself. Everyone pointed me to Honey Bear's BBQ.\n\nThe place is clean and casual, and the service is OK. But the ribs were horrible. The beer was fantastic though and I first thought maybe the alcohol had dulled my taste buds. I remember screaming, \""Either this is a poor cut of beef/pork or both animals had mad cow/pig disease!\""\n\nI decided to return and give them another chance, and not order alcohol. I ordered the ribs and again, \""Mad Cow Disease!\""\n\nI won't ever return. How does that go: \""First time shame on you, second time shame on me...\"""
0,The food wasn't very tasty. The bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back.
3,"I have been to the Phoenix Zoo twice now. The first time was 3 weeks ago in 104 degree temp. Awful experience. We only went around the big animals side so my daughter could see them. All the animals were tired, hot and sleeping. They looked miserable and we were miserable too. The water mists did not help one bit.\n\nWe also went this past weekend when the temperature was a high of 76 degrees. Heaven!!! Loved the zoo. Had so much fun. No need to rush. We just relaxed. All the kids were in a great mood. People were smiling, laughing, just having plain ol fun. The animals seemed alive and active. Just a beautiful experience. The Arizona Trail is great. It might have been good to go there with the hot temperatures as well. Some animals are hard to see because of the layout in the cages. The cages are smaller than needed for some of these large cats and other wild life. The Orangutans have a little baby Orangutan in it and he just hangs and plays while the big guys sleep. It was really cool. My favorite part is the giraffes. There were 5 of them this last time."
2,"Nice typical zoo with all the usual animals with a few surprises and exceptions.\n\nThe \""reptile house\"" was a joke.  The prairie dogs...dayum...they're obese!  \n\nThe different themes throughout the zoo were cool.  And similar to the Toronto zoo, there are peacocks roaming freely and rabbits and quails too.  Oh my!\n\nI thought it was odd that none of the \""restaurants\"" at the zoo had any indoor dining rooms. \n\nIn addition, with one person in a wheelchair in our party, we thought it was ridiculous that the zoo wanted $35 for an electric wheelchair rental!!!  Are we renting a golf cart here?\n\nOther than the ridiculousness ,it was a nice big zoo to spend the day."
4,This zoo is amazing. I love that they have two splash zones. Please make sure to have your kids bring water appropriate clothes to play in. The barn and petting area is my daughters favorite place to check out!
0,"I am surprised to see other reviewers rate it anymore than an one. I would have given it a zero if it was an option.  We went to the zoo with my family, as we are visiting the Scottsdale area, plopping a hefty $45, expecting to be blown away. I am not well versed in zoo's other than as a mom of two young kids only to find an endless walk to see no animals. This zoo/park reminded me of a deserted zoo- could it be the time of year (Dec)- I don't think so.  Yelpers!! Take your money elsewhere. Did I happen to tell you that I asked for a refund and got a flat out NO REFUNDS. They offered tickets for another day but if I did not see any animals in the park why would I travel again for the same sub par experience?? The two supervisors listened with their Starbucks in hand and had a lot of reasons why our experience was terrible. Not exactly what I expect from a business."
2,It was a nice zoo but VERY small. And I mean extremely small. I've been to free zoos that have more to offer. You could walk through that zoo in 5 minutes if you continues through at a consistent pace. Not many animals and they missed out on some really cool animals. Not worth the price in my opinion.
2,"Now this is a true dive.  I believe the sign out front says that they open at 6a.m.  And no, they don't open that early to serve you scrambled eggs and coffee ;)  \n\nLadies, smart to walk with sharp side of your keys out when walking in the parking lot.  Better to wait for your friend (or date but that would be a very unromantic date) in the bar rather than sitting outside Wanderin.  \n\nThe name 'Wanderin' fits.... That is what it feels most of the patrons did ... literally  'wander in' to the bar.  Quite random... older crowd... heavy drinkers...  That is not to say very friendly... had a great debate on the correct recipe for a Moscow Mule with a gentleman down the bar.  No one won, since neither of us had cool phones with internet capabilities. This is not the place to order a cosmopolitan, wear patent leather pumps or sport that pseudo Louis Vuitton purse :)  \n\nI 100% agree with the other reviewer.. this is a MUST visit on any dive bar crawl."
1,ok food...def not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to... i paid $6 for a burrito and a soda..not expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks..
0,My cheese enchiladas had non-melted cheese in them. That's a basic prerequisite for enchiladas - melted cheese. Not impressed at all. This place is sophomoric at best. There are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on. If I could leave a half star I would. I will never eat here again.
1,"Don't go here if you have small children. This is a museum for 8 and up. If you are over 8 and have a love for fire engines and their history, then this place is great. This is not a place to go if you have young children that want to climb on everything. You are not even allowed to touch the railings that surround the fire trucks. The children's exhibit and the one firetruck that you are allowed to climb on seem like an afterthought.  Beware of the old men at the front as well, they don't seem too excited to have children there."
2,"Papago is a great place. Staff is accommodating and friendly. The location and scenery are great. One key problem, lack of posting for the appropriate tee off locations.\nPlease mark by colors at each tee off. Provide better signage for those of us who are new to this course. Please consider making these suggested changes. I would have given this course a higher rating of the signage was appropriate."
2,"Unfortunately, this place is on a downward trajectory it appears. Many businesses have closed and there are many vacancies. The ones that are there, apart from the Asian Market have changed hands. Not bad, but not worth a special trip."
4,"These guys are the best.  They know the products inside and out, and are kind, informative, and fair in everyway.  Take the guess work out of your repair, and let them do what they do best.  I have had many Mercedes, and do know them well, but these guys have so much experience, and knowledge, and I could not recommend a more trustworthy source then the great people at MB Motors.\nYou guys Rock!!!"
3,"If you like spicy food, this is one of the best places in Phoenix to find it.  I was taken here by some Taiwanese classmates, and enjoy every trip I make.  It's not conveniently located, but worth the trip.\n\nIf you can find a Chinese speaking/reading person to bring with you, you will be able to order some of the specials and things that are only written in Mandarin.  \n\nThere are two menus, the smaller menu with more Americanized fare, and the larger menu with more authentic Chinese cuisine.  If you are into the American side of things, their food is what you would expect."
0,"Reading the other reviews here makes me think I must have landed in a parallel universe the night we ate here. \n\nOK, so I'm a Bay Area native and love Sichuan food; I'm white and my girlfriend is Asian. We walk in the door, are seated, and handed the simple menu.  NOTHING of interest on the menu.  We decided on two very basic dishes (General Chou's Chicken and a Sichuan Prawm dish).  The Chicken was atrocious - dry, old-tasting, and nothing but a pile of chicken - no vegetables, no spice, nothing. The shrimp dish was marginally better, but nothing to write home about. \n\nMeanwhile, everyone at other tables seemed to be ordering stuff that we didn't see on the menu ... \""maybe there's a Chinese menu we didn't see\"" we said to each other ... \n\nOn our way out, we saw the 'Chinese' menu ... full of the stuff we were looking for - \""pigs stomach with jalapeno\"", etc .  So - I'm willing to believe they have good food, but - WHY oh WHY have a separate 'whites' menu? AND - when a white guy walks in with an Asian lady, WHY not give them the 'Asian' menu?  The 1 star accurately reflects the food we ate, and also applies to the waiter who did not think to offer us the appropriate menus. \n\nWe'll probably head back to Chandler for our next Chinese food experience."
2,"Decent food... if you want \""Sichuan/Szechwan\"" food you have to ask for the black menu. We noticed when Asians came into the restaurant they were only given the black menu, we had to ask for it. \n\nThat aside, the food was flavorful and tasty, but, even \""hot\"" dishes were far from hot, even though we asked for them to be very hot. \n\nDumplings were a bit over done and soggy. While I've not been to china, this wasn't on par with Sichuan places I've been to in NY and other major cities. I do really want to try their 'Hot Pots' so am looking forward to go back for that. \n\nService was swift and polite.   Knowing Mandarin Chinese or having a friend that knows it woudl help. \n\nSo if you take the Szechwan part out of it, I think it's a decent place to go for what I can only guess is Americanized Chinese food in general.\n\nThe water cooked chicken had a very interesting herbal spice to it and was very pleasant with other dishes on the table."
1,"Average to a little less than average.  Staff was rushed and left me to call them over to get our check.  Waitress then looked at her tip with me sitting there.  Didn't mind looking back at her while it seemed like she thought about asking for more.  \n\nFood is average Szechwan fare.  Hot and Sour Soup is spicier and good, but missing the sour part.  Dumplings were good quality and didn't skimp on meat.  However, their sauces were bland.  Almond Chicken is servicable... just skip noticing that they use peanuts instead of almonds and that there is barely 3 oz of chicken.  Rice was a tad dry.\n\nMeh..."
3,"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.  \nAs good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.\n \nOf all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    \n \nFor some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. \nAsian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.\n \nSide note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!\n \nSo I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy. \n \nWe all win."
3,"This is a restaurant I have been to umpteen times and thought of reviewing just now. Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant. Though admittedly, i havent experimented too much here, i have found what I love and stick to it. And that special list includes water boiled chicken, green beans with bacon, spinach with garlic, fish in black bean sauce. Order from the chinese menu, dont go with the cliche of kung pao chicken when all of these yummy dishes exist."
3,"Kungpao chicken is the best iv ever had!\n\nFood is great, they are fast, and friendly. \n\nI love this place!"
3,"For the price at lunch I am not sure you can get much better.  The food is good to great.  The price is cheaper then Panda Express and it blows that out of the water.  I love the Sweet and Sour, and the Kung Pau.  They give you soup and a salad with your meal as well."
0,Went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary. Ordered pig intestine stirfry but server talked me into boiled beef and fish. What a mistake!  Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.
0,"The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)"
3,"There are lots of great restaurants near Phoenix area, as a Chinese student, I would like to say the Szechwan palace can represent the authentic Chinese food.  I ordered Mopo Tofu, Chongqing Hotpot and Boiled beef and fish today. All dishes are really spicy and I really love it."
3,"You can get anything and everything you can get from Costco in behemoth size.  I usually wouldn't write about a chain, but this Costco has to be one of the better organized and there are an abundant amount of workers to help you out.  Be prepared to spend at least $100.  You think you only need a few things, but you keep adding up more.  On this particular occasion for whatever reason, I spent more than $400.  I was definitely packing it in for the winter hibernation.  Lastly, they have their food court indoors, which is essential considering your food or icre cream would wither away in the 110 degree heat."
2,The staff is nice .... Tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread
0,"I guess you could say I have been here 1.5 times.  This is the closest walk in clinic to my work place so I have ventured here out of convenience.  The first time was last summer and I just felt ill all over.  After a total of 3 hours here they did not know what was wrong with me but were going to treat me like I had strep throat. Three hours is not too long to wait if the lobby had been full but there were only about 3 others waiting with me and what seemed like an army of employees.  I was in the actual exam room for what seemed like 2.5 hours.  They were \""kind\"" enough to give me a blanket which looked like someone had vomited all over it and then it dried to a crusty finish.  The nurses kept coming in and checking on me; taking blood pressure  and temperature and demanded I take a pregnancy test.  I told them it was highly unlikely I was preggers (since I was not getting any but I felt they did not need to know all my extra cirricular activities or lack there of so I obliged them).  Finally they wrote me a prescription and I was on my way.   They never gave me the results of my pregnancy test but I was able to figure it out! \n\nSo, feeling ill and desperate I decided to give it one more chance yesterday but found myself disgusted as soon as I walked in.  There was a sign that read:  Due to technical difficulties we can not accept credit or debit cards.  Only cash or checks.  Well, I forgot my check book (since it's not 1987)  and don't carry cash so I asked the receptionist if I could put my name down and then run to the ATM about 2 blocks away.  She was at a loss for words but then basically told me no.  There were 8 people ahead of me!  I doubt they would get to the other 8 in the ten minutes it would take for me to go to the ATM.\n\nUpset and ill I remembered another clinic that I have been told is nice and I was on my way."
0,"I love the food, Karen is an excellent waitress, (the other one sucks) and I HATE THE SMOKE!  \n\nPay attention people!  Allowing smoke to drift into the building while people are eating is a VIOLATION.  I even asked the manager to put his cigarette out that he left burning in the ashtray and he just ignored me.  When I asked if they could at least shut the door while people were eating he said \""NO\"".  Sorry for ya, enjoy your fine!  \n\nPS, get a couple of new speakers for the crap radio station you play in there.  I know you can't hear too well but trust me, those have been blown for a couple years now!"
3,"I came to Souper Salad right after getting rejected by a closeby Quiznos that didn't accept my online coupon (a story I will write next).  I asked them if they had any specials, and they offered a coupon for free drinks with no questions asked.  I have been to Soupplantation/Sweet Tomatoes several times, so I was expecting something similar.  \n\nI first came to the salad bar, and I noticed that there were a lot of variety of vegetables and even meats.  At Sweet Tomatoes, you usually have to pay a little extra for chicken.  \n\nThe sides were pretty tasty too with 3 different kind of soups, pizza, pasta, and nachos.\n\nSo far 3 good points to the meal, and then comes the extras.  They had a cinnamon roll bread to die for.  It tasted especially good with a little ice cream on top.\n\nI will pleasantly happy after a bad experience from Quiznos."
1,"Cheap and low-quality\n\nA decent selection at a fair price, but the quality is far less than Sweet Tomatoes.  The salad bar wasn't kept fresh (wilted lettuce, low containers), the pizza was like a frozen type (crappy crust and sauce), greasy/oil atop of the meat for the tacos.  I won't go on.\n\nOn that note, it serves the purpose for a buffet - mass quantities for the masses.\n\nI will not go back.  I would prefer to spend $3-4 extra dollars to go to Sweet Tomatoes any day."
1,Good food\nFriendly service (only if they are not busy)\nI mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour
1,"We visited this Applebee's location last night.  We were out running errands, it was getting late, and this location is right around the corner from the house.  \n\nThe food is average for a chain.  You know what you're gonna get no matter what location you go to.  The service however is hit or miss...and last night the service missed the mark by a mile!\n\nOur waiter got to our table and asked for our drink order.  Good deal.  We order when he returns with our drinks.  \n  \nJ's order - Fajitas. \nMy order - Oriental Chicken Salad\nBaby C's order - Kids Meal Grilled chicken sandwich  (Kids Eat Free on Tuesdays)\n\nOur server, Michael,  runs off before I'm able to state..uhhh...the kids meal comes with a drink and side!!  We have to flag him down.  We state...we didn't have a chance to order the drink or side for our son.  He's like...oh i ordered him fries.  I'll have to go change it.  \n\nREALLY!?  I'm so sorry to inconvenience you!!  And I'm glad you think you know better than I do what I wanna feed MY CHILD!  Wow!  How perceptive of you...ya dumbazz!!  I order Baby C some steamed broccoli and a juice.  \n\nJ's and my food come out as ordered.  Baby C's is MIA.  A few minutes later his sandwich is brought out....with an applesauce.  Again I have to flag down the server so the correction can be made.  About 5 minutes later we get a side of over steamed broccoli...but whatever.  Baby C doesn't seem to mind.  \n\nDrinks...he's on the ball with refills of my water.  But misses the mark with J's root beer refill.  He brings him Dr. Pepper instead.  And then when J says...hey this is Dr. Pepper, not Root Beer.  The server is like..you ordered Dr. Pepper though, right?  WRONG!  \n\nThen we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.  It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.  The one right next to us didn't seem happy either with the service.  In fact they seemed pretty pissed.  \n\nI sure hope we get a different server if and when we ever return."
1,"No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok, but nothing very impressive and definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.  We sent back the Fish and Chips and it took a pretty long time to get the replacement meal we requested.  Not planning on returning ever again.  Service was quick, except for the replacement meal taking forever."
0,"I just came back from visiting this location and I have to say the experience was just terrible. I've been to this location like three or four times but this time the experience was just awful. The waiter was not friendly, did not smile once, and she was not attentive whatsoever. I myself have worked in the restaurant industry and know how stressful and chaotic it can be but she did not even ask us if we were okay. We ordered the appetizer trio and our entrees after. It took 45 minutes for our food to get to the table, not once in that time did she ask if we were okay or that our food was almost out, no service whatsoever. We ended up gettiny our food, which was cold by the way, and never even got the appetizer we ordered. I was so upset with this visit, the manager was great and took care of the bill, I left hungry and upset. I'm not one of those people to take the time to write reviews everywhere I dine at, but this experience was just horrible."
1,"A very odd experience.  \n\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.  \n\nOnce you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \n\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \n\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.  Our server was nice and attentive.  \n\nThe entire time we were there, I was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about."
0,"Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"
0,Since zero stars is not an option 1 shall do. \n\nOne of the worst dinning experiences EVER!\nMe and my party of 4 sat down on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after the PRIDE festival just down the road. We sat and enjoyed the free chips and salsa and nothing else. After 25 minutes and ZERO service of a beverage or even an acknowledgement of our being there we decided to leave. \nIf the place had been busy that would have been different but we were 1 of maybe 5 tables being used. \nSad sad restaurant. \nNever again.
2,"Good place.  Friendly staff.  It has a nice little bar with a few TV's to watch the game, which is a lot to ask in Midtown Phoenix. :)"
0,"Think twice before ordering online or by phone from this florist.\n\nI ordered a $185 \""European Basket\"" to be sent to a friend.  What was shown on their website was truly beautiful.  What arrived didn't even remotely resemble the photo.  I realize that florists reserve the right to make changes in an arrangement based upon availability,etc.  However, we are not talking about that here.  The entire arrangement was different.  As if someone got 2 orders mixed up and my recipient ended up with the ugly one.\nIt would not have been difficult for Cactus Flowers to pick up the phone and let me know that what I ordered was something that they were not able to produce presently.  And then worked with me to find a satisfying solution.  Instead I am left feeling like I was taken by this company, and my friend has received an ugly arrangement that I did not order, should NEVER have been charged $185 for, and am embarrassed to even have my name attached to it.\nBased on my experience, I will never do business with Cactus Flowers again.  If you have no option but them, think long and hard about doing internet or phone orders.   There are plenty of other florists in the valley that deserve the business."
3,"Stayed here when I traveled for work about a month ago. \n\nWhat I liked:\n-Really liked the room; bed, separate room for sofa, tv, and mini fridge\n-free Internet in my room\n-great rate for a weeknight, just around $100\n-hotel had a cool interior, open floors, but not loud where you could hear chatter.\n\nWhy no fifth star:\n-parking garage is really confusing to navigate\n-breakfast was a bit expensive, get the buffet, not the menu items.\n\nWould come back here since it's close to work and good value for a Hilton."
1,So disappointed.  My husband and I decided to have a little stay-cation because I am 8 months pregnant with twins.  Upon a riving to the hotel we were under the impression we would be greeted by vallet. Surely one of the great hilton hotels would have someone to park cars on a busy Saturday afternoon.  NO there was no one outside. Secondly the front desk gal was very friendly.  Good greeting she educated me on the package my husband had bought as I checked us in while he was parking the car. After I checkled in  I looked for someone to help me with our bags. Again no one there to help. So With a luggage cart in hand I found the elivator....ok so now you are telling me there is not even someone to help me get this thing to the 8th floor . When I got to the room they key card  that i was given didn't even unlock the door. So that meant toting the same bulky luggage cart back to the elevator back down stairs though the lobby. While 8 months pregnant mind u. I had it. I called my husband he came up to the room and went down stairs to get a new card. I checked out the room nothing extraordinary.  But I was jus ready to relax except I found old french fries in the couch and a dead fly on the bed....we will not be returning to the hilton.  For 200$. This has been a craptastic experience.  I really wish I had jus booked a room at the Sheraton or the local holiday inn.
1,"Don't Do Online Ordering!\n\nTypically, I really like the food from STNY. Today was my first time ordering from them online - but it will definitely be my last!\n\nI'm no novice at online ordering - I buy lots of stuff online, including local pizza delivery. Wanting something, different, I visit the STNY website, see they have online ordering - cool! So, I create my account, place my order, pay online, get my email confirmation... a few minutes later, one of their employees calls and says, \""Yeah, we don't know why but you got two free toppings on this pizza. We're gonna go ahead with it this time but in the future we're gonna have to charge you extra.\"" \n\nUm, WTF?! All I did was click the buttons to indicate what kind of pizza I wanted, the toppings, followed their prompts for payment including adding a tip (even though that was confusing to do). If there's a problem in the way their system calculates out my total, it is CLEARLY a problem with their programming NOT with me the customer! She seriously made me feel like I was trying to get away with something... how could I \""sneak\"" in a couple of extra toppings on their system?! Do they not even think things through before calling their customers with accusations?\n\nThey just lost my business. NOT COOL!"
3,"I've yet to try Pizzeria Bianco (one of these days!) but as this place shares the same owner, I found that grabbing a sandwich here is much less of a hassle than waiting in line for a pizza at PB.   Never thought twice about making the trip out from Peoria for lunch, either.\n\nThe word is that the owner is very fastidious when it comes to food thus he only uses fresh, local ingredients--often from his own garden.  Taste one of the sandwiches to find out for yourself!\n\nSeriously though, how many places can you go where the owner is the one responsible for baking the bread for YOUR sandwich?  Not many.  But here he will.  So what if I was a tad celeb-struck, at least I didn't embarrass myself by waving and shouting at him.  Meh, he's probably used to it."
3,"I now know where the hipsters are in Phoenix. \nAn easy ordering menu like In-N-Out, but with fresh rustic sandwiches.  \nOnly four different sandwiches, four different salads, and a small variety of sodas in a bottle makes life easy to decide.    \nI liked the quick service, the banter between the staff and regulars, and bench seating.  \nI don't like that it's only open for lunch on the weekdays.\nWhatever they are doing though, they are doing it right, because I think about eating there a lot and their other restaurant Pizzeria Bianco."
2,"Ok here's the deal. I went to pizzeria bianco this past week and bar bianco, so when we headed out to try Lux this morning, I figured, why not wait around and try Pane Bianco too. So that's what the BF and I did. Right when the restaurant opened I went in intending to only order one sandwich for the BF and I to share, but once inside, I saw they had a special focaccia and decided to get that too so we could have a more broad idea of what the food is like at this place. Both the sandwich and focaccia had mozz, basil, and tomato. So I went up and ordered and the man taking the orders was less than super friendly, but I can understand that for a place trying to be fast that is also super busy. Then I stepped to the side to pay with some other guy, who was actually pretty nice. After that, you have to sit around and wait for your food.... this is kind of awkward because the space is very small and warm and there are products all around so no matter where I stood I felt like I was in someone's way. Finally, they called my name and I got a little paper bag with my food in it and went to sit outside. The BF and I started by splitting the sandwich. Ok, so the sandwich was alright, I liked how the ingredients tasted fresh and the bread was very good, but it really could use something to make it a little more interesting. If they were to drizzle a little bit of aged balsamic on the sandwich, it would be delicious and I would want to come back for it all the time. As is.... I thought it was a little boring and would be kind of easy to make at home, so why would I come here for it? So after we finished that, we moved on to the focaccia. \n\nNow this was a different story. The focaccia was really good. It's like a corner slice of a square pizza almost. It had the same ingredients as the sandwich, but somehow tasted way better. I guess it's the melted cheese, the type of bread, and the fact that there was clearly olive oil on it that helped it be so much more flavorful. This was close to as good as the pizza was that we got at pizzeria bianco the other day. So, that made me happy and it only cost $4.50, so that made me even happier. I would be much more likely to come here than to wait three hours for the other. \n\nSo why does this place get 3 stars and the other get 4? I thought the selection here was very limited, which is fine if it helps them put out more quality food, but man, there's not a lot of choice. Also, the service was much better at the pizzeria. Finally, the appetizers at the pizzeria were freakin amazing and nothing I got today was amazing. HOWEVER I would probably come here again before going back to the pizzeria due to wait time.\n\nPS I didn't get a sweet! Now I feel sad. :-("
2,"Totally expect to get my ass kicked by the serious Pane Bianco devotees on here, but oh well. Meh. I don't like paying $10+ for a sandwich, and then almost $4 for a side, and $2-3 for a bottle of water/bottle of soda. That is not an acceptable lunch option to me. Especially when I have yet to patron Pane Bianco one time and not been hungry an hour later. This is the freakin' sushi bar of the sandwich world.\n\nWhile I'll agree that the ingredients are fresh, you get so few of them it would be difficult to know otherwise. I've been several times now and pretty much always get the tomato/mozz sandwich as I don't eat tuna salad or have a taste for sopressatta. The other day however I got the market sandwich and I was so excited to be able to try something new because it had turkey in it. 2 whole super thin supermarket looking slices of turkey. Mmmmmm. Delicious giant pieces of bread with two super thin slices of turkey in the middle. How could I say anything nasty about paying $10 for you? How dare I be hungry an hour later when you made me so full with all of that bread? You get the picture. Stick the the tomato/mozz sandwich if you're heading this way. Oh, and make sure someone else is picking up this ludicrous tab."
4,"Always a great meal, tomato moz sandwich amazing, focia pizza amazing"
3,Super cute spot with the freshest of the fresh ingredients. Tasty sandwiches and salads. Fast and friendly service. Adorable country farm feel. What's not to love?
1,"I used to be a huge huge fan of this place.  But, recently they seem to have quality control issues.  One issue has been the bread---which used to be nothing short of awesome.  One a couple of recent visits (off the lunch time rush) the bread tasted like it had been sitting around (in one case, the sandwich was inedible).  A second issue has been seasoning, which used to be perfect.  In one case, the sandwich lacked any taste and in another case, the moz was unevenly salted.  All of these are \""sins\"" that are excusable from an ordinary sandwich shop with ordinary prices.  (Well, the inedible sandwich isn't excusable...)  But, I expect much better from PB."
0,"I've never eaten here, just had a friend describe to me how he was kicked out for \""speaking spanish\"".  A bit in shock that a business in America thinks this is helpful in anyway.  If it's true then I suggest nobody eat here but Separatist douchebags."
2,"minus a star for not having an EPL ticket to show all the games. for F###'s sake you are THE english bar in phoenix and I can't watch my beloved gunners unless they are on ch 167?? come on.  \nIf you are going to hang the flags and scarfs at least have the game, when its 7am and i want to get pissed watching arsenal-chelsea in the '5th' biggest city in the US and I cant, well, it doesn't make daddy happy. haha\nall in all not a bad place\ngreat beer selection\nnice decor, simply put, its one of those places where you get some drinks in for 2-3 hours, walk out and say \""holy sh!t, the sun is still out????\"""
2,"The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only."
3,"Enjoyed the fish and chips. The fish flaky, thick cut, with a thin crispy batter. The chips... a little to soft. Overall pretty good. Looks like a great place to catch a soccer game. English style food."
2,"I have been here a couple times and generally enjoy it. The parking is not the best and it's a dark lit area. They have decent beer selection, the food is hit or miss. I have had the fish & chips 2 times and it was good but the coleslaw that came with it was horrible. The other times I had just a pub burger and it was nothing special. I've been able to catch a few of the bagpipe acts here and it's cool to see. They have darts and a pool table. Overall it's a cool place to come have a drink."
0,"Been meaning to try this place for years and finally had an opportunity. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best. \n\nHaving lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the \""taste of England\"" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better. \n\nI guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...). \n\nP.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips, although I wouldn't be surprised."

0,"Horrible service, horrible attitudes. I created a yelp account to write this review. Absolutely rude and incredibly expensive."
0,"I have been looking for a pair of mid century lamps for my living room, and several people suggested I stop into Modern Lighting.  I went in on a Saturday morning and found a beautiful pair of lamps.  To my dismay, the owner was downright rude and unprofessional.  He quoted me $200/each, and then several minutes later when I was asking again, the price had jumped to $250/each (I brought 2 girlfriends in with me who overheard this discrepancy).  \n\nWhen she head the jump in price, my friend proclaimed \""I think that's too high for those lamps,\"" and suddenly we were persona non grata at this shop. It was as if the owner's split personality came out at that moment, because he bristled at her comment, refused to look at me or speak  directly to me and told us the lamps were no longer available and had been \""sold\"" (funny, because they were for sale 30 seconds prior). I asked about another lamp that I had been considering and he said it was also no longer available (ie: get the hell out of my store). \n\nHe then strode to the front of the shop, opened the door and basically pushed us out of his shop.\n\nI was SHOCKED to be treated like this:\na) because I was genuinely considering buying those lamps\nb) because my friend was simply telling me she thought the price was high, and it wasn't even MY comment that irked the proprietor \nc) because he so clearly lied about pricing, quoting me two very different prices within a few minutes.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back."
3,"I decided to try the Bikram Yoga Studio in Phoenix and I have to say I am very happy with it.  This location is very conveniently located in Uptown Plaza next to AJ's.  Right off the light rail too.   I've been going for about a month now. My first class was with MJ who I think is awesome!  In fact all the instructors I've had, while all different, are pretty good in their own way.  They are great about keeping to the dialog and explaining the postures, and their benefits. They make sure to keep you reaching for more and I have noticed a major improvement in myself. \n\nThe studio is a good size but I will say I would prefer more studio space and less lobby space since the classes can be pretty large at times.  It's not a deal breaker by any means.   I think the cleanliness is pretty good.  I know past reviews have said it's not which makes me think they may have done something to improve because I don't feel it's bad at all.  But this is a Bikram studio, so not sure what people are expecting. People are sweating non stop all day in there.  For that alone, it's amazing how clean it is. \n\nI like that they supply a cleaner & towels to clean your mat after class.  This is handy and probably helps them make sure the class will have clean mats attending.\n\nThe men's locker room (which is all I can review) is actually very nice.  It's clean, a good size and it has nice cubes for your belongings.\n\nIf I had one compliant it wouldn't really be about the studio itself, but more about some of the new people attending.  I wish they would give the new students upon signing up, a run down of Bikram etiquette.  I have heard far too many people chatting in the studio before the instructor comes in.  Many students use the time before class to quietly meditate and center themselves as they prepare for class. With Groupons coming out, there tend to be a lot of \""first timers\"" so it's important they know the etiquette before they enter the room.  Also leaving the room should be for emergencies only.  We are all dizzy and want to vomit, get past it!  Once a girl walked into class well into our second set of breathing exercises.  That was a little shocking since in most studios that is a huge No No!   When the class starts if you are late...No class for you.   \n\nIt's a great feeling and I am glad I have found something I really enjoy doing.  I am always looking forward to my next class!"
3,"Went for Sunday brunch (around noon) and were all pleasantly surprised!  \n\nThe service was great -- you get your own pitcher of water and carafe of coffee.  The coffee was deeeelicious.  \n\nI made the mistake of ordering a tall stack of pancakes.  They were HUGE.  Honestly, all you need is a short stack -- they were at least 8 inches across.  The sausage were slightly overcooked, but still really good.\n\nAnother in our group had an omelette and we weren't overly impressed with it -- she commented she could have gotten a bigger omelette at IHOP (and probably better looking).  \n\nBut overall, I'd go back.  Those pancakes were delicious, as was the coffee.  Very good."
4,"Finally, a chic and affordable Aveda salon in downtown Phoenix. Hooray! I love this place. The ladies at the front desk are SO warm and inviting - they're the kind of people who would make you forget all about your bad day. I trust Lilly with my waxes - she is friendly and very knowledgeable. I was scared for my first wax and asked her about a million questions, all of which she answered thoroughly and with patience. I haven't had a haircut here yet, but definitely plan on it."
4,"Loooove Ide Mania! I go there mostly for waxing since I'm terrible about getting my hair cut, but I always see those getting their hair done smiling and laughing and their hair looks great. I'll be going there for this soon. \n\nAs for the waxing... Lily is AH-MAY-ZING! She's so sweet and fun, and she does the best job on waxing that I've ever had! They're quick to make appointments to fit your busy schedule and the ladies working are so friendly! You're missing out if you haven't been here yet! :) \n\nPS - Their prices are also great! Better than any other salon I've been to WITH better service and results."
4,"Great place. As one reviewer said this is NOT a meat-market. Smart trainers, great use of space and allow you to get in and get out quick with 30 minute workouts. The trainers here don't rely on machine circuits like many other gyms. At Vitality you are using dumbbells, kettlebells, TRX, barbells, medicine balls and even flipping tires or hitting the heavybag. The owner is incredibly nice, and make sure to ask for Liz if you want a trainer who is high energy and will kick your butt!"
2,"Ahhhh, yes. Every woman just loves the Crotch Doctor. I am no exception. There's nothing like spreading eagle in front of somebody you just met, who may or may not know what \""gentle fingers\"" really means. (Uhm, yeah right.)\n\nAlas, the search for a great M.D. or OBGYN is one of those exasperating yet essential quests in every woman's life. \n\nSo, imagine my disdain when - newly located to Phx - I had to strike out to find a female MD I didn't want to strangle. \n\nLuckily, luck was on my side. \n\nAfter searching for who was covered by my insurance (on their handy-dandy Web site), I found this place - Central Phoenix Women's Health Care Center - and was introduced to Dr. Susan Morton-Pradhan. \n\nI had no idea what to expect. It's like calling a salon and hearing the name of somebody you never met, who could royally f*ck up your hair. But, there's only one way to find out...\n\nThe Center itself is located in a 3-store office-type building on the South side of Osborn, just shy of Central. You are welcomed by grey walls, stale carpeting, a dingy elevator you fear is going to malfunction at any given moment. Yikes. The Center staff is terse, unwelcoming and standoffish. They seem a tad disorganized, having thought my appointment was for something else and demanded I pee in a cup, just after I had rushed to \""empty the pipeline.\"" So, I had to drink 17.5 of their half-sized cups of water-cooler water, trying to entice an encore. That's when they ushered me back through the waiting area and said, \""Oh, we don't need a sample... But you can give us one if you want.\"" D'oh! \n\nOh, whatever; they do their job. You fill out paper. You sign-in. You wait. You get weighed. You know, the usual. I can deal with shitty staff, so long as my Doctor is the Patron Saint of Gyno.\n\nNow that Dr. Susan Morton-Pradhan has gone to another place, I can review this Center for what it is: A place for women to go when they need their annual screenings, as well as when there happens to be a bun in the oven. (Oops, how did that happen?) \n\nLucky for me, I have no reason to go back, considering my Doctor relocated and, by god!, I'm following her. She's the best Crotch Doctor I've ever had!"
0,"I have no hesitation in giving this review one star.  I wanted a Frosty, but left without anything.  The patron two cars in front of me apparently thought she was ordering at a fine dining establishment.  It's Wendys not a fancy steakhouse. While waiting for this person to finish ordering her lenghtly and detailed order, a bum tried to ask me for change.  I promptly told him to get the F*** out of here.  I took my own advice and did the same.  Will not be back to this location."
1,I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.
1,"Parking! Parking! Parking! What a nightmare! I have never found a spot inside their parking area. I always park at the Wendys across the street and walk over. As for the service I can't complain, they have always helped me out and been very nice. It does however take me awhile to get an appointment. Usually ranges between 7-10 business days. I have also never had anyone at my clinic ever pick up the phone. I have always left a message and they return it within 24-48 hours."
1,"10/23/13\n\nAt the VA facility today for long awaited appointments. Prior to departing I had the opportunity to visit the travel office. At the travel office I picked up a number(69) from the ticket machine, they overhead counter read 29!\nIf this wasn't bad enough, two windows were open and one employee occupying the right window was actually sitting down at the service counter reading a NEWSPAPER, while literally dozens of vets were waiting patiently to be seen.  Are these the kind of employees the Phoenix VA have as support staff? God help us all."
0,Worst customer service ever!  Completely disgusted with the service received at this VA hospital...Operators blind transfer you to other departments that hang up on you...First time registering?  Expect to be put on a 3 to 6 month waiting list just to talk to someone to set up an appointment no matter how bad you need to see a DR..\n\nVeterans DESERVE better than this!!
0,"I am leaving my previous review below, but I subsequently had a terrible experience here.\n\nI needed a new car headlight, and they screwed it up and fried my car.  It took three employees hours to get the headlight changed, and in the process of troubleshooting the damage that their sausage fingers had done in the engine, took out some fuse box thing and put it back upside down.  At that point nothing electronic in my car worked, and the car itself wouldn't start the next day.  A competent mechanic fixed it, but it cost me a significant amount of money and time in towing and mechanic fees.  Autozone was not interested in reimbursing me for the damage they had caused.\n\nOld review:\nI just got home from having a new battery put in my car, and I was super happy with my new favorite car store!  \n\nI am incompetent at cars, so I went in saying I thought my battery might be mostly dead.  It was.  Car stuff's expensive.  I'll forgive them.  The Autozone kid was super helpful though.  He spent a good half hour inside car, removing the old battery (my car is the \""labor intensive\"" kind of battery holder) and gouging out all the corrosion I had let accumulate.  A half an hour!  He could have easily just told me to do it myself.  \n\nMany a restaurant or retailer could learn from the Autozone business model.  Good service is awesome."
3,i love this applebee's !!!! everyone is super friendly!  for dessert i recommend getting the blondie! so yummy
1,"These type of chain places are noy my jam- It was OK- they do have some pretty awesome Happy Hour Specials on drinks and food- that being said, i would come back, but only for those deals and only with girlfriends for dinner and drinks during HH- otherwise, you are getting crap."

1,"Stopped in here a few months back.  Walking into the store it is very bright with florescent lights that made me feel like I was in an episode of twilight zone.  Not that I need to feel like I am at a 5 star resort but the lighting in here is jarring.\n\nThe staff was a little to eager.  One woman followed me around and kept trying to offer helpful suggestions \""all you have to do is ask\""....Uh thanks but I think I got this all figured out.  Tried to make as little eye contact on checkout and the cashier kept saying creapy shit like \""well I know you'll be back\"".  \n\nDo people walk into adult stores and ask for help and recommendations?  Ekk.  Everything sold here can be supplied with the same general directions: 1) Insert 2) Turn on 3) enjoy.  No need for creepy chit-chat.  Just let me pay for my items and skeddadle."
4,"Hands down, this place has the BEST sandwiches in AZ!\n\n1. Great Bread\n2. Generous size portion of meat in each sandwich.\n3. Nice variety of sandwiches.\n\nWild Turkey is my personal favorite sandwich.\nBrie/ Boar's Head Turkey/ Lettuce/ Tomato on Sourdough Bread."
1,"All I can say is, I really hope this place was having a bad day. I was really hoping this place would be good. I loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go...but I guess not.\n\nWhen you first walk in, there is no real clear direction as to where you go to order. I walked up to where they were making sandwiches for another customer and stood there. There were two people behind the counter making sandwiches. One left to ring a customer up and came back. All along, for the 5 minutes I was standing there, nobody said \""we'll be right with you\"", \""Hello\"", nothing. I didn't even get eye contact, but I suppose that would have meant they would have had to say something.\n\nI finally got an \""Are you ready?\"", which as a side note I thought was somewhat rude. You can't even give me a \""Hello. How may I help you?\"" Just an \""Are you ready?\"" as if I had been making him wait a long time before making my decision. No... I was waiting on you. But I digress. I ordered and decided to get my sandwich to go because the environment wasn't much to look at and it felt claustrophobic.\n\nThe food meh and made with what seemed like bagged bread. You can look at my photos to see what I got. I think they speak for themselves."
4,This is my favorite deli in the valley.  Whenever I am in central Phoenix I work my schedule around making sure that I get to eat here.  They remember my name and ask about how my family is doing even when it's been months since my last visit.  The fact that you can see pictures of generations of family working behind the counter in one place really should mean something when trying to figure out why you should eat here instead of subway or some other massive chain.  I always get the new yorker.  This is the place everyone craves in their community for lunch and it exists!
1,I always hear hype about China Chili...now I've been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about.  Unfortunately I never made it there prior to the big move but I really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness.  My vote still goes to GHoHK.
0,"They do not use fresh ingredients, or at least they cook so badly to make it seem that way.\n\nPeople must have to convince themselves that this place is good because it's the trendy thing to do. But you're better off going elsewhere if you want good Chinese food.\n\nHere's a general tip for you guys: if the place isn't predominantly Asian, leave. That's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par. But if you're white and have never had genuine southern Chinese food, you'll probably just barely choke down your \""food\"" and agree with most people that this place is decent."
3,The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well.
3,"Wanting to go to a Chinese restaurant that wasn't a buffet, I stopped by China Chili in Central Phoenix. The inside is a vast room filled with beautiful chandelier lighting and stunning Chinese artwork. Looked pretty fancy for the price, so it's a good choice to take someone special with the apperance you have money. I asked for a small table in the back corner to eat in peace among the sparse group of younger and older people present. \n\nMenu was quite large, with a deep selection of various choices. I was feeling seafood tonight, so I went with the Kung Pao Calamari which according to the menu is spicy and hot. Faster than I could say Toa chie, the dish arrived. No joke, the server walked into the kitchen and the food came out in about 2 minutes. That's insane and impressive. \n\nThe Kung Pao Calamari in presentation was great and looked delicious on the oval plate. Red, green bell peppers, cucumbers, peanuts and of course the calamari. Scooped up some calamari with various bits of vegetables and upon first impression it was quite good, although the calamari was fairly rubbery more than what I'm used to. The chewing went on longer than I was hoping. Good nonetheless and acceptable. Portion of food was more than adequate with a side of rice as is customary. I did not sense any spiciness to the food which I found disappointing as I do love a little kick in my seafood. I'd honestly like to try something else next time I come here. I sense the potential here.\n\nOverall, China Chili for the price and the atmosphere it's worth it. I would actually rate this place if I was able, close to 3 and half stars as the food wasn't as dynamic as the more upscale authentic places I've been to but then again I didn't expect that either. If you want Chinese food that has a little more class that doesn't kill your paycheck check out China Chili."
3,It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!
0,"oh no no no no!  i ordered the tofu and um, well, it was silken tofu.  i would figure that they would know which tofu to use and how to cook it but i was so unhappy with my meal.  i will never return and i would just like to forget about the whole thing."
4,The orange chicken and house rice were perfect together.  We added in a pork dish and it was a great combo.  They seated us quickly and had our drinks out right away.  The server checked on us consistently but wasn't annoying!
3,"I've never been to a \""bad\"" JJ before - the locations I've ever visited (LA, San Diego, Seattle, Phoenix) have all been consistent and obviously very standardized. So, round-of-applause for that!\n\nWent to the downtown location yesterday for lunch and was waiting *patiently* behind a lady who took the menu WAYYYYYY too seriously. Damn woman! It should not take 3-4 minutes to decide what smoothie you want? Should it? Or am I just an ass??\n\nWell, anyways - the personnel noted this and started interacting w/the line (of 4 ppl) and started to get the smoothie making party started. Great job!!! But, sadly - I was not asked what free power boost I wanted in mine. I really needed extra protein yesterday so boooo! Regardless, the smoothie was fantastic - had the Light Mango-A-Go-Go."
1,"Jamba Juice. Here is a company whose stock cost me a pretty penny on the market a couple years ago.  Even though this company stock burned me I still come in from time to time to relive the glory days when Jamba was opening up a few new stores around the country every week. The menu has gotten a whole lot bigger since then but it was nice to see they still have a lot of the classics. I found it interesting how similar some of the smoothies taste from menu to menu, but as the prices went up the ingredients became much healthier. I wish I could remember the two smoothies that I am referring to specifically but oh well...\n\nI am giving this Jamba Juice two stars because it is a great representation of why this company will never be great. There is a huge lack in management here. The employees are all super causal and in no way embody Jamba Juice's company character of being a healthy, intelligent and delicious choice. In my experience the employees here have not necessarily been rude, but just unpleasant. The pleasantries go a long way with costumer satisfaction. I have already mentioned how I feel about the smoothie menu above and now its time to tackle the baked goods. Wow. These are just plan bad. The baked goods section is full of wraps, pretzels, etc. that are all pre made from corporate just waiting to be heated up as the costumer come in. Clearly a huge smudge on image of Jamba being a healthy alternative."
0,I just paid $20 for two drinks.  This place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous.  The kale isn't fresh it's frozen. The drinks are good but not worth the price. Just juice at home or go to a neighborhood market.

4,"Now that I'm living back in Central PHX I got a membership once again at Movies On Central. \n\nI love their selection and I can usually find that odd arty flick here that most other video stores don't carry. Just like this weekend I was searching for \""Ladies and Gentleman Introducing The Fabulous Stains\"" starring a teenage Diane Lane and Movies on Central had it! \n\nI like how they have a cult movie section and section off movies by director.\n\nIf you are a movie buff this store is for you."
1,Used to be a serviceable record store but has become a shell of its former self.  OVERPRICED lps and the selection is almost the same as it was 10 years ago.  I am an avid collector and really find no reason to go here anymore.
1,"Came here for a couple of rounds after dinner--it was early like 7ish and the place was pretty empty, but it was nice because my group was able to play a few rounds of pool without being bothered.\n\nIt's a dive/biker place-- but sometimes that's all you need cheap beer and good juke box music. \n\nI didn't notice a \""smell' at all, i thought the place was pretty clean.  And the staff is really nice and tentative....so plus!\n\nWe were of the few \""younger\"" ppl here, i think maybe like five others who were in our age group(20's) were in attendance.  Mostly locals probably, but that was cool, fun couple of hours."
4,"Hanrattys is my go to dive bar. You cannot beat 2.50 bud and bud light drafts. Plus it is also an Ohio bar which I can enjoy. Not much of a crowd but it is a fun place to relax. \n\nThey have real darts and pool tables. So there is plenty to do. \n\nThe only downside, is the food. I have only tried one thing and that is the mozzarela sticks so do not try them."
4,"All I can say is YUM!  This is my new favorite place.  Not only can you build your own salad, but the premade ones they prepare are excellent too!  The broccoli salad is a must try, and the won ton chicken happiness salad.  I've already been 3 times since I first went a week and a half ago and still haven't made it to the soups, but the selection is great and they all look amazing!  I will try next time and report back.  Also, the lemonade mixed with the strawberry lemonade is soooo good!  I could go on forever... eat at Sweet Tomatoes!!!"
3,"Being on a No Meat Diet makes you think outside the box sometimes when your accustomed to being an omnivore.....so, when we were looking around for a place to grab some lunch a friend suggested we stop by Sweet Tomatoes.  It has been over 10 yrs since I've been to one, so I thought why not.\n\nWe arrived just before the lunch rush at 11:30 am.  There was a short line, but nothing crazy.  I piled a bunch of Salad and Pasta Salad on my plate and then made the rounds over to the Bread section.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=jRysLhaB-0yg5Wa2EYYQsw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=L3xqRAzbnoT7e2khkOUW6w\nThe food was very good, tasty and satisfying.  I went back to grab a small bowl of Mac n Cheese too, which was ok.\n\nI had a coupon for 2 for $9.99, so it was a great deal.  Overall, the meal was perfect and I left full.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
0,"I have noticed the trend in all the location but today was the worst.  Coffee was cold and the cream was warm.  The lettuce had a faint smell of bleach or ?  There was almost no breads out but a few drier ones.  I took one and it was cold and soggy.  No one cleared my table or even spoke to me though there were people doing that at other tables.  The frozen desert, chocolate, had no taste at all.  It was cold, creamy and without any flavoring.  The lady at the registered dropped 2 large stacks of glasses (all glasses are plastic or paper).  She and others picked them up from the floor and stacked them back up.  I watched as they gave them to the new customers.  What do you think would be on a floor? There is always lots of food but they obviously care nothing about food temperatures or bacteria on their dishes. I will not be returning."
3,Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out.
2,"All About Books & Comics is like philosophy and Phil Collins' post-Genesis contributions to music; I know I'm supposed to give a shit, but I don't. Try as I may, I just can't get excited about it. \n\nAAB&C has everything a good comic store should have; in-depth yet intuitive store lay-out, boxes upon boxes of back issues, nice tidy displays of action figures and busts, a big sign on the front of the store  professing their accolades...\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nThere's no playing or reading space of any kind. No television. The radio usually plays smooth jazz or some other music substitute.\n\nAnd unless you're willing to strike up a conversation with the guy in the Amoeba Music t-shirt who so looks like he's already judged your worth as a person by the time you've made it to the graphic novels section, there's really no one to strike up any conversation with. Unless you need help looking for something (here's a hint...alphabetization).\n\nYes, AAB&C is a good \""comic book store\""...by standards set ten or twenty years ago. These days I expect more from my comic book store. \n\nMaybe it's because of the integration of trading card players into geek culture. Or maybe it's because the internet has replaced basic human interaction and I crave more face to face time with other nerds like myself. \n\nOr maybe it's because it's 114 fucking degrees outside and I need a place to go.\n\nBut me personally, I like a comic book store with some atmosphere and hospitality.\n\nSure, not having any playing space to play or read cuts back on the \""Yeah, I think I can get it one more game in before my mom comes to pick me up\"" crowd, but let's call a spade a spade; you used to be that fucking kid. And so did I. \n\nMaybe it wasn't our local comic shop, but it was the mall, the movie theater, perhaps even La Biblioteca. We've all been there, we all had parents who didn't want to spend the weekend with us, and as annoying as the spectacle of sad and fail is to behold, we have no real place to pass judgment. \n\nAfter all, we're the ones buying comic books and action figures we'll never take out of the box. And the shops can afford to carry such ridiculous fare from all the income they get hosting Magi-Yugi-Mon events.\n\nBut wait, if AAB&C doesn't cater to such a crowd...how do they...wait what?\n\nIn my reviews of other comic book outlets, I've referred to AAB&C to \""All About Crooks & Comics\"". \n\nThis is not a mere clever nickname given by the fund-deprived; AAB&C has a reputation for ripping off those poor and unfortunate few who come across a rare or vintage back issue/piece of memorabilia and bring it in hoping to get a reasonable price for it. \n\nI can't prove from first-hand experience, as I'm not a \""collector\"", I'm a reader. I don't keep my books in bags, and with the exception of a set of JTHM I got for Christmas from Misty S, I don't even have any recent single issues. I just wait for them to come out on trade paperback. \n\nI know. The horror. The horror.\n\nBut I have had a lot of friends who've griped to me about going back to AAB&C and finding the same book they sold them a few weeks ago on sale for 3, 4, or perhaps even 5 times the amount it was bought. \n\nGranted, this is a common occurrence in all \""Used & New\"" businesses; remember that commercial for Gamestop where the guy mentions that he's selling his copy of [Random First Person Shooter] for 15 bucks? Yeah, that never fucking happens. That guy would be lucky if he got 10, and that's including the 10% extra that his Gamestop card would give him, if he was smart enough to sign up for one in the first place. \n\nBut if AAB&C doesn't really buy into the whole \""trading card/clicking miniature figures\"" craze, it makes you wonder where the profit comes from. Especially when there's a Samurai on Indian School & 7th St, an Atomic Comics at 28th Dr and Peoria, Stalking Moon on Greenway and Hero Comics on T-Bird.\n\nMaybe AAB&C primarily services \""serious buyers\"" who do not have the time or patience for all the hub-bub and tomfoolery to be had at the other, trendier locations. Maybe it's those same people who gave this place all 5's (except the one who admits they only come in to buy gift certificates). \n\nMaybe that's where AAB&C's niche lies, and we should accept that certain people want certain things out of the places they give their patronage.\n\nWho knows? You've probably stopped giving a shit about what I say ever since I admitted I only buy trades. \n\nBut don't lie, you've got a friend who spouts nothing but quotes from Plato and Socrates, and every time he walks away everyone in your group is all \""I just want to kick that guy in the fucking balls!\""  \n\nUnless that friend is you.\n\nYou ass."
3,"I like this location.  They have a lot of turnover, but for the most part everyone has been pretty good.  Wish the outside tables were cleaned more often.  They are too dirty 90% of the time to use."

I don't eat meat or pork, so I ONLY wanted chicken. I flat out said, \""Good-Bye!\"" to her & walked out,  as I was walking out, I made sure that I told everyone in line that they were out of chicken. I was very upset!  NO restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken! I would think that a restaurant would be or even should be embarrassed to be running out of a 'staple' such as chicken, don't you think? and the girl was so nonchalant about it, too."
0,"Since the BF moved to Phoenix last fall, I've been taking him on an informal tour of old school Phoenix eateries.  As part of our vintage dining tour, we finally make it to Katz Delicatessen & Sandwich Shop.  It definitely has an old school feel right down to the vintage diner interior.\n\nThe food was fine.  The bagels and cream cheese were good, but not outstanding.  Our lunches were serviceable, but forgettable.  It was amusing to watch the antics of the staff that outnumbered the diners at lunch by nearly 3:1.  With so many people out front, it appeared that there was only one short order cook and our food took way too long for simple deli offerings.\n\nThe real negative for me was the restroom.  I'm not expecting a marble shrine like the men's room at the Ritz-Carlton, but I want the rest room at a place that serves food to be clean and somewhat up to date.  The men's room at Katz was on par with some gas station restrooms that I have been unfortunate enough to see.  We're talking totally gross El Bano del Diablo here.  The dining room itself also needs a thorough cleaning, but the restroom was totally off-putting for me."
4,"I brought in a pair of red suede Dolce Vita heels, with a rather large black scuff mark on the side of it, thinking there wasn't anything I could do to save them due to the color and material. However, Nerik proved me wrong and made them look almost brand new again. I was beyond impressed and completely satisfied with his work! I would highly recommend them for all your shoe and alteration needs! Thanks again Central Shoe Repair!"
4,"Sonora is wonderfully average.\n\nYou will never be surprised by anything here, as when they tell you the beer won't be cold because it's casket, it won't be cold. The hot wings are hot, the fresh salads are fresh, and they always cook things to order and are always accurate (mid rare is always mid rare... a rarity!). I love brewhouses so the local brews are delish.\n\nThere's nothing surprisingly good at Sonora, but I'll choose it over a culinary adventure almost anyday!"
3,Good stuff.  Haven't had too much of the food.  Onion rings are delicious.  All beers delicious.  Good joint to grab a growler for the drive home...I mean for when you get home.
2,"Came here last Sunday for a few pints ($3 each!), and I have some highs and lows to share about this place. To steal a word from Bud Light, the beers here had a lot of \""drinkability\"". My hefeweizen was very smooth, and there were no complaints about the Pilsner, IPA, or the Vanilla Porter. Nice flavors all around!\n\nBut the $5 appetizers were not as pleasant, I'm afraid. The seared ahi sliders looked delicious, and they tasted pretty good. The wasabi aioli was a bit overpowering, but I would order them again. The black bean chili fries were just mediocre. It sounds fancy with the melted Oaxaca cheese on top, but they don't taste like anything special. The cheese quesadilla was way too bland for a cheese lover like myself, and their bruschetta was alright, but a bit too different.\n\nI'll be back to try an entree sometime, but I'm not expecting much. I love the cozy patio and great beer. Support local breweries and come here. As long as you stick to the beer, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Delicious, finely crafted beer! Good food and friendly staff."
2,Average beer... Great food.
1,"My buddy and I decided to stop in and try this place on the way home from a party at Four Peaks Brewery. I'm a wheat beer fan, so i usually order something along those lines...not hoppy, not malty, just wheaty. I decided to try their Horizon hefeweizen. The relatively indifferent waitress informed me that they were out. She told me to try the Stinger Pale Ale. She said that if I normally drink wheats that I would like the Stinger, too, which I thought was kinda weird. Well, I tried it and didn't like it. No big deal. I was ready to try something else. That was before she completely ignored our table for 20 mins. She seemed like she was more interested in cleaning and talking to some guys at the bar. When she finally brought our bill we paid and didn't leave a tip, because we felt she didn't deserve one. She actually followed us out to the parking lot and yelled \""thanks for the tip\"". Weird! I'll never be going back to that place again."
1,"If you're into great craft beer, don't waste your time here. The cask conditioned IPA tastes like dish water. Food was average. Meh."

I had to call the Hilton customer service line TWICE and complete a survey before I heard back from the hotel, and after that I received 1 free regular room stay.\nMotel 6 service at a Hilton price. Just stay somewhere else & save yourself the frustration."

3,"M Catering recently serviced a high-profile members-only museum opening at the Heard Museum, and did a wonderful job from what I could see as an attendee. They served some great customized tamales with goat cheese, another appetized with rice and duck that was quite nice, and a flan that was the talk of several tables of guests. If I was going to throw an event in Phoenix (Unlikely since I live in NM), I'd check this outfiy out."
4,"Phoenix's best bar!  Everyone is welcome. Bored with the usual, join the interesting set at C7. Friday night's drag show starts about 10:30 and Daveena Ross is an elegant hostess. Bring $1s to help them fund college or make-up. If you like clones, stay away. If you like humanity, come on down!"
4,"As a Socially Liberal Feminist I would NEVER go here, but if I slipped up, The Hi-Liter  would be my favorite of the genre.\n\nI've heard that it's just seedy enough, but not too much, and with top notch \""talent\"".  I mean ... that's what I've heard anyway.\n\n*Oink Oink*"
2,"Not the biggest, baddest or hottest strip club in town but for a night out with my friends it was fun.  Plenty of good looking girls, not too pushy and very friendly.  Dances were decent for $10, some girls were much better at it then others.  Drinks were typically overpriced, just like any other strip club.  When there's another night out with the guys...I'll make sure to bring this place up again."
3,"I won't lie, I've been here once or twice.  Not on par with Canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley."
3,The girls are beautiful!!! Bartenders & waitresses are AMAZING.. The DJ's are great... This place is FUN... The drink specials are always good... \n\nDON'T EAT THERE.... The cook is dirty... don't get me wrong the food is great... But don't eat if Chef Rudy is cooking he's dirty he does dirty nasty to the food..
3,"Really crazy selection of invitations. I cant believe how many books they had!! Wow, definitely more than any other venue in Phoenix. \n\nThat said, unless you are thinking of invitations over $8/person (not possible for me because I have an insane guest list), then it is not the place for you. I guess they have a lot of invitation books for less, but that selection is not nearly as exciting or unique as the high end stuff.\n\nThe women who I met there were not friendly but not rude either - definitely tend to leave you alone to sort through things.\n\nI didnt end up ordering anything from here because I found beautiful invitations that looked very expensive for a lot less through Hallmark.\n\nBut this is a place I would definitely recommend to START (and possibly finish, if you're lucky) invitation shopping. You learn a LOT about the different possibilities and styles."
4,This is the only place I go when I need greeting cards. The store has a wonderful assortment of gifts and seasonal items. The women who work there treat you like family.
2,"I agree that Juans is good but its not the best Mexican food I have ever had. What makes or breaks a Mexican restuarant for me is the chip and salsa and I thought the chips and salsa were average at Juans.\nI had the combo #15 which is a cheese enchilada and a beef or chicken taco w rice and beans. The refried beans were the best part, they are super tasty. The price is right and the portions are big."
3,"Lots of food, low price\nLarge choice, good chips, salsa warm\nTastes good anytime\n\nI was sure I'd written another review of Juan's.  The pictures on the Welcome tab still scream, \""Write! write! write!\"" at me.\n\nWhy am I trying to write Haiku for a Mexican restaurant?  \n\nArizona, U.S.A.  \n\nNevermore"
3,This place is awesome!!  been going here for years the # 1 is the way to go red chili is amazing
0,"This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food. \n\nUnfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week, night or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!\n\nI suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted."
3,"Alright, I'm not gonna lie. I like Oregano's. I've only dined here a couple of times over the last couple of years. That is, after trying to eat here on more than several occasions and leaving annoyed with the parking or the hour wait on a Friday night (seriously, whyyy??). I thought for sure I was over the whole Oregano's bit until Friday night, when the boy suggested we bring my visiting mother there for dinner. \n\nI agreed, we went, we parked (good parking, too), we waited the 45 minutes, and we ate. Let me say this again, we ATE. Ate and ate and ate and ate. Two appetizers, three entrees, three cocktails, and a pizzookie later, we were completely beat. And we left with four to-go boxes...\n\nThe food was all delicious. Yes, it was commercial and not spectacular, but it was good. I recommend the Boom Dip, Meatball Sub, Bollo Pasta, and the glorious half-baked, warm, gooey cookie with ice cream on top (I don't think they can call it a \""pizzookie\"" anymore, law suit or something). Mmmm. The drinks are all great, too, but I must warn you, they have a two drink MAXimum, so I wouldn't plan on drinking too much while you're there. \n\nOver all, it was a fun experience. The atmosphere is great (it's loud), the servers are friendly, and if you have the right friends with you, you're guaranteed to have a good time."
3,"I like so many things on the menu it takes forever to decide what to order. You have to keep in mind that you have to save room for the pzookie. This is a must! Pzookie is a huge chocolate chip cookie in a cast iron dish served warm with ice cream on it. UM Yeah, its freakin delicious. Anyway the beefstro salad is awesome. Normally i don't care for steak in a salad but this is very thinly sliced rib eye and its so good, and big enough for 2-3 to share. The wings are really good and they are all drum stick wings and three kinds of sauces. The original is best. The Italian wedding soup with a meat ball is so tasty. The Big Ravioli is really good and stuffed with lots or cheese meat and topped with marinara sauce. But the Chicago Style deep dish pizza is awesome. Its huge very filling so don't order unless your with a group of people. It takes about 30 minutes to make but its so worth it. Just remember to save room for the pzookie. Even if you are stuffed order the pzookie cause when you see it and try it you will finish it!!!"
4,Second try:\n\nSo I am updating my review! Received the giftcard and went ahead and tried it again ( dinned in this time around ) it was PERFECTION.  We'll go back for sure!
3,"I've always enjoyed Oregano's. Who doesn't like their pizza and pasta dishes or their pazooki (i always share the half and half)?!\n\nBut recently, I found my favorite dish ever and will order it every time I go. After I realized how much I enjoyed it, I found out it's the healthiest thing on the menu! Or at least that's what someone told me. Either way - the Big Beefstro Salad is what I will be ordering from now on. It's filled with shaved rib-eye, jalapenos, sweet onions and a sweet serrano dressing atop the greens.\n\nOh, and sometimes I like to indulge in the Dirty Monkey - it's delicious, but strong."
2,"One of the things I love about this place is the outdoor seating in the cooler months.  I also love the Bellini, Toasted Ravioli, and Rosemary-Chicken Pizza.\n\nThere IS room for improvement, however.  The takeout \""system\"" they are using has caused me to go somewhere else more than once.  I don't think that having certain pickup \""windows\"" for loyal customers is a sufficient way to reward them, especially at that price point.\n\nOregano's, you have a LOT of good competition (especially in Central Phoenix) so you may want to rethink the way you are treating customers.  I'm going to try you out again soon so we'll see how things go from there."
0,"I Love Oregano's, but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointed"
4,"Excellent waiters, nice and clean tables and floor. Good food portions.decent prices. Food is delicious and fresh. Beer was excellent ."
3,"This location has a nice patio, but it is too close to parking lot and a bunch of flies make their home out there as well. My salad was huge as usual for a small and I can't recall the name, but it had feta and cranberries I think and then I added chicken for three bucks more. You know what you are getting here and it's usually good and worth the price since leftovers are almost always available."
0,"While I would normally rate this restaurant with five stars, this week's experience was so disappointing that I writing to warn other patrons.  I had surgery Monday and was in pretty poor shape.  The following day friends offered to bring me dinner and the thing I craved more than anything else was an Oregano's Favorite Salad.  \n\nMy friends ordered take out and brought dinner to my home.  Much to my disappointment, instead of the amazing salad I usually enjoy when eating at the restaurant, I got a container of iceberg lettuce with a smaller container of shredded chicken.  NONE of the normal ingredients (other that then iceberg and the chicken) were on the salad.  It was awful, if the iceberg had been missing literally nothing else would have been in the container.  \n\nNeedless to say we were all very disgruntled, but given my post-surgery state, no one was able or wanted to drive all the way back to the location to get them replaced.  We all ordered the same salad and all received the same lackluster container of lettuce.  Sooooo disappointing - I will never again order take out from this restaurant."
0,"DO NOT GET KEYS MADE HERE!\n\nI am so annoyed with this Ace. I moved into a new place and needed to get keys made. The cashier paged someone and after waiting about 15 minutes I headed toward the exit, then he finally arrived. I had 5 keys made, 2 didn't fit.  Went back to have the 2 fixed, 1 still didn't work. Ugh!\n\nFast forward a year later and keep in mind my deteriorating memory, I once again had to get keys made and returned to this location. I got 5 made, 2 didn't work (sound familiar). When I went  back to get the keys fixed the woman who helped me told me it is not usually the fault of the people cutting the keys, but the calibration of the machine. She assured me the machine was just calibrated so we should have no issues. \n\nAnd guess what? One of the keys STILL doesn't fit."
1,"gotta say that this place failed on the majority. service was slow and rude. the hummus was almost all tahini, no lemon juice, and no seasoning. lentil soup was like chef boyardie chili gone bad.\n\ni dont recommend this place at all. lots of choices in the area."
2,"Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe is an interesting place.  It's located in a dodgy strip mall east of Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub.  A weird location, but once you walk through the door of Cherry Blossom you are transported to a little rustic restaurant setting.  It was a nice surprise.\n\nThe place was busy.  We had to wait for a little bit because we didn't have a reservation.  Our table finally opened up and the three of us took our seats.  I was pleasantly surprised with the prices on the menu.  The place wasn't going to break us.  Another thing I noticed was that the menu items were all over the place.  Sushi, Japanese Food, Asian Noodles, Italian Pasta and so on.\n\nOur waitress was an interesting soul.  I will leave it at that.  She showed up to take our order and deliver our food and that was pretty much it.  Our water glasses were empty for most of our dinner.  I ended up pouring our bottle of wine because my date refused to pour it.  He gave up on our waitress.\n\nWe had Spring Rolls with a peanut sauce and a Spicy Tuna Roll to start the dinner.  I enjoyed the spring rolls.  The spicy tuna roll was a little bit fishy.  I was scared.  My main dish was the Korean Spicy Beef.  It was one of their signature dishes.  I don't know why.  It was just okay.  The sauce was very rich.  Almost overwhelming.  I forced my self to keep eating.  I don't think I will order that again.\n\nCherry Blossom creates a nice environment and the prices are right.  No wonder it is crowded.  When I return I will try something else.  After all the menu is huge.  Something has to be good on there.  Three stars."
4,"My friend told me about this place a while back and raved about the ramen, and I thought, \""wow, I guess this place must be worth trying!\"" Well, my husband and I went there for dinner last week and we were not disappointed!\n\nI loved the ambiance. I loved that the meal doesn't start out with any old bread basket, but one with a delicious roll, yummy cinnamon-sugar toast, and excellent banana bread! Definitely a shocker, coming to a noodle place, but a pleasant surprise :)\n\nThe menu is broad and eclectic, ranging from Italian linguine to curry noodles, from ramen to sushi, and an impressive and surprising selection of rice dishes.\n\nI had asian wheat noodles with chicken (I don't remember the name of the dish), and it was very tasty! While we were there, we heard another customer telling his friend that he's tried many things on the menu, and everything has been delicious. I believe it. They say a large part of taste comes from our sense of smell, and this place was just brimming with incredible aromas! I can't wait to go back and try more yummy dishes!"
2,"I've been here twice now. Initially, I was impressed at the management of a huge table (we had like 20 people) and the waitress had no problem doing separate checks and was quick upon return with the checks and change.  Yet when I went with just another person, although crowded, the service was not that great. \n\nThe one thing that was odd - some food came out fairly quickly, yet others' orders took forever.  Some of my friends waited about 20 minutes after everyone else received their dishes, and it's not like they ordered something totally different. In fact, some of the orders were identical to the other friends. Then again, we did have 20 people.  During the time I was just with another person, it was a similar thing - my food came out way earlier than my friend's. \n\nI ordered the summer rolls that were quite tasty, and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered miso soup and edamame which were both delicious. My mom ordered the pad Thai and loved it. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food one could order for a decent price.  \n\nThe parking could likely get to be a problem. I managed to find a spot, but during busier hours with the other surrounding businesses, I imagine it would be messy.  Also, the only other negative thing was that my mojito was really not that tasty."
3,"This place was AWESOME!!!  My wife and I have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in, I had a yearning for Ramen.  It did not disappoint.  We got there just before happy hour, which is always a bonus, but would still go outside of happy hour.  The menu is quite extensive, the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well.  We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley, having been to many \""Japanese\"" restaurants.\n\nWe decided to try many different dishes, and were equally impressed with all.  I had the TanTan-Men, a spicy Ramen with pork, delicious.  We shared some tuna sashimi, which was fresh and tasty (looked like real pink, no added color).  We also shared the Seafood Delight roll, which has tuna, 'krab' and is topped with a scallop, fantastic.  The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs, this was my least favorite, but still good.  Of course the Kirin (on draft) was flowing as well as the house Saki.\n\nOverall the CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe impressed us to say the least.  We will be back to try more.  Thank you CherryBlossom, keep up the Great Work."
1,"Since it's walking distance from our house I like to try places near us.  This was our 3rd visit to Cherry Blossom.  We'll, we have made the decision it's not that great.  \n\nFood:  Average...believe me there is better. \n\nService:  Wait staff is always overwhelmed and run around like chicken with their heads cut off.  We were sitting near a table being cleaned off by a frantic employee and she was wiping so fast the dirty food was hurdled into our table top - gross!  Have to beg to get our green ice tea refilled, trying to make eye contact with service staff and they avoid you. The whole place is under staffed and overwhelmed.  \n\nNOTE:  Manager/Owner = Get a food runner.  Thats all they do -- run food!  It's simple. I am sure the service staff doesn't want to pay out their tips to a food runner.  But, its either that or loose more customers due your very bad service."
4,"Amazing that a cafe like this can do great sushi, Italian pasta, and ramen!  Try the low carb soy noodles in your Italian dish.  Good stuff."
4,LOOOOVE this place!! PAD Thai is delicious :)
2,"2nd time eating here and just as good as the first.  Lunch menu has affordable eats at various prices. The bread basket, which seems weird at a Asian fusion place, was standard but do try the toasted bread slices with cinnamon which slip to the bottom.  The tempura is light and tasty, Cajun shrimp pasta is to die for, Pad Thai comes with a plate full of noodles and veggies.  Service is slow because of the crowds.  Had to ask for more water and it took more than a moment to receive the bill.  A bit overpriced for noodles yet still good.  I would not make a special trip to visit."
3,"Not the best country club I have ever golfed at, but pretty nice all the same.  The course itself is well maintained, though it was aerated recently.  Customer service is obviously touted here and it shows throughout the entire facility.  I had a nice experience and will definitely be back soon."
0,Absolutely horrible. Don't bother coming here. We came because its and Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut so everyone could get something they liked. We waited 20 minutes just for the tacos and 35 minutes for 3 pan pizzas. The staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes. The assistant manager did apologize to us but she should probably get rid of the whole staff there especially the young black girl who had the absolute worst attitude out of all of them. Don't go here. There's plenty of other places to go around here.
1,"They told me that the oil change would take an hour to an hour and a half. It ended up taking three hours as they waited for a part. In their defense they said it was possible it would take longer. That was fine but when the person at the front\ndesk starts talking politics, swearing, and pushing his beliefs, that is when the line of professionalism was crossed. The car works great but the customer service left much to be desired."
4,"Dr. Keith's office called our house to remind me that my appointment was the following day. My girlfriend answered and told them \""Oh don't worry, he'll be there.....he just loves to go to the dentist\"".\nI love going to Dr. Keith's office. They are gentle , thorough, caring and honest. They do excellent work.  Thanks Scott for taking care of me over the years."
4,"We had a terrific experience here.  Tim the manager was very approachable and explained the process very clearly.  They listened to my specific needs (when I needed my car back, etc) and accommodated me.   More importantly, the job they did was fantastic-a repair to back bumper, and the work was immaculate.\n\nI would highly recommend them!"
1,"Great service, terrible food. I was looking forward to eating at Christo's and the longer I was there, the more disappointed I became. Funky house salad with a creamy ranch (?) dressing and one slice of bad hot house tomato. The lemon rice soup was boiling hot, but not awful. White French baguette bread and butter was plentiful, thank god. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was bland and my veal entr\u00e9e was drowned in sauce. The service was 5 star, I'll give them that. I suppose I came away with the thought that I'd rather have lousy service and good to great food than great service and lousy food. Maybe I should have tried one of the 3,000 specials our Italian waiter rattled off before we ordered. By the time he was finished, the only thing I remembered him saying was, \""...topped with feta cheese.\"""
1,"I lived at Paradise Palms for 2.5 years. The first year, I was on the north side in a split level condo and I down sized to the south side after making the desicion to go back to college. I was extremely disappointed when I moved into my apartment. Building 1501 #4 is not what the model apartment advertises. The wood laminate is different and ugly, there is carpet in the hallway and something is wrong with the flooring in the hallway as well(I think the carpet is kept to cover something up). I think the a/c unit is at least 30 years old and you will pay for it if you live in those apartments. You will also be sweating while your thermostat says its set at 74 degrees. So in the summer time, my down sizing cost was a wash. Also to mention that anytime I would go into the office, Kevin would talk to me about partying and people crashing at his house because they were to drunk to drive all the way home from his house in Maricopa. (I have been sober for along time and found this extremely unprofessional). Last but not least upon my move out date, I ended up in the ER extremely ill. I tried to contact the office 8 times with one voicemail on my move out date to let them know that I was in the hospital. No one answered and no one called me back until the next day. It was Calvin the maintenence man. I told him what had happened and that I tried to call several times. His response was \""well you are probably going to have to pay for another day since you still have some stuff in the apartment.\"" The maintenance man was telling me that I needed to pay more after being hospitalized!!!!! I told him \""no\"", I won't be\"" and that I will call back later when I was more lucid. So I tried to call 6 more times that day and no one answered. I showed up to the apartment in the evening time and got the 3 boxes and vacuum cleaner out of the apartment and went to drop off my keys. The new manager(who I believe was a poor decision in bringing on), was just sitting at her desk. The office was super quiet and her attitude was like I owed her something because her maintenance guy wasn't charging me for another day.........these experiences left a bad taste in my mouth and I am so grateful I do not live there anymore!!! Beware of the level of class you are getting at these apartments...you get what you pay for!!!"
4,"One of my commitments over the past year and into 2011 has been to shift more of our dollars toward local businesses. Sure, I still buy stuff online and at some national chains, but I've also made a conscious decision to look for a local alternative wherever I can. \n\nWhen it came to printing new business cards for my husband's business, instead of taking advantage of the super cheap prices and free shipping from Vistaprint again, I turned to the directory on the Local First website for some guidance. \n\nI found a few local printing companies and contacted them all via email with a small introduction and a request for a quote for this relatively small project.\n\nSusan from Impact was the first response I received - long before others' responses started trickling in. After receiving quotes from various companies, I did a little bit of price comparison, and asked some of the companies a few more questions about recommendations for the right paper, about file types and fonts, and about turn-around time.\n\nWith regard to price, Impact wasn't the \""cheapest\"" but they certainly weren't expensive. My quotes from a total of six companies ranged between $27.00 to $75.00 for comparable quotes: 500 cards, two-sided, full color on one side, with an aqueous coating.  Impact quoted me $55.00. Four of those six companies quoted comparably.\n\nSo what made me go with Impact? By the time I had finished all my comparing and asking, I'd had several email exchanges with Susan, and every response was so thorough and so friendly and so above-and-beyond, that I didn't really care. She won me over with excellent customer care.\n\nChristmas came and I fell off the map for a week, and you'd better believe she picked up right where we left off and was very understanding! \n\nYesterday I picked up the finished cards. And it wasn't enough that the cards turned out excellent. They close at 5 and Susan patiently waited for me after closing time, as I fought traffic on the 51 and then on the suicide lane on 7th Street so that I would be able to pick up the cards in time for my husband's business trip. \n\nSome people may say, \""meh... big deal. that's what they SHOULD do...\"" But the truth is, it IS a big deal. I don't meet this level of customer care too often. So, when the product is great and the customer care is unmatched, the choice is obvious as to who will get my business."
1,"I would like to give Karsh's 4 stars and here are the reasons why.  If you want kosher, they have it.  If you'd like to have sugar free, they have a nice variety, provided you go in early in the day.  They actually have quite a nice variety-a little something for everybody-and they do take orders.\n\nSound's good doesn't it.  What is not good is the schizophrenic nature of the service you get at this place.  I can deal with their prices which are higher than they should be.  I won't deal with holding my breath and wondering if the person helping me is going to be pleasant or borderline nasty. It's been that way for sometime and isn't getting any better.  The result is for the most part I tend to avoid the place.  Scott's Generations, the deli a few doors down, is more appreciative of your business.  I'll spend my money there.  Their bagels are better and they have bialy's, too.\n\nIf you are going to chance this place, I have one suggestion for you.  DON'T go in near closing.  Likely as not, you will be told you exactly how many minutes you have before they close.  They are blatant about doing this especially if you aren't ready to tell them exactly what you want at that moment.  I guess the fact they are emptying the cases in front of your eyes is not clue enough they are closing.   \n\nAnother reason not to go there is not their fault.  They are off of 7th Street with the traffic lanes that change with the time of day.  I'll face the craziness those lanes cause to go to the Bashas and Scott's Generation but not  Karsh's.  \n\nIt's rather sad to have to write a review like this."
2,"I went in Karsh's against my better judgment because my friend really wanted to try something they had available.  They were surprisingly friendly and courteous, not one of their Mr. Hyde days, I thought.  It occurred to me to bring up my complaint about them because I so rarely enter their doors that what ever they thought didn't matter anyway.  It surprised me to learn that the management has brought in almost a whole new staff to replace the nasty ones. (I have to admit I looked and didn't see people I recognized from before. They were responding to continuing complaints.  I'll be going in again soon to get bread.  We'll see."
1,"I had such high hopes for this bakery when I moved into the neighborhood last year. I've made quite a few visits there and I think I will not be returning.\n\nFirst, the service. EVERY time I've gone, without fail, I have been put off by the service. There are usually 3 or 4 people behind the counter, just awkwardly STARING at you as you browse the baked goods. They either ignore you completely or try to rush you into choosing, either way I always leave feeling like my business inconvenienced and annoyed them. \n\nSecond, the food. Honestly, it's just not any good. At all. Cookies, bagels, muffins, pastries, bread...they are all pretty bad in quality and are WAY overpriced. I've gotten, and will continue to get, better quality products for way less at the Bashas bakery 2 doors down.\n\nToday was the last straw. The rather rude employees actually made comments to each other about another customer as soon as that person left the store. I couldn't even FINISH some of what we bought today which really says something. Never in my life have I ever left a sweet treat unfinished! And my loaf of \""fresh sourdough\"" was stale and completely tasteless. I have no clue how they've been in business so long, or how they've gotten so many glowing reviews."
4,"I just moved here from Seattle and wanted to have a hotdog.  I saw this place one night when it was close and we decided to go back the next day when they opened.\n\nThe menu was intimadating at first, so I had to ask the girl what was what.  I ordered the quarter pound.  Yummy!  BF ordered the Reuben, which looked really good with the cheese sauce on it.\n\nWe will be back"
1,"Nothing special, to be honest.  I am a huge supporter of small business owners. Sadly, Sonic has better tasting hotdogs and buns. Also his lemonade offered with special (says machine is broken, awaiting repair) is disgusting, watered down. Sadly, after all these years driving by... I know why I have not ever stopped in....and never will again.  :/"
4,Literally the best. \n\nAlways have free samples and are willing to skewer just about everything they own on a toothpick for you to try.\n\nThis is a good first step if you dream of having a good relationship with a butcher like all those TV chefs do.
3,"I really dig the rhythm room! I went to a concert here on Monday night. \n\nit was cute.\nit was quaint.\nit was CLEAN.\ngreat bartenders, love the option to sit or to stand. \n\nthe sound guy was a bit off and im pretty sure my ear is still ringing from the high pitched squeel when the microphones got too close to the speaker or something. but hey, it happens i guess. \n\ni had a blast at this sweet little spot."
2,"I caught Azure Ray and Tim Fite here last week and I'm ashamed to say...it was my first time here. Knew of it, drove by it, it's in my 'hood, just never had the opportunity to check it out. \n\nThe good:\nI love small, intimate venues! At one point we were sitting on the side of the stage and I was literally rubbing elbows with Tim Fite in his coveralls. Fortunately (and unfortunately, I guess) there was not a whole lot of people at the show so getting a seat at the bar or up close was not that difficult. \n\nSlightly irritating: \nThe doormen and bouncers were rather frowny and you can't take your drinks (or even water) onto the patio. \n\nThe great:\nYay for a cool venue/dive that's not in Tempe!\n\nAnyway, a great chill show. I laughed and sang, held myself and cried. Definitely plan on grabbing a drink here in the very near future."
1,The music was good.  The beer was warm.  Wheat beer served warm can contain bacteria.  The person I was with and myself were both sick for three days.
4,LOVE going to the eye doctor now!  They can get me in and out in no time.  Extremely friendly staff!
4,"Staff is knowledgable and friendly. They have a big space, and hold lots of comic related event, but also gaming events for RPG's and CCG's. I visited all the comic shops when I moved here from NYC looking for a new on to feed my comic addiction, and Samurai is the one that I choose as the most real."
4,"Okay, so first up...let me offer a disclaimer.  I am currently employed part time at Samurai Comics.  But here's why...\n\nI shopped at Samurai Comics starting my last year of High School (2001-2002).  I had shopped at a chain comic shop before that for 3 years.  3 years later, they still didn't know my name.  They just knew me as the guy that dropped a100 bucks in there store every two weeks.  I went to the oldest comic book shop in Phoenix, and got that weird \""too trendy\"" feel from them.  Driving down Camelback, I saw a sign that said COMICS.  I screeched to a halt and went in to check out Samurai Comics.  I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door.\n\nUnlike the other stores I had shopped at, I was asked if I needed any help when I was wandering the store.  I mentioned that I was looking for a new place to set up a subscription.  This was with Ray (who still works there) and Brandon.  The nerd talk started to fly fast and furious as they asked what books I was interested in.  Super friendly people, so I decided to go ahead and set up the sub.\n\nI walked in two weeks later and got my sub.  The guy behind the counter (Jeff, who no longer works there but is an awesome dude) informed me that he tossed some extra books in that I was under no obligation to buy.  He just saw that they had Batman in them and that my list was primarily Batman.  These are books that didn't even advertise having the Bat in them, so I totally would have missed out in these books!  So I got a good vibe from the place.\n\nI came in a week later, and was greeted by my first name.  Seriously, I had come in 3 times in a month and Mike and Moryha knew my name and had a good idea of what books I was crazy about.  I was blown away.  Fantastic service.\n\nAnyways, I graduated High School and moved to Tucson for UofA.  Being a starved college student paying his own way through school, I couldn't afford comics.  I graduated UofA and moved back to Phoenix.  I went to the shop right across the street from my house, the one I used to shop at prior to Samurai.  They still had no idea who I was after I talked to them for 10 minutes, trying to jog their memory.  So I left and drove to Camelback.  I walked into Samurai to restart my sub and Moryha was behind the counter.  She looked at me for a moment, and said \""Chris, right?\""\n\nSeriously, 4 years later and the staff remembered me.  And the vast majority of my subscription books.  I feel obligated to tell you that I had grown a full beard by then and (unfortunately put on some weight) :(  And still she recognized me.\n\nAnd that's what makes Samurai Comics the best comic shop in Phoenix.  They may not have the back issue selection of some stores, but they have customer service that no other store in the valley can even come close to matching.  Want to be greeted by your name when you walk in?  Want to swap nerd stories and discuss the latest comics?  This is the place!\n\nAdd to that the fact they they will go out of their way to find books and items that you desire, along with one of the best selection of gaming stuff in town?  Pop culture nirvana man!\n\nI got extremely lucky coming back to Phoenix when I did.  Moryha and MIke were looking for an extra person to staff the store during the week.  They knew I was a comic book nerd and asked if I wanted a job.  But regardless of whether I was employed with them or not, I'm a Samurai Comic customer for life.  \n\nThe main location moved to a massive superstore located on 11th Street and Camelback, but it is still ran by the same people and still has that close-knit feel.  Come on in and see what I'm talking about!"
0,I have been here one time and one time only. I will never go back. I took my two kids here since my son is into pokemon and my daughter loves my little ponies. Plus it's very close where we live. I tried to get one of the three people working to help us but they seemed more interested in avoiding helping us. My questions were answered with one word or a finger point. My daughter was able to find a couple of comics but we never did find the cards my son was pointed to. When we checked out the person behind the counter said is this it and rolled their eyes. Not the kind of experience i expected of a place geared to all ages. I was disappointed to say the least.
3,"I pass by this walgreens on the way home so I stop in frequently. Always able to find what I need. Clean and organized, will come again."
1,"Go to to FedEx Office if you need passport photos. I needed one and stopped at this Walgreens after being referred here by a nearby UPS Store. The first Walgreens employee wasn't sure how to work their new camera, so he and Employee #2 went back and forth about that for a minute or two. Finally he used their regular camera to take it anyway. Then, they couldn't print it for me because they were in the middle of an enormous greeting card order which apparently couldn't be paused long enough to print my picture. They took my name and number to call me when that order was complete and they'd printed my photo. \n\nNearly four hours later, I called the store because no one had called me. I stayed on hold four long times while they repeatedly rang the Photo Department, and no one ever picked up. So then I was passed to the store manager, who put me on hold only to come back and say the printing equipment had failed. Uh, and just when was someone gonna call me and tell me this?? \n\nSomeone finally did call back the next day after they found my pic in their system, but by that time I got my photo elsewhere. Save yourself the trouble and just stick to getting snacks, water, and cards at Walgreens."
3,"Great place to find inexpensive, gently used item for your infant and bigger child. From bedding, highchairs and excersaucers to clothes and shoes and toys. They have a 50/50 consignment plan ( cash or store credit) and will display everything for 90 days. If it doesn't sell you get all your non sold items back.  The new management that took over the business last February vamped the store up and it looks better and better and they are super friendly and always willing to help. Always had a great experience. They have a Facebook page too in which they list new item in pictures. Highly recommended."
4,"Maybe I gave this one too many stars because nothing compares with Houston's Grand Opera, but the Arizona Opera is still good and definitely worth seeing.\n\nHint:  If you come at 6 pm instead of when it starts at 7 pm you can hear a talk about the opera, which will help you understand it better if you're a newbie!  Cool, huh?\n\nRegardless, you're either going to just love opera or hate it.  I'm a lover = season tickets which includes the price of the parking garage at $8 (compared to $10 at the local garages).  I think the total bill ran $130 or $150.  So worth it if you are one of the opera lovers!"
4,Oops...-\nI forgot to add to my review about Jayme my stylist...that out of all the cities I've lived in & stylists I've visited...Jayme is by far my favorite & the most personable & talented stylist in town! Make an appointment today...you won't be disappointed!!!:)
3,Great salon tucked next to Fuego Bistro. I have been seeing Mara for years and I leave a happy customer every time.  I love that she knows how I like my hair cut and make sure that I don't chop it all off. Mara offers fantastic hair cuts for a great price! She offers hair coloring services and she does amazing work. She's the best secret in Phoenix!
0,Be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now.
1,"I've been here a few times and unfortunately its never been a great experience.  I think the first time it was a three star, but the last time was definitely a two--maybe even a one and a half star.  The service was terrible.  Granted, we were a large party with three kids, but it they clearly weren't busy and it was a weeknight.  It took them about 20 minutes to get a table together for us, which was fine.  But then it took them about another twenty minutes to take our orders.  We were so hungry we ended up devouring four baskets of chips before we even placed our orders.\n\nThe chips were probably the best part--but I can't say the red ketchup sauce is great.  We asked for a chunky salsa that was decent and ended up mixing that with the thick red ketchup sauce they give you.  I ordered a burrito with green sauce with a side of beans and rice.  It definitely wasn't anything to drool over.  It was edible, but not great.  Plus its not even super cheap.  \n\nIts a pass."
0,"I was informed by Volvo I Am that I needed a new AC compressor at a cost of $1300. I had a second opinion at the Volvo dealership who told me that my AC unit was just fine. In addition to the unethical business practices of this shop, the owner was extremely rude and aggressive."
3,"Went back to Volvo Am I for a maintenance check, and the second visit was as positive as the first.  Volvo Am I Fane"
0,I have shopped here off & on for years. I am always amazed I return due to the awful service & attitudes but with so few Needlework shops in Phoenix I have bit my tongue & gone.  I recently inquired about a Special Order Canvas for my Birthday. I FB them & called both. After 2 weeks of trying to get them to help me they responded by leaving me a phone message stating they had No Idea what canvas I was talking about. I have ordered from them before. The canvases are hundreds of dollars & I fail to see where the confusion came in considering I had Put the comeplete title & artist in my facebook message. I have ordered the canvas elsewhere. I don't know if it is just me they seem to dislike without knowing me or if it is just being outside the clique that is the issue. Order online unless your a Stepford Sticher.
4,"My second visit to Mad Hatter.  The first visit was on referral, the second was because they did such great work on the first visit.  This time, they did a manifold back exhaust for me, to include all new pipe, new o2 sensor bung, new catalytic converter and glass pack.   Part of my request was that they reroute the exhaust to give me room to put an anti-wrap bar on the rear axle of my weekend toy - a '93 Jeep Wrangler - and they accomplished that.   \n\nFurther, the previous downpipe from my exhaust manifold routinely made contact with my front driveshaft under front axle articulation, and they were able to move the new downpipe slightly to the side to eliminate that problem.  \n\nThere were some holes in the pipe near that driveshaft and near the old cat, causing my Jeep to sound like a UPS truck.  So, the bonus is that by sealing up the new pipe, they eliminated exhaust leaks, and I now have a little more power without the UPS truck engine sound.  \n\nBest of all, they did all this while I walked across the street for a bite to eat.   \n\nThanks guys!   Highly recommend!"
3,"Nobody understands. I have this weird affinity for Tokyo Express. But only this particular location. I've been to the other's in Scottsdale and Mesa and they just don't taste the same. Maybe it's because I used to come here for lunch in high school and almost everyday when I  worked at my crappy job down the street. Maybe it's just my nostalgia of growing up here and being young(er)....\nMostly, I just freakin' love the teriyaki bowls here more than any other 'yaki chain. There is never too much sauce, chicken to rice ratio is always perfect and it's always piping hot. What makes it hit the spot? A large Tropical Passion iced tea...ahhh yes...you go home, add a little Sriracha and it's the perfect meal. \nYes I feel like a loser because it's next to the wonderful Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe and I could get a much better meal there, but when you want something quick and good, this is always my favorite. \nMinus one star due to the ambience changing a bit over the years, it's smaller and they used to have this great English-style red phone booth in there, not anymore. Boo. \nI realize I've just written way too much about Tokyo Express, but nobody understands! Ah well, I will continue to remain loyal."
0,"I went to this shop based on the high ratings. \n12 days later, 2 loaner cars, $1200, many excuses, a second opinion that found the problem in minutes, and 3 chances later, the issue of new front struts and squeaking and rocking upon braking persist. The car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands. Will go to second opinion Tobias in Cave Creek next time. They seem far more on top of things."
2,"Had lunch here on a recent Saturday.  The pastrami was ok, but it was tough and sliced too thickly.  Coleslaw is good, and the pickles were just starting to get sour.\n\nThe fries were great, but not enough to make up for lackluster pastrami.\n\nI would go back, but with low expectations."
2,"Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Arlin B, Robyn N & Mike C.  Scott's was a bit of a disappointment for me this time.  My expensive bowl of Kreplach Soup was lukewarm & only contained one little Kreplach the size of a Ping Pong ball!  Even the smaller cup sized soup should have two or three of them.  My corned beef sandwich was good but the service was only so-so.  Considering all of this and the prices, it's down to 3 Stars this time for Scott's.\n\nCorned Beef Sandwich $10.95, bowl of Kreplach Soup $7.95 (!)"
1,"Way overpriced.  There sub should be priced at 6.50 tops.  It's just okay at best.  Their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt.  The worse part about it was that my buddy wanted to go somewhere else but we went to this place on my suggestion.  Fortunately, there was no rift caused in our friendship."
1,"I wish this update was for a bump up to 4 stars, unfortunately it is not. If I had written this Friday night and they didn't offer good vegan options it could have easily been a 1 star review.\n\nThe funny part of this saga is I had completely forgotten about my prior review which had to do with Pizza Heaven figuring out orders with different toppings, charges, etc. \n\nRecently I have been complaining about how expensive Z pizza has been getting, Pizza Heaven's location is closer and I thought would be cheaper so here goes; round two.\n\nThe order: 3 topping large pizza with vegan cheese, on their menu listed for $17.50. When I arrived to pick up the pie I was told \"" That will be $27.?? \"" What?!?! \""No, I just had a 3 topping pizza, just one...nothing else\"".\n\nThis is where the discussion began on how they charge for toppings, apparently their policy is to rip people off? I think we all learned in the 4th grade (ok maybe not) if you put 3 toppings on one half and 3 toppings on the second half you have used the same amount of toppings for the pie - the toppings may be different yes, but the net amount of toppings used (and might I add purchased by the establishment) is still the same. Since my girlfriend can't stand onions, and I hate those little black olives we each had our own side of 3 toppings each BUT...get this....were charged for 6 toppings! Recap: no more toppings were used total on the pizza but because they were all different apparently they have made it a policy to charge for 6 toppings. The vegan cheese was also an extra $2 but not listed on their menu online (or at the restaurant). \n\nThey ended up comping me for one topping and I didn't throw too much of a fight because I knew I would not be coming back anytime soon. Once I got home and tried the pizza it did nothing more then seal the deal. It wasn't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best.\n\nI don't feel great about writing this review, I really want to love and support independent businesses in Phoenix but when they have crazy policies like this and I have to spend $27+ to get a large mediocre pizza I need to draw the line somewhere. Phoenix has very few vegan pizza options but right now it seems like the corporate giants win again - I can get a large surfboard vegan pizza at Whole Foods, with any 3 toppings on any half, which tastes great for $15.99; no hassles.\n\nLastly I would like to comment that the girl working the cashier was very friendly and very courteous even though I was displaying clear signs of being utterly appalled. Even when I left she was still very friendly, it's safe to say she saved this from being a one star review, kudos to you."
3,"Great place, not a lot of parking.  We ordered a pizza and chicken parm.  It was really good food and the service was great.  We will be visiting this place again!"
4,Excellent pizza and great service.  The Mediterranean Pizza and Moscato wine both get 5 stars.
1,"Fry's Take-N-Bake pizzas are better than these bad boys and only a 1/4 of the cost.\n\nLast night a good buddy of mine and I had just finished up a long year of teaching and we wanted to celebrate by staying in, stuffing our faces with pizza, having a few beers and watching a movie. The beer was good, the movie was terrible, but the pizza might have been even worse! After ordering a single medium Veggie pizza using the EAT 23 online ordering service the pizza arrived about an hour after placing the order (not bad). The pizza + 10% tip was very pricey, $20 for a single medium pizza.\n\nMost of the veggies on the pizza tasted undercooked and were still dripping water as if they were not properly dried out during prep and through the oven bake. As if the pizza wasn't bad enough, to add insult to injury, my friend had made a Fry's pizza for himself that tasted much better than the pizza I had just dropped $20 on.\n\nI will not be returning here anytime soon."
2,"Have you ever noticed that almost every florist uses the same pictures on their website and somehow they are all connected to Teleflora?  One of these days I'll figure out why and how this all works... but in the meantime, since I don't have a go-to florist that I use regularly, I use whatever company is most convenient at the time.\n\nSo, when I recently wanted to send flowers to a friend of mine that was staying at the Montelucia, and the concierge told me that they use Garden of England, I went with it... \n\nI was not a fan of the $10 delivery charge, but so be it... I'm told the arrangement was colorful and beautiful... and of course it was a nice surprise for my friend upon her arrival.  I'll go direct next time for sure though - there is nothing like a personal touch - especially with flowers!"
3,First of all I cannot sew so this review is not from the point of a seamstress.  I went there for ribbons and other gold colored fabrics for center piece making and I def found more than I could ever imagine.  They have great luxurious fabrics as well as tacky sequin covered fabrics (I totally bought some).  If you need fabric you will find what you need or something very close to it.  The parking was ok but no lie the place is always packed.  As far as customer service goes it really depends on who you deal with. Some are chatty Cathys and others don't seem to care much for the customers. The bottom line is the place might look beat up but the selection is great and the people will cut your fabric and even give you a little extra if they see some damage.
2,"This place is as bad to be expected! \n\nEssentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps, ribbon and assorted accessories. \n\nTo be honest, you better come here on a scavenger hunt, or else you will be disappointed!"
1,"I'm adding to the chorus of \""the people here are incredibly rude.\"" They have this policy that you must leave behind two yards of fabric or you have to buy all of it - except it's not exactly uniformly enforced. I went to buy fabric today to make blankets for gifts, and it took me ages to sort through the leaning tower of fleece just to *find something that was at least a yard*!! There were so many pieces of fabric that had to be just six inches, 10 inches, maybe a foot and a half...hardly anything you can use for almost any sort of project. \n\nWhen I *finally* found something that was at least a yard and had a cute pattern, I took it to be cut. The woman cutting my fabric insisted I had to get additional yards of one type that I didn't even need because otherwise I'd be leaving a yard behind here and there and that was against their policy. She didn't even explain it nicely, she just said \""did you read the paper?\"" and pointed at it. I would've just returned those pieces and went back to get alternatives from the giant pile, but I had spent so much time finding at least a yard each that I was now running late.\n\nSo now I have FAR more fabric than I needed and I feel super ripped off. They have a good selection, but I'm not going back. It hardly matters if the fabric is decently priced when you have to cross your fingers and toes you'll find at least a yard of it, and then end up paying out of the rear for extra. Ugh."
3,Genny's is a hoot! I'm def Straight but NOT narrow.
1,Dennys has changed their delicious chicken fried steak to a formed meat product brick \nEPIC FAIL!!!!!!
4,I have eaten here many times the staff is great and friendly. The remodeling gives this place the old time at home dinner feeling. Love to meet here for business or just meeting friends. Wish the rest if them were like this one. Can't beat the speed of service any place in town. This location is one of the after bar stops and gets extremely busy after 1 am nightly. It is well worth th wait.
3,"Nice place. Alert and friendly staff, fun people,darts, billiards and sports on screen. Also very clean.  \nBeen twice. I live in Glendale so driving is an issue. Took a taxi over a month ago because I assumed they would be showing the ufc fights. No such luck, sports bar anyone?\nWas a fun night anyway with beer, darts and conversation. Would definately go back."
3,"I'm not some ass face who thinks gay people are vermin and their bars are cesspools of shittyness. I'm open minded, and I have been in here a few times. \n\nRoscoe's has everything a good sports bar should have, darts, pool, lots of screens, and a well stocked bar. Sure, they play crap on the radio, but it's what their customers want, and I'm understanding that if I walk into someone elses domain, I have to be prepared to listen to their music. \n\nBartender there is legit. I saw him once at the bar and when he ID'd me, he said \""thanks Fred.\"" Two weeks later, I went back and sat at the bar at the same spot, he said I look familiar and guessed my name was Fred. I was pretty damn impressed. They pour rather freely, they have great 2 for 1 specials during the week, and the Buffalo Chicken Pizza is one of my favorite things to eat in town. \n\nOverall, Roscoe's isn't a place I would really go to just to hang out... kind of a sausage fest, even more so than most sports bars. They also have music playing over the sports, which is fine for most games but when it's a big game, the TV should take precedence. That all said, Roscoe's is the only gay bar I've ever felt comfortable in. I've been in Amsterdam and Kobalt as well as a few others, and they always make me uneasy after a while. I'm not afraid of being hit on, nor do I care (I'm too scruffy and dirty for a gay bar anyway) if I am, but there are almost always conversations that I'm just not ready to hear. \n\nSo yeah, Roscoe's is a 3 star bar overall, but I wanted to give it a fourth star for being a gay bar that a straight can feel comfortable sitting in for a while."
0,"This was probably one of the worst mistakes I've ever undertaken, and I'm including that apartment in the ghetto I signed a lease for because it was \""quaint\"" and multiple men I really shouldn't have given as much of a chance as I did.\n\nBoyfriend and I thought we'd relive our childhood involving Pancho's from when we lived in North Phoenix and went to the one by Metrocenter. I had a birthday party at that one, and my party went to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer before eating (I'm talkin' Kristy Swanson here... yeah, totally super sweet). We both recalled fond memories of raising the little Mexican flag to get sopapillas.\n\nWalking in, and seeing that margaritas are not served as they should be, it was the ultimate in regret. \n\nme: \""Let's just go to Arriba. They don't have margs here, and that's really the only reason I wanted Mexican.\""\nman: \""Oh, come on. Where's your sense of adventure? I think I'll have a beer. (seeing look of disappointment on my face) Ohhhhkay, do you want to go to Arriba?\nme: (downtrodden) No, I guess we'll stay here.\n\nWe exit the line, $20 lighter, and find a seat. This place is filthy. The server, who calls me \""mija\"" at least 18 times, I find delightful for the first time she says it. Then I hear her saying it to all of the other females at her tables. Cheating bitch. The extensive salsa line looks awesome, and I perk up a little, like, maybe this won't be so bad.\n\nWRONG. WRONG. WRONG.\n\nIt WAS bad. Everything was bad. The half naked children screaming, the white people everywhere thinking this is the bees knees of Mexican cuisine... it all adds up to probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. We promptly went to Arriba and drank a marg very quickly to forget about the pain."
1,"There aren't many Mexican buffet restaurants in phoenix. Maybe because Mexican food is best served fresh. I remember the 1st time my boyfriend took me to Panchos; he remembered eating there when he was younger & wanted to go back.  The salsa isn't very good; it's bland for a Mexican place. We have gone back many times and I must admit that it has gotten worse & worse every time. The food selection has gotten worse & the price higher. We also saw them on the dirty dinning report & they got a horrible rating and neither of us was surprised. It's sad, such a great Idea & good location could have done allot better!"
4,"I hadn't considered reviewing this practice until my mom called this morning asking the name of the dentist I recently went to when I broke a molar.\n\nCurrent lack of insurance is the ONLY reason I didn't call North Mountain!  The break happened at about 6pm, and I wanted to get it taken care of the next morning.  If my insurane existed, I know I could have called North Mountain first thing the next day and gotten in - that is how great they are with priority flexibility!\n\nSadly, I was left to call places that were open past 6pm, and price shopped getting the work done. Getting in first thing the next day is the ONLY good thing to report about the dentist I ended up going to. So I told my mom I could not recommend the recent dentist I went to - but could ABSOLUTELY steer her toward North Mountain Dentistry!\n\nWhile I did see Dr. Rosen once, most of my visits for the years I was going were with Dr. Arak.  Bob D's review was spot on - everyone is very professional and upbeat and truly seems to like being there.\nWhether it was the attitude of the entire staff, the genuine caring about my mouth health, the lack of \""upselling\"" and alarmist declarations of the work I \""need\"" - or the ready availability of nitrous (I am a whimp!), the several years I was a patient at North Mountain was the only time in my life I really did go to the dentist twice a year for cleanings and checkups.\n\nAnd as soon as I get insurance again, I will be back!"
3,I can almost always find something fan-fuckin-tastic for less than half the price it'd be in it's original store.
1,"I miss the glory days of Buffalo.  Ten years ago while I was in high school, (gawd. I feel old) this used to be my favorite store.  It was a great place to find unique/alternative clothing at a decent price.  Better yet, I was apparently a stylish young thang because whenever I cleaned out my closet and took it here, I would get at least $65 in store credit to get some new digs.  \n\nThese days,  I feel like Buffalo relies more heavily on the brand than they used to.  Its not uncommon to find used jeans here for $60 or jackets for $45 - all because of the label.  I'm sure its still a great bargain, its just not \""nice thrift store\"" that I grew up on.  Its also become increasingly difficult to sell my clothing here - if I bring them 10 items, I'm lucky if they take one.  \n\nThey need to figure out a way to improve their line to sell stuff.  I went in last night and there were 6 people already waiting with ONE employee \""buying\"" things.  I knew I actually wanted to look at clothes before I had to make dinner, so I threw my bag of stuff I wanted to sell in the car and just went inside to shop.  They need some kind of number system where I can shop AND still have my place in line. \n\n*pours a forty for the \""old\"" Buffalo*"
0,"I'm with the reviewer from 1-4.  I've been shopping at BE since i was a kid in the 70's and after yesterday, I'm done.  I went in on Saturday and spent a couple hours, purchasing over $200 of clothes. Turns out one of the shirts I bought had 2 huge holes down the middle of the back, unsewable and totally unwearable.  I went back Sunday to see if I could return it for store credit and to trade in several bags of my old clothing.  Long story short; one of the managers gave me a really hard time about returning the shirt, as it had been half off, and she treated me like a total jerk for asking her to work with me, and acted like she was doing me the biggest favor in the world by accepting the return.  She was pretty snotty and rude.  THEN, when it was my turn to trade, a nice guy began helping me, and had accepted a couple of my things, and things seemed fine.  Said manager showed up, elbowed the guy out of the way, and began going through my items herself.  She purchased ONE item out of several large bags and sent me on my way.  It was an incredible blatant FU to me for \""forcing her hand\"" when it came to my return.  What grade are we in again?  I am still amazed that this even happened.  What a great manager!  I bet her employees really enjoy working for her.  It's too bad, I found lots of clothes I loved, but I'll stick to other businesses, like My Sister's Closet and whatnot, where the employees are nice and don't sell clothes that can't be worn."
0,"I'm writing this review purely as a seller. \n\nSo I am a total shopaholic!  I guess that's what happens when you work in the industry.  Anyways, I cleaned out my closet and came here and they literally took 1 pair of jeans out of maybe 40-50 items.  I mostly brought in some old work clothes from Banana Republic and just some odds and ends that no longer fit.  This place is solely for indy/punky/trendy, which they do make quite clear so they are what they say they are which is good.  Makes me kind of wonder how many people buy and sell back the same items though..."
4,"It's pricey, but you're investing in quality products and garments. I've been here twice while in Phoenix, and have ordered some products online. They carry great names, and have some solid styles. Most importantly, the guys working there are sincere and patient. You're never pressured to purchase, but you're likely to walk out with something."
3,"I realized my faux pas with the last review.  Downtown Phoenix is the black hole of convenient delivery pizza.  Yes, there is Pizzeria Bianco but I have yet to find the time, motivation, and dinner companions to accompany me on a 3 hour wait for pizza.\n\nSo, we usually order from Domino's.  Partially because their Brooklyn style is pretty good and partially because ordering reminds me of a blog that had me laughing/giggling/snorting for hours: http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000707.php.  I occasionally find ridiculous stuff way funnier than most people would, and the thought of beef nuggets without footing is making me laugh at this very moment.\n\n*wipes tears from eyes and takes a minute to calm down*\n\nSo the ordering is incredibly easy once I stop laughing about whether or not I want the toppings on the right or the left.  And they have the \""Pizza Tracker\"" which tells you what stage your pizza is in and who is completing the task.  I have to say that Wade has done a damn fine job and I'm disappointed if we order on a night that he isn't working.  Not because other Domino's employees mess it up, we have just become fond of seeing his name.\n\nDomino's no longer has the policy of delivering in less than 30 minutes or your pizza is free, but they do come damn close.  Our pizza is almost always here in a half hour (another joy of the pizza tracker).\n\nMy only recommendation is to never order the baked dessert thingies; they always taste like garlic because they're made in the same oven."
2,"If you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy a romantic meal, this is a great place. This is not a kid-friendly place to eat , nor a place you want to bring a loud friend, as everyone in the room will be involved in the conversation. (We all have one of those loud friends - you know what I'm talking about!)\n\nI love the attentive personal service - the owner was our server, and he was so nice! I gave it three stars because most of the food sounded better on the menu than it tasted,  but the cozy environment makes up for that a bit. If I were going to just sit there and not eat, I would have given the place four stars.\n\nI was one of the friends that had lunch with Camille H. She covered the food well, so just read thru her review for food details."
3,"Unique food, great atmosphere, pricey but worth a trip for special occasions."
3,"My sister and I headed to Coup Des Tartes to use her Groupon before it expired. She had been before and loved it, so I was excited to finally see what all the fuss was about! \n\nFirst of all, I just want to throw out there that I don't at all understand the name of the restaurant. From what I can recall from European History, a coup is a military overthrow. So... we're trying to overthrow the tarts? \n\nAnyways, I'm glad that we got here early, because even on a Wednesday, the place filled up pretty quickly. We were able to be seated right away despite not having a reservation, but that could be because we arrived about 10 minutes after it opened for dinner. There are not many tables inside, so it'd be pretty difficult if you had a large group, but the whole place has a very cozy feel. Unfortunately, there are probably less than a dozen parking spaces out front, so I'm not sure where you would park once those filled up.\n\nThe food came out pretty quickly, and my sister had the lamb shank ($24) while I had the salmon ($28). Her lamb shank came out on a bed of cous cous with assorted vegetables on the side. It was tasty, but a little on the salty side. My salmon came with spinach and basmati rice, topped with a green olive salsa and pesto on the side. I don't usually like green olives, but it went well with the fish, though the salmon was cooked a bit more than I would prefer. The rest of the dish was well seasoned, but the salsa was a bit salty. Both dishes came in pretty big portions, and went great with their housemade mint iced tea. \n\nEven though we were pretty full already, we figured that we couldn't leave without having some dessert! We had the chocolate peanut butter tart, which was great, but way too rich after our entrees. It was more chocolatey than peanut-butter-y, and not too sweet. We each only took a few bites, but luckily we got a box to take it home, and it was every bit as good the next day."
2,"While Ajo Al's easily holds the crown for most bearable tex-mex food in town, imho, I still am a far cry from a big fan of here. \n\nOne of my best friends LOVES this place. LOVES it. And I could never figure out why, but I have since turned him onto El Molino in Scottsdale and I haven't heard much about Ajo Al's lately, so maybe he just didn't know any better.\n\nAlso, I did hear murmurings of trouble with health code violations here a few months back. Those usually don't scare me too much, in all candor, since perfectly good restarants get the whistle blown on them for relatively minor infractions so often that I've grown somewhat callous to their warnings. \n\nFurther, I'm sure any problem that once existed is now long gone since there was some press about the incident when it happened. \n\nA good after work place to grab a drink or watch the game with friends, but do yourself a favor and grab some authentic mexican that us Phoenicians are blessed with when it comes time to eat."
3,Shrimp Tacos Morongos.  There may be no better shrimp taco on this side of the border.
4,THANK YOU TOY BOX!!\nI took my car to the Toy Box to have them take a second look at $800 worth of work - strut replacement - that another valley mechanic had quoted me.  Turns out there was nothing wrong with my struts and they saved me $800!!  Their honesty and integrity will be remembered and they have gained a customer for life!  Thanks again Phill and crew...you guys are the best!!
0,when you walk in its old school which is cool and the outside is cool but the food was medioca just a bit i would not give the a second shot now a different location maybe...
1,"Decent for the money, but not spectacular. Wings were overcooked and dry. \n\nThe western bacon burger was decent. Bread was good."
2,The wings here are amazing. Other menu items like onion rings or fried mushrooms... not so amazing. This place has character. You feel like you need a tetanus shot after you leave. The staff are friendly and most likely prison parolees. Get your order to go and you'll be happy. There be strange people that frequent this place.
3,"Why hadn't I thought of Smart & Final before when we've hosted parties?\n\nThey sell in quantities large enough to handle a good sized crowd without going overboard.\n\nThe layout is simple and clean. It was organized the day I went in, and the staff are quite pleasant. I'll have to keep this place in mind for our next party and Thanksgiving, and New Years. And Valentine's Day. Oh, and don't forget about Earth Day!"
3,"3.5. It was very quiet when we went, no dancers or band. The food and service were great- the one exception being the salad. It had too much dressing. The feta was delish- very subtle. \nI had the moussaka- it was very tasty! Decent portions size, along with potatoes and vegetables. They are not stingy with the bread either, which is a rarity. My companion had the chicken with lemon and artichoke, it was good, but I preferred my moussaka.\nWould I go back? Absolutely. But next time, Id like to see the dancers!"
4,"Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)"
0,"FINALLY! Moving out from Biltmore apartments after the WORST customer service from office staff and maintenance. I still have a gapping hole in my ceiling after the staff tried to spackle over the wet hole several times! The apartment smells of mildew, I see mold growing on the frame of the closet where they replaced the carpet but didn't fix the leak. Several of my neighbors have had leaks as well as a lot of downstairs apartments are vacant and windows fogged up from water problems. The hole has gotten worse the last few weeks because they turn off the AC chiller not real AC to migrate to heat... While the weather in AZ is still high 70s the mild has gotten worse and the hole bigger because of stagnant air. I turned in. Vacate notice with my complaints and still have yet to hear from the office to alleviate my situation. Horrible place do not rent!!"
4,"My usual stylist Marina and my backup Suzie weren't there when I came in so I took a chance on Diem-Thuy (aka Christina). I didn't have to worry, she did a GREAT job! She knew exactly how to cut my hair and she was so nice and professional. So, if Marina is your usual stylist and she isn't there don't be afraid to try Christina!"
3,It's not the easiest place to find your way around but Robert was EXtremely helpful!! my experience a little more pleasant.
4,"We had a problem with the way a poster was mounted for framing at another Michael's location and took it to the nearest location to us on East Camelback. We spoke with Shane , the manager of the framing section. He was very polite and helpful. He had us leave the framed print for remounting and personally handled the work the next day at no charge. We couldn't be happier with the quality of the work and the way in which we were treated."
0,"The customer service at this michaels is just plain horrible.\nThe bad\nMe and my girl frequent michaels, she for her crochet needs and me for my shoe paints. I never really ask for help unless I am completely lost I'm usually ok with getting lost. The times I have asked I have not been met with kind responses but I just let it roll off my back, this last time was different me and my gf received and email coupon for 50% off for Halloween promo my girl needed more yarn so we decided to both go and I would use my coupon for an extra yarn for her. After we were done shopping and ready to pay I noticed everyone was using a coupon the gentleman who was working cash register seemed very nice to other customers as soon as I came up and asked him how he was his mood changed he did not answer my question and asked if that was all I said yes sir and I showed him my coupon he said oh another one, I just laughed it off like ok. After I finished and he was giving me my yarn in no bag I said thank you again he ignored me, I snapped I said your welcome that's what u say after someone thanks you or at least acknowledge me! I know I scared him as he started nervously laughing and saying sorry I just walked out shaking my head. I won't go back to this Michaels and I won't shop without a coupon again. I did call and leave bad review on both of our receipts and I think I am going to call the manager as well real lame customer service should always be called out."
1,I went here tonight after hearing good things about the place. I was very disappointed. The food servings were large but the food itself was not very good. The Chicken Fried Steak had no real taste at all. It was just bland. The pork chops were good but not great. Salad just a salad and the bread was cold. I do not think I will be going back after spending $46 dollars for so-so food. Very disappointing.
4,THey have the best chicken fried steak that I have ever had!!! There daily specials are amazing as well!!
1,"Maybe I should have got the chicken fried steak.  Because that steak I had was something else.  There was so much grease piled on top of my t-bone that I'm pretty sure I'm a likely candidate for the world's youngest triple bypass patient.  I'll admit, sometimes grease makes for good grubbin'.  But not this time.\n\nI went on a Saturday night and there was a little bit of a wait. But our server was plenty kind.  She completely forgot our order of fried okra, but I wasn't feeling too upset about it."
0,"Hmmmm.... Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?\n\nIf you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.\n\nWow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.\n\nJust 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.\n\nSo we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....\n\nOrders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.\n\nChicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.\n\nBBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.\n \nThe food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.\n\nGo grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer."
2,"Got a chance to check out Texaz grill finally. Wifey has been beggin me to go here forever and I finally caved. Not sure why, I friggin love chicken fried steak. I perused the menu, but already knew I was going for the go-to dish. we also started with an order of the fried okra. Wifey got the special, which was chicken and dumplings. Little man ordered a cheeseburger. The okra was awesome! tender, perfectly seasoned and just the way fried okra should be. My chicken fried steak was HUGE, like the size of my face. Now bigger isn't always better. The steak was just okay. Somehow with all the gravy, it ws pretty bland. The steak part tasted more like liver and the breading was a bit doughy. I wasn't blown away by my meal but it doesn't matter, it was still a good experience. the service was great, prices cheap and we didn't have to drive very far. Will I go back? probably not, but definitely glad we finally checked it out."
0,"I'm a transplanted Texas girl from Austin. I was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place. The atmosphere is great, the waitress was amusingly surly. Sadly the food was terrible. I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this, and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.   \n\nI advise they add salt & pepper at the least."
4,"Best chicken fried steak bar none in Phoenix.  I come here only for that but the fresh lemonade rocks here too.  The atmosphere is VERY casual and VERY country.  I cant stand country music but its worth it for this place.  It is also a pretty inexpensive place for a good steak if you are looking.  Service is always good, parking is what really sucks here but if you go when there is not a big rush you will be okay."
2,"The only reason I am giving this place a 3 star review is because the service was excellent. The waitress was very friendly and gave us the perfect mix of attention and privacy. We were seated quickly, and had drinks a few minutes later. The food arrived equally fast.\n\nThe restaurant itself is your typical roadhouse. Its dark and a bit crowded feeling inside, with lots of stuff on the walls, and feels dirty, even though I'm sure it's clean. Prices were reasonable, especially considering the huge portions of food. I ordered their \""famous\"" Chicken fried steak. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but what I got was not what I was hoping for. the breading on the chicken wasn't very crispy and had very little flavor. The gravy had even less flavor than the batter and only succeeded in making everything soggy. The steak itself was cooked well but fatty, flavorless, and hard to cut. the salads and side dishes were equally mediocre. \n\nNothing special about TexAZ Grill."
4,"Being a Texas Native and foodie. This place is legit. Being my first time here thanks to a Yelp search for chicken fried steak this was on top of the list, I had to check it out. Seeing the decor on the wall I had to make a Texas License Plate donation because after two years of being here I finally caved in and registered my car in AZ and coincidentally had it in my trunk. This donation yielded the opportunity to meet Steve the owner. Steve was awesome we chatted about Tex-Mex food and life in Texas. It was delightful meeting him. \n\nNow on to the food. We ordered a dish on their daily special of biscuits topped with a chicken fried steak topped with eggs. This may sound weird but that's how you eat them in Texas. Food was killer. Steve was also generous in bringing us a sample of his BBQ brisket and mash potatoes. Again legit Texas style food. As BBQ competition person whose tasted some of the best BBQ in Texas I have to give two thumbs up, all the food had great flavor. And we even tried the cobbler topped with Bluebell ice cream. Which if it had anything other than Bluebell than that would be a sin. \n\nWe will be back to try other menu items and next time go with a bigger appetite."
3,"The filet here is awesome at only $22 (with fries, a salad, and biscuits and bread). Additionally, there is great Texas stuff all over the walls, with a definite focus on the Big Bend (Marfa, Terlingua, etc.) and Gulf Coast regions. Good weeknight specials, but I have not tried weekend brunch yet. I've been here about 3 times. It's a real chicken fried steak kind of place, so don't bring a woman here unless she's into that kind of thing."
3,"Re: Grooming Salon. Specifically, Katie, the cat handler.\n\nIt is near to impossible to find cat groomers in this town. Some vets offer the service but after today's visit to Petsmart I won't go anywhere else. So the deal is I have a demon cat. Well, she's lovely and adorable with me, but for some reason fears all pet workers. No clue why, nothing bad has ever happened to her. \n\nKatie works Tuesday through Friday and starts at 7am, which I can appreciate because no one else should have to witness the dramatics my cat puts on. I arrived after calling ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches, so as to avoid bits clinging to her backside (gross.)  Katie got an E-collar on Josie and told me she was going to have to scruff her while she worked, which was just fine with me because the cat was screaming like a murder victim and otherwise being embarrassing. In less than ten minutes the job was done (for only $6!) and Josie was back in her carrier like nothing happened. \n\nLook, I had a veterinarian tell me that if I brought Josie in for any grooming they would SEDATE her, and she also recommended I get her declawed, which I believe is inhumane. Maybe Katie considers what she does completely normal and reasonable, but she's the first professional who has worked with Josie...professionally. \n\nI know my cat is a total freak but I can't shave her ass myself, so thank god Katie is at Petsmart. Seriously."
4,"When I first got my puppy she was matted and had a string tied around her tail (whoever had her before had tried to crop it at home, I rescued her). Crystal has taken extra special care of my little girl from day one! My dog loves going to her, she gets so excited to see her. My pup always looks adorable when she comes back home! I always get very detailed report cards from Crystal, which means she's paying attention to my pup's needs. I discuss what's going on with my dog before the groom and Crystal makes awesome suggestions regarding whatever needs my dog has (i.e.. more conditioning in the winter, shorter cut in the summer, even which type of glucose she suggests). I send all my friends with animals to her, and now I'm doing the same with you! Hope your pets are happy and shiny!"
3,"Finally got my Sheltie the other day; trip to PetSmart was unavoidable due to the essentials I needed to get that couldn't wait for online purchase. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised! I'd heard things about the prices - but  apparently there was some sort of sale going on and I was able to gather a plethora of puppy goodies for not a lot of dough. Everything seemed to be one sale! My puppy, needless to say, was very happy with me.\n\nMy one real qualm with this place was that we needed a dog tag, paid for a dog tag, and when we stuck it in the machine for the engraving, it came with a mandatory Petsmart logo. Sure, it may be genius advertising in disguise, but the idea that I'm paying the same thing I would online and Petsmart gets to sneak in a bit of free advertising makes me all snarly, especially when I'm subjecting my new beloved pet to be the billboard. Low blow, Petsmart; low blow.\n\nAside from that, I loved the product selection and the employees were friendly and very helpful. I also kinda dug the pet classes they held here, although I would love to see something more communal and less profit-based in the downtown Phoenix vicinity. Definitely go when they're having their sales; the prices for dog toys had been marked from $7-9 bucks per toy down to $2-4 bucks, and that in my book, is pretty OK."
3,"We stopping in on Friday about 5:00 just to check it out. Harveys is a neighborhood dive. It felt like Cheers when we walked in. People at the bar (customers) said Hi and the waitress was right to us with menus and very friendly. OK, don't expect much in decor. The tables are sticky, like when the varnish is sticky and you can never get it clean enough to not be sticky. We had drinks very nice martinis. The bartender is a pro. I had a BLT, thin sliced bacon, crispy and just the right amount and my partner had a burger, both were excellent. \nAs we left the bar crew all said bye as well as the staff. I liked the folks there."
3,"I'm not a huge bar person, so walking into a dive bar on this side of town was scary.  Was I not with a big strong male, I would have likely not even bothered.  I got a wineburger, onion rings, and beer.  The service was incredibly friendly and the conversation at the bar was entertaining.  The burger was incredibly flavorful although sort of greasy and the beer and onion rings were average. I would totally go back here (with company) for burgers and the creepy yet surprisingly friendly and entertaining atmosphere."
1,"I'm a thrift store junkie and this particular Goodwill location is just junkie. I've never really been impressed with the finds at this location and it has that stale grandma's dead cat smell when you walk in. That being said, they seem to have an OK selection of older furniture if you're looking for something to fix up or paint. \n\nYou should really go to the one on 20th St. & Indian School if you're in this area. They just built that one about a year and a half ago and it's clean and has great stuff."
0,"Horrible customer service. I'm shocked how they employ people who have such limited vocabulary and no common sense. Horrible attitude from the front girl \""Lucille\"". Showed no effort in helping or listening to anyone. I did see her chuckle away every time she glanced at her phone. I assume her texting or Facebook was much more important than injured people seeking help. The gentleman sitting next to me has a broken finger and he's been sitting here since 11am ( 7 hours ago ). I'm heading to another hospital and giving this gentleman a ride to get seen."
2,"This place is decent. The prices are alright and the menu has a lot more than just sushi. The service has kind of depended on the time of day I have gone. The lunch service has always been pretty good, the dinner service was pretty slow. We waited 30-40 mins for our sushi order. They were pretty busy, but not THAT busy. It is a pretty small place so it can definitely be a little crowded, but it's a cute little place with good sushi."
3,"We got take out from here during a spring break trip. Noodles, sushi, edamame, popcorn shrimp. All delicious. I ate the leftover noodles, cold, for breakfast, the next morning."
2,"We usually go here for their Sunday happy hour. The sushi is good and I've had their bbq pork noodles which have a lot of flavor, but for the most part it's not very authentic. Something different was their sushi ice cream, that was pretty awesome, you cant really go wrong with rice crispy treats and ice cream! The service has been very hit or miss."
3,"Ok, I'm updating my review. I come here far too often not to bump it up another notch. Plus, now I don't have to worry about someone calling me out when I stop by for my favorite chicken salad. Honestly, this is probably the best bang for your buck HH around. Who doesn't appreciate cheap and delicious food? Obviously, past Morgan didn't."
0,"Ordered two bowls of noodle with the wife.  An hour after walking in the door, we still didn't have noodles.  \n\nThe waitress walked by 6 or seven times and was avoiding making eye contact.  Finally we had to leave to pick up our kids, not having eaten, not having had any sort of good service.  The waitress couldn't fathom why we would leave after having already been there about an hour.\n\nI have eaten here before and it has decent food but I won't be wasting anymore of my time here.  The complete lack of an attempt at service or even acknowledging the lack of it is inexcusable in a service industry with so many options.\n\nHana has better Sushi/Japanese and is very near by on 7th ave."
4,love love moto fresh fish cool atmosphere must try this hip mod place.  The noodles are out of this world and the sushi is the best in this part of town. Be prepared for a long wait this place is popular.
3,"This Starbucks is a bigger place than the ones I normally go to.  And everyone there has a laptop, ipad, or holding something electronic.  I felt the need to take out my cell phone and hold it.  he he he...  Everyone (customers and employees) are friendly.  They got the order spot on.  \n\nWhen we were leaving there was a GOOD dog sitting by the door with his leash not tied to anything just waiting for his owner.  Awwwwww...."
4,"I have been to a lot of Starbucks and I thought this Starbucks was really clean and it was pretty big inside too.  This year I got a free drink for my birthday.  I was pretty excited about it, because Starbucks is one of my favorite places to go for coffee.  So, when I went up to order my Chocolate Cookie Crumble Frappuccino.  The cashier was really friendly and wrote Happy 30th Birthday Amy on my cup."
1,"I like World Market just fine, but had an unpleasant experience at this particular location the other day.\n\nThere was a display on the floor  full of throw pillows, and it was clearly marked \""50% off\"" and \""clearance\"" in multiple spots around the entire display.  Obviously, leading one to think that all the pillows in that display were part of the sale.  So I picked out two, went to check out, and they rang up full price.  I informed the girl at the register that they were marked half-off...she was nice enough, but she wouldn't honor the mistake - most other stores will.  \n\nFine, not a huge deal, but then some guy off the floor comes over, and very rudely snaps at me, \""No, you're wrong, those ones weren't marked.  Only (name) ones are.\"" \n\n\""Um...yes, they were. I was just there.  It says clearance right above them.\"" \n\nFor some reason, he felt the need to keep fighting me on it.  Very annoying and embarrassing to have to be dragged into this argument in front of a line of people.  He's SO sure that he's right that he asks me to waste my time to follow him back to the display, so he can show me himself and prove that I'm wrong.  So I humor him, walk back, and show him the large, red clearance sign directly above the pillows I had wanted to purchase.  By now, if I were in his shoes, I'd be feeling like a real piece of work.  But no, not this guy.  Not only did he NEVER apologize, but he would not admit that he was at fault.  Instead, all I got was a half-assed mumble, \""Well, it's wrong...\""\n\nIrritated by now, I decided to not purchase the pillows and started to walk away.  As soon as I turned away from him, the guy calls over another girl that was working there - who had nothing to do with the whole  fiasco - and he starts yelling at her in front of everyone within earshot, blaming her for putting the sign there.  Essentially, pushing his responsibility off on someone else so he won't have to admit fault.\n\n I won't be going to this location anymore, courtesy of this guy who acts like a 12 year old."
0,"I usually only buy beauty products at a department store or Sephora but ULTA is a lot closer, I run there when I'm in a jam.  I would consider the shopping experience here a small step up from Walgreens.  It has the necessities but not the items you never knew you needed.  Very small selection of brand named make-up, skin care and perfumes.  Over priced hair care and hair accessories.  I'm always bummed out when I walk around.\n\nAs for the staff, can't stand them.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by other places that like to tell you what's new, which items come with gifts or help you pick a color.  Nope, not ULTA.  There's usually ONE girl working the register, no matter how big the line.  The rest of the staff is coagulated by this counter in between the make-up and hair salon.  I have no idea what purpose that counter serves because they're all clustered around it, putting make-up on each other and gossiping about the girl at the register - you know, the one actually working.  The one time I did actually pull one away to ask for help with liquid eye liner she handed me one of those pencil eyeliners that don't need to be sharpened.  Ugh, thanks for nuthin'."
3,"I didn't get ANY service at the Indian Bend store. And I do have to complain that in the past the totally fake \""Welcome to Ulta!\"" got on my nerves. Wasn't comfortable in Tempe Marketplace store either. Made a trip to the Camelback store. Only waited a minute for ROCHELLE to help me. Awesome! Personable, professional, enthusiastic, knew her stuff! Bought everything she recommended. WOW. What a difference she made. Worth the drive anytime."
0,"Wow...I can't believe the rave reviews this joint gets!!! I am FAR from impressed...Hot giardenara? Is that what they called those pickled jalapenos they put on their sandwich?! NO WAY If you want authentic Italian Beef catch a flight to ORD and go to Portillo's or Gene and Jude's...\nThis place is sub-par at best! If you're looking for something remotely close to Chicago Italian Beef in Arizona, go to Tom's BBQ or Lobby's on Southern and McClintock...This place doesn't live up to the hype!  Don't waste your time! People who love it must not be from Chicago..."
1,"Meat has decreased in quality over last couple of years. Lukes, step up your game."
3,"I've lived in the neighborhood for a long time - and I've been to Luke's sporadically over the years. No good reason I don't go regularly - the food is always exactly what I expect and the prices are fair.\nI seem to stick with the Italian beef - but the menu also covers hot dogs, hamburgers, subs and Italian Sausage. (I will have to try sausage, peppers and onions with red sauce at some point - one of my ultimate comfort foods- to see if they're as good as Guido's in Scottsdale.)\nThe beef is juicy, shaved thin - and works perfectly with the giardinera and hoagie roll. \n\nFor those nights when I just need a mouthful of hot meat, Luke is my go-to guy! So happy I can satiate the craving right around the corner from home!"
2,"What a throw back to the 50's! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner always avail 24 hours a day. I like this place very much. The decor takes you back to the 50's with its table top jukeboxes.  The menu is large anything from breakfast to salads, burgers, and good chicken fried steak. You can also try one of their old fashion milk shakes. The service is always good never had a bad day here. They have whatever you want anytime of day you would like it. If you happen to be their in the morning ask for becky. She always singing a tune."
0,"Not a very good place at all.  Be very careful of this place as they tack on all kinds of move-out charges.  They make you show a receipt that the apartment has been \""professionally cleaned\"" when move out.  I had my neighbor clean the place as she did an exceptional job.  Because she is not a registered cleaning company, they charged me $130 for not having a registered company clean the apartment.  Also, make sure that you pay rent before the first of the month if it falls on a holiday.  They charged me $75 for not paying them on time because they were closed on the first of the month.  Because they decided to close on the first, they charged other tenants and I $75 for supposedly paying late.  Be very careful if you decide to live at this apartment complex."
0,"I'm sure they can provide excellent service.  However, i had my breaks changed and it put me out $700.  I thought that was high for changing the breaks and smoothing the rotors. Apparently all the bolts weren't tightened up when they gave it back so i had to return back the next day so they could fix the wobbly wheel.\n\nMaybe that was a small oversight, but before going here you should definitely shop around.  I was quoted $1400 for a timing belt change so i decided to forgo the service and shop around and received excellent service for hundreds less. So if it's not a critical need, shop around and know the market rate."
4,Great service and prices. This is where I buy my water because its the cheapest in phoenix (even the Catalina). Fish are also healthy
1,"Ate there for Valentine's dinner.  Too expensive.  Portions very tiny.  No bread.  Salad was tasty enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed Greek salad.---I'm not kidding.\n\n  My dish was salmon.  The fish was cold and the sauce was congealing.  Had to send it back for reheat.  My Valentine's was sword fish, which consisted of about 3 one inch square pieces. Also cold. \nNo bread, no Pita bread.  The sword fish was about $24, and the salmon, about that much, too.  The wine list was all Greek wine, and the glasses the wine was served in were like little toy glasses, not real wine glasses.  Our waiter was kind of lackadaisical.  \nThere were food splatters on the white wall next to the table.\n\nWhen a short woman made rounds about the tables to ask how we liked our food, we didn't  trust ourselves to even get started, and mumbled, \""thank you.\""  All the \""Best of Phoenix\"" favorable reviews were at least 10- 20 years old.\nThe bathroom had toilet paper stuck to the wet floor of one stall, and the toilet installed inches from the side wall in the other stall.  Weird.  There was a table with chairs outside the bathroom, like they seated overflow guests there.  Weird.\nWe vowed never to go back, and remembered maybe that's why we hadn't been there for years.  Better to eat at Crazy Jim's or Greek Town. \nSave your money."
4,"I'm the girly girly-ist tom boy you'll ever meet. Sitting through an hour of getting my nails done is pure hell to me. Pedicures are not \""relaxation time\"" for me, it's \""pain in the ass time\"".  I hate getting my hair done and I can't stand shopping. I'd rather be out drinking whiskey and shooting pool. All of this is very difficult for me you understand, because at the same time I like to be pretty. This is where DV comes in to save the day (or at least my hands and feet)  \n\nLe is my nail tech. I ONLY go to her though I can say I've had pedi's from some of the other ladies and they're all quite thorough. I'm insanely picky about my nails. It borders on OCD (no joke). Le is extremely detail oriented and my nails turn out perfect every time. It's always packed in there and that is a testament to quality of product if you ask me. The prices are comparable to anywhere else you might go though I don't recommend going anywhere else. It's close to home and afterward I can make a quick run over to Old Navy (one of the few places I can stomach shopping) \nIt's still a pain in the ass.... the whole damn thing... but at least my fingers and toes look cute. (god, that was the most stupid \""chick\"" thing that has ever come out of my mouth) \nI'm glad I could share it with you."
3,"I've gotten several very nice pedicures at DV.  The place isn't fancy but it's clean, the staff is friendly, and they offer good prices."
1,"Einstein's is an okay chain.  It's not my favorite but in a pinch, it can hit the spot.  This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  I've stopped in multiple times due to the convenient location but I always leave disappointed.  \n\nThe food here is the standard Einstein's fare.  I'm not a real bagel fan but I have sampled a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  They were okay, nothing memorable.  I usually stop in for a coffee or a latte.\n\nThis last visit really made me mad.  I ordered a hot chai latte and ended up leaving with something else (never figured out what the drink was).  Unfortunately, I was a good ways down the road before the drink had cooled enough for me to take a sip.  Aaargh!\n\nWhat really annoys me about this location is the lack of customer service.  I've found that the folks working behind the counter are rather gruff and unfriendly. On this last visit, the young lady didn't greet me and refused to look me in the eye.  It's been a similar story with my previous visits.  The store seems to stay fairly busy in the morning hours.  I don't know if this contributes to the service problem or not.  Either way, I've made my final visit.  I can get a hot drink elsewhere."
2,"The New York Sirloin was cooked well, but it was pretty tough. The online menu said they had prime rib, which is why we came, but they don't even sell it. Our server Bryan was very good"
2,"Okay place.  Like the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  Food is mediocre.  Service okay to good.  I've been here a half a dozen times and think it's consistently okay.  I'm yet to find a mexican food restaurant I really like (for dinner, not a dive)."
2,"I've been going there since it opened in the mid-90's and was called the Andale' restaurant. I think they changed the name because too many people made the same mistake my sister (who took 3 years of Spanish in high school and college) did: She asked why the hell anyone would call a Mexican restaurant the \""Ann-Dayle\"". And so it goes.\n\nI've enjoyed most of what I've had there. Not the place to go while on a diet. Everything tends to be cheese-heavy. Partially for that reason I would forgo the sour cream and guac that they offer, especially considering that they come at a total extra cost of something like $3.50 or whatever. Sometimes the wait staff tells you, other times not. Guess it depends if they've been threatened with tableware when an unsuspecting customer wonders how the bill for a table of four suddenly jumped by FIFTEEN DOLLARS for guac and sour cream.\n\nIt's an ok place with reliable quality and decent atmosphere. The chicken con queso is good, but I prefer the adobada plate."
1,"To be honest I was fairly disappointed with Aribas. People had given me mixed reviews prior to me going there and it seemed either people really liked it or weren't impressed at all; and upon going there myself I could see why. At first I was shocked and ecstatic by their dollar margarita special during happy hour, however when we got our drinks you could barely taste any tequila (although they were only a dollar, it literally felt like I was drinking flavored water). The chips and salsa at the table were awesome (probably the best part of eating there). I ordered enchiladas which were pretty undercooked and didn't really have much flavor outside of the melted cheese. My friends got the spicy chicken entree and a chimichanga. The spicy chicken was ridiculously spicy and not very good; the chimichanga was pretty good however but nothing special. Out waitress seemed very aloof the whole time we were there and the one thing that bothered me the most was a small side of sour cream was $1.99!!!!! despite the meals being pricey to begin with."
3,"Went here several weeks ago. My one complaint is that it is TOO dark. The food was okay, nothing special. The staff was wonderful and very attentive."
3,"It had been years since I had been to PCG; but my friends Rich & Corey said lets go there.  Decided to try brunch today.  I had the   Stacked Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas thought it might be like chilaquiles - but it was very delicious!!!  The price is very reasonable.  My friends both had Smoked Salmon Benedicts - they looked very yummy.  Also, really crave crab cakes; but haven't found a place to that serves them well. Might have to try them the next time.  A very good Sunday, will definately be back!!!"
3,"What a pleasant surprise.  I selected PCG for a business dinner this week and all of us were thrilled with the meal, atmosphere and service. I tried the plank salmon which was wonderful.  Two of us had meals that included the mashed potatoes with horseradish and agreed the flavor was excellent.  I admit that as I approached the strip center on 16th street I wondered if I had made a mistake, only to be rewarded by my guests with compliments for the choice. I will return."
2,"The appetizers were very good. I enjoyed the much raved about \""Griddled Corn Cakes\"" The queso was also unique and delicious.\n\nThe butter lettuce wedge salad was so delicious. They even chopped it for me to make it easier to eat.\n\nThe pork tenderloin was so tender and moist. I\""m not a huge fan of this dish in general, but they made me a fan.\n\nThey keep things interesting by having specials daily.\n\nThe servers seemed very novice. They did not remember drink orders, I found it unusual they would walk away then come right back and ask again what we said.\n\nWent on a Monday Night at 730pm. It was definitely still active at that time. I imagine weekends must be crazy.\n\nThe food and atmosphere was excellent, I was a little disappointed in the service. Otherwise would have given 4 stars."
1,I have always enjoyed dinner with friends at Phoenix City Grille. I had never tried Happy Hour there so a friend and I decided to give it a try. We sat for almost 10 minute at bar before we were asked if we'd like a drink. The Green Chile Queso Fundido was quite tasty. We intended to order a few other items but We had to pry the bartenders to return for refills and food that we decided to leave and continue Happy Hour elsewhere. Keep you posted on our return to PCG...
4,"Loved.This.Place. Awesome candlelit ambience, spacious seating options, and friendly service.  Well-sorted menu with vegetarian and seafood options (yay me). Deschutes Brewery Porter. Affordable price point."
3,"Impulse shopping for electronic equipment is a horrible habit to have.  Sadly, it's a habit I can't kick.\n\nIt starts off as a tiny nagging thought in my head.  \""I'd go to the gym more if I had an MP3 player.\""  Now, this being a perfectly reasonable thought, I head off to Best Buy.  The trouble starts when I actually walk through the doors.  My iPod was the gateway drug and Best Buy was dealing.\n\nOver the last several months I've purchased home networking devices, home entertainment stuff, computer hardware and a whole mess of movies.  The sales crew has been competent and able to answer the few questions that I had.\n\nThe prices for big ticket items are adequate bordering on good, depending on sales.  Movies aren't cheap, but the selection is great.  \n\nThough there are better bargains out there, Best Buy will always be my go to spot for must have items.  Damn enablers..."
0,"greeter which is basically security was the coolest dude there, they have hardly any wireless routers and when you ask somebody a question they are always in a hurry to get away from you to go on break i would not return to this location at all"
1,"I went here when I dropped my iPhone (tragedy...) and broke the speaker. I could hear my callers, but they couldn't hear me. I went in to Best Buy to see if I could just buy one of those cheap pay-as-you-go phones, because I had some urgent business calls to make, and had planned to be running around town all day. I looked around with a customer service rep, who was in fact friendly. But after some wasted time, we came to the conclusion that they had nothing to offer me.  In short, I have no problem with the customer service at this location. But I wish such a big chain would not forget to supply their stores with the simple/affordable options. This could be my old fashioned preference, but if I want to by a non-color screen flip phone, I'd hope I could find it at one of the biggest electronic stores in the nation."
4,Brought my Yorkie in and they did an amazing job! Making my next appointment now. They clipped his nails bathed and cut and even cleaned his ears. This was one of the best experiences I have had at a groomers and I highly recommend them!
1,This was the first groomer we tried out in the Phoenix area. They had good reviews on yelp and good prices so we gave them a try. I was not impressed and left really missing our groomer back in CA. I asked for my dog's tail to get special attention. She was given back to me with matts still in her tail and her face hadn't been cleaned thoroughly. Pretty disappointed will not be returning.
0,"Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed. I wanted to take the truck back but I was pretty soured on the lack of care for the work that was done. I will keep looking for a mechanic that gives me more bang for my buck."
4,"Pam & Nibblers saved me!  Last minute office luncheon and they were able to put together a great menu. Prompt service and set-up, with everything you need and/or can think of.  (try the grilled veggies, flank steak ...everything.!!)"
4,"Regi B. \n\nRegi  you placed a review on yelp stating bad customer service and you never had any business dealings with us. You had a car accident with one of our contractors and YOU did not have insurance, This is your 3rd accident without insurance and you still manage to maintain a legal drivers license( amazing). You then decide to take legal action against the person you hit. You are one of the reasons that the legal system is filled with frivolous lawsuits. Just another example of someone looking for something for nothing."
3,This Starbucks closes late so that's the upside it has a cool patio and the inside is nice just the one thing I have to complain about is the Internet it sucks but I you come here for anything else it's all good.
4,Have always enjoyed going here. Been going here for a few years.\n\nWent for a haircut today. Same great service. \n\nThey get you in and out in a hurry but I've never had a bad haircut here.\n\nLove the hot towel and shave of the nape of your neck at the end.\n\nIf you really want to pamper yourself sometime let them give you a straight razor shave. I've gotten them a few times and each time I've almost fallen asleep. Very relaxing.\n\nAnd like previous reviewers have noticed they are foreign but I've never had any problems getting across what I want.\n\nHighly recommended.
0,"I really don't even know where to start with this place.  I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was.  That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.  The decor in this place is cluttered, old, and feels dirty.  They sell most of their \""decorations\"" and if you are looking for a basket from 1984 you will surely find one. The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.  I don't find that particularly appetizing.  \n\nSo I figured, this place must make one hell of a sandwich to keep such a high reputation, and placed my order.  While very nice, the staff is s...l...o...w...  \n\nI ordered the briesciutto.  I figured brie, prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes - can't mess that up, right?  Wrong.  The French bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread.  The sun dried tomatoes were huge, but overpowered everything else.  I couldn't taste the brie or the prosciutto.     For what I paid and what I've heard, I had expected much better.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience.\n\nMy overall recommendation: just go across the parking lot to Einstein's."
3,"This might surprise you, but this place doesn't have servers. I was expecting a sit-down-and-order experience, but was wrong and I've talked to others who've thought the same thing (there are places to sit it's just more like a deli than a restaurant). Still, that shouldn't put you off...they make great sandwiches and on Mondays they have GREAT lunch specials!\n\nSometimes there is live music, which is real nice (especially if the performer is attractive and sometimes they are).\n\nWhen I go I usually order the Avacado Sandwich or the Briesciutto."
4,"Went here for a friends birthday. They have a nice outside patio. That you can reserve. Great options for sandwiches & wine. I absolutely love these types of places where it's a deli but also a great little shop with crazy jams, sauces, teas & cookwares."
1,"15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.\n\nThere are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again."
0,"If I could give them minus 100 stars, I would do so. \nMy partner and I live in Central Phoenix and had friends from San Diego in for a visit last weekend.  After showing them around town on Sunday, Dec. 29th we were all hungry around 1pm. With the numerous dining options in Central Phoenix we decided to go to the Duck and Decanter on E. Camelback.  Friends in town have been raving about that place for years and now this was our opportunity to try it and show our friends a good time.  We arrived last Sunday a little after 1pm.  Outside was very busy but managed to find a an empty table for the four of us.  I decided to wait at the table to save it as it was the last one available. The others went inside to place our orders. My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great caf\u00e9s in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.  They can keep their lousy service, inedible over priced food and \""cluck it\""."
1,"I like this CVS because it's close to home and open 24 hours. The store itself is alright. I like that they sell booze, most of which is less expensive than Total Wine across the parking lot. The cashiers can be slow but they are usually nice. The problem with this CVS is the pharmacy. They are a little clueless and some techs are just rude. About a month ago I filled a script there and they said it would take an hour. I needed this script ASAP so I killed time in the area. An hour later it wasn't ready. I'd say I waited a little over two hours for this medicine and then when it was finally ready the pharmacist wanted to 'go over it with me' even though I had taken it before. Yeah right.  He told me I need to get off this med ASAP because it is probably one of the worst ones out there. Excuse me? Are you my doctor? No. MInd your own business. Your only job here is to fill my script and tell me how to properly take it, not tell me your opinion. My doctor gave me this for a reason! I was extremely upset at this point and just left. I called a few days later and spoke to the store manager who I believe is named Jason. He took down my name and number and said the district manager was going to call me. This was a couple weeks ago and I've heard nothing. I really hope this pharmacist is not saying these type of things to other customers. This was so incredibly unprofessional and off putting. (I don't remember his name but he has a hook for a hand). If anybody has had a similar experience with this man please call the store manager and let them know! This is not okay!!"
1,"Fish was good, atmosphere stunk, service was incredibly slow, and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis.\n\nAlthough my food was good it took about 15 minutes to order my appetizers while eating at the bar which was almost empty.  Then he completely forgot to let me order an entree.  Meanwhile it took 45 minutes to get my appetizer.  The entree came pretty promptly thereafter though.  \n\nOverall it is good fish and it is very cheap but not sure it is worth it."
2,"I'm all for \""personal service\"", but it can get out of hand in a hurry.\n\nI was here on a Saturday afternoon, admittedly a busier time for any establishment.  The guy who appeared to be the manager, as he was wearing a different outfit than the other employees, greeted me as I walked in.  Including him, there were 4 or 5 employees and each was helping other customers.  So I started walking around, looking at the merchandise.  Not such a great selection, and not such great prices, but better than Sports Chalet (selection, not price).  \n\nLo and behold, I found the same running shoe I had been wearing previously and was already very happy with.  It was $10 more expensive here than where I had originally gotten it 8 months ago, Marathon Sports in Boston.  Interesting, because you'd figure 8 months worth of new styles would have devalued these a bit.\n\nSo I'm an easy sale - 5 minutes to grab my size out of the back and ring me up.  But I had to stand around and wait for someone to help me.  And wait.  And wait.  All of the employees were feigning actually helping customers but were really shooting the shit about topics as far ranging as personal style and Bartlesville, OK.  After patiently standing around for 20 minutes (but quietly staring daggers at the employees), at least 4 other customers entered the store after me.  One of them, as an employee was finally ringing a customer up, ran over to him and asked for help, and he of course started to fit her.  Several of us were angered by the blatant attempt to jump ahead and we all made our anger very well known.  Wouldn't you know it, I finally got someone to fetch me my sized 10.5 Asics out of the back and ring me up.\n\nSo to reiterate - good store, decent selection, ok prices, and if you are a newb that needs that personal attention for a true fitting then you'll get it here.  But they need to have a numbering system like a deli counter to avoid an angry mob.  And if you already know the shoe you want to buy, get it online for a bigger savings (and tax free) and avoid the hassle entirely.\n\nOh, and the parking situation blows."
2,"I've been back here a couple of times and...it's leaving a bit to be desired. They never seem to have my size in the sports bras I want, and the past two times I've been there no employee has offered to help me (yes, I can ask but...if it's your business...then...). \n\nI think I'm gonna hunt around for another place to get my gear."
3,"The outside is a blah building, & the few windows have the blinds drawn.  Once you enter, though, you see a very pleasant, somewhat \""upscale\"" mid-sized restaurant that is quiet, a little dark, & almost full of people at lunchtime (as it should be!).\n\nWhen I entered, a friendly host greeted me, & seated me in a totally comfortable booth.  Right away, my drink appeared, along with a basket of tasty naan bread.\n\nThere was salad, about 10 hot dishes, & a couple of dessert items on hand.  All the food was labeled, & all of it was delicious.  My whole experience at Flavors of India was excellent!  Weekday lunch buffet:  $9.23"
3,"Flavors of India serves up a decent lunch buffet.  I've been there a couple of times though and it seems some days, the food is better than others.  Also, I wish they offered a bit more selection.  I've teetering between a 3 and 4 star but because of the reasonable price and friendly service, I'm bumping up to a 4 star.  I'll have to go again to make a final decision. \n\nSee ya there!"
4,"The all-you-can-eat buffet is the best value in town! I just love the onion bhagis and potato pakoras. I believe there are always at least 2 chicken dishes and a tandoori chicken, the standout was the chicken keema aloo. I'm not a big fan of okra, but what they did with it and onions was very nice and subtle. They also had a squash dish that had nice, firm pieces of yellow squash in a wonderful sauce. This was also the first time I tried their dessert; it was gulab something: perfectly round balls of fried deliciousness in a hot, syrupy goodness. I could just have these for breakfast like pancakes! I didn't even get a chance to try their condiment bar. Trust me, you will leave very full."
0,Food was ok. Service was poor. Saw a roach near our table. Not my choice for a lunch companion!
0,"Did not get too far into the BS. Was on hold for more than 45 mins to make an appointment. Just want to remind you all that this is a \""For-Profit\"" organization. Treat them like you would any business that serves you. They do NOT have any special product or service that warrants such crappy service."
4,"Love the family atmosphere, very welcoming & friendly, excellent service & beautiful quality jewelry!"
4,My wife and I had a great experience at Burland. Trish helped us and made it a great experience.
0,"I called this morning because my USB hard drive is not being recognize by my computer. I asked what it would cost to repair it. I was told to come down and they'd take a look at it. I took the morning off of work and drove 45 mins to their shop on Camelback Rd. I showed up and they didn't even look at it. They said it would cost $200 for the inspection and up to $999 to repair it and they would have to send it to another place that has skilled people and the tools to repair something . \n\nThey could have told me that over the phone and I would have not taken the morning off and drove all the way out there. I was definitely misled today and it cost me time and money. Their name is deceptive also because they cannot repair or recover data. They send it to someone who can. They should be called Data Mailers, or Data Parcel Services. A**holes\n\nI found this program called Get Data Back, it costs $80, but I was able to recover all of the files I wanted from the USB drive. That sure beats $1199 these scoundrels wanted to charge me."
0,"I would NOT reccomend taking your computer to Data Doctors! I hear there is a small privately owned computer shop on 24th St and indian School that gets great reviews. Data Doctors looked over my laptop for 20-30 mins in the store (20th/Camelback) and then the tech told me he would have to send it to the Tempe main lab for full assessment. $100 to take it in and figure out what the problem is. I got a call 3 days later from someone else stating they just recieved my laptop and were going to look at it the next morning, so apparently it takes them 3 days to send my laptop from downtown Phx to downtown Tempe. The next day I got a call saying they basically have no clue what the issue is but that they are going to reinstall windows and see if that takes care of the problem. That will cost me an additional $200 to reinstall windows!! At this point I feel like I am trapped because I have already spent $100 bucks and they have the computer. I reluctantly agree to basically pay $300 to have windows reinstalled in my 2 year old laptop. When will I get it back? How long could that possibly take, right? Well, 3-5 days he says. it will take 3-5 days to reinstall windows into my laptop and that is \""putting it ahead of 30 other computers for me.\"" The guy is now acting like I should feel lucky that he is putting mine ahead of others because otherwise it could take 2 WEEKS?! 2 days later I get a call that it is done and seems to be working just fine. It will be back in the Phoenix store for me to pick up 2 1/2 days later...\nFinally, I get my computer back after 2 weeks and $300. Oh well, at least it is all fixed now, right? WRONG. Now my computer will not connect to my wireless network at home. So I call and talk to my wireless provider for 35 minutes trying this and that and she determines it is my computer that has a problem, not the service. I knew that because the other 4 laptops in the house work fine but I figured maybe it just needed to be reset-up or something. \nI called the Data Doctors store to ask them to help me over the phone with maybe a setting or two. The location I dropped it off at originally has NO RECORD of my laptop ever even coming thru that store and they refer me to call the Tempe lab. I call the Tempe lab and tell two different people my issue before someone decides to help me. They tap into my computer from the lab and look at a few things for 10 minutes and then tell me he thinks it is my wireless connection!! I explain that I have several other computers in the house and that I never had an issue with the wireless component until I got it back from them. He says he does not think it is the computer but I have to take it back to the store to have them try to connect it to their wireless network and go from there...but he does not think it is the computer itself. I have a brand new modem and router.\nWhat a bad experience that still is not over. \nI will never take my computers in to data doctors in the future and I would certainly not reccomend them to anyone else."
1,"Employees are friendly and helpful since this was my first time here. However, I'm writing this review as I'm so bored after waiting for over an hour for my car to be washed and serviced. I will finish this when I get my car back!\n\nSo I just ended up going inside to check on my car, and it has been done for who knows how long. The guy who originally took my car said he would call me when it was done. Obviously that didn't happen since my car was finished and I was waiting for nothing. I read the other reviews while I waited, an they weren't very good. Hmm...I'm not swearing this place off some I live down the street, but I will definitely be more prepared. Remember: watch for your car, don't get huddled to fix scratches on your car, go on Tues, Wed, Thur for an oil change---you get a free wash."
0,"I frequented this establishment years ago, however the quality began to lapse so I moved on. I picked up a groupon a few weeks ago to give them another try.  Well even at the discount it was not worth it.  The service is still lackluster, the quality of the work leaves much to be desired.  I won't be coming back anytime soon."
0,"The second I saw the guy eying my windshield I regretted my decision to go here. Before he could say anything, I nicely said \""Hi - I don't need that fixed, Thanks!\"" and then he waited for me by the door to argue with me about it. Not helping your cause dude. \n\nThese guys are also the \""up-selling KINGS.\"" No thank you, I am not going to pay you $49.99 for a filter I can get at Auto Zone for $15. And that was only ONE of at least seven things they tried to up-sell me on. I am guessing I was also being quoted special \""dumb girl\"" pricing.\n\nI finally get my car back, get inside and leave. When I got back to work I realized that my floor mats were actually DIRTIER than when I brought it in and they barely wiped anything down. There was a screw laying there from where they took my cabin filter out to try and up-sell me, so they didn't even put it back in right. The vacuum job was shabby at best and my windows were still dirty. There are water spots everywhere.\n\nNow, I actually feel the need to take my car somewhere else to be checked to make sure they actually changed the oil. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this Danny's, or any Danny's for that matter. They have really gone downhill over the last few years."
0,"I'm so over this place.  Without fail, it is an unpleasant experience.  The upselling is obnoxious and they a half-assed job."
0,"I'll start off by saying that I've been to Danny's several times before and they've done a (mostly) decent job washing my car, especially for the price. After my last experience I definitely will NOT be bringing my business to Danny's and DO NOT recommend you do either. \n\nAfter I left Danny's (on Highland) I noticed I had a big chunk of paint missing from my drivers-side rear bumper. It looks as though it scrapped up against something. The peel was fresh as all the paint had not peeled off. Admittedly, I had already waited almost 2 hours, after being told it would only be about 35 min for a wash and wax, so I was eager to leave and didn't give the car a full inspection before I left the property. \n\nI went back the next day to let the manager, Chris, know what had happened and he was very dismissive about my claim. This was after waiting almost 25 minutes for him to come to the front desk. According to him, all he knew was that I did it myself and was blaming it on them.... sure dude. I don't have proof that anything happened at Danny's but the fact that they weren't willing to investigate was very bothersome. \n\nMoral of the story we've called corporate and they were again very rude and dismissive. Did I mention they hung up on my wife? I don't expect Danny's to look into it and I don't want them to pay for my repair. Just want people to know this is how they treat their customers. Thanks Bye."
0,If I could give them a lower score I would. Horrible decline in quality of service. Very low morale of employees leading to poor service. Used to be great and I would go there before any other car wash or other service.
0,"What the heck happened here?  I have used this car wash for years and have, for the most part,  been happy with the service.   Today I visited and it was the WORST!  Although there was next to nobody there, I did not get checked in, however when someone pulled in behind me, they got served right away.  I had to get out of my car in order to get someone's attention.   When I walked into the store I was hit in the face with the overpowering smell of Pinesol.  Seriously, you can't clean BEFORE you open?  The car wash was mediocre at best.   Usually the place is packed on a Sunday.   Now I know why it's a ghost town."
0,"I had a fairly decently clean car to begin with,   I brought my car for a few touch ups, my trunk the back shield,  and the grill for bugs, and dash/cup holder area.\n\nMy car was parked for 10 min before I asked when they would notify me it's was complete.  They had a system error, and refused to honor my groupon. I was advised to contact corporate.  After 20 min on hold the girl who answered indicated someone would call me back.  \n\nI asked about my car,  the agent went outside and then came back and indicated it was done. \n\nThe bugs were still all over the grill,  cup holders and dash hadn't been touched,  car was clearly not vacuumed,  neither was the trunk. The service agent immediately went to wiping off the bugs, as I became more and more upset about the poorly rendered car wash.  I went inside and asked for a refund.  A gentleman told me I was just upset because of the groupon. I continued to advise it was the half hearted car wash that had me upset.  To which he continued to rebuttal that I was just upset about the Groupon. \n\nAnother associate took me to the car to find our what was wrong.  I pointed out the various items and he indicated he would fix the situation.  I ended up waiting near the detailing crew, who didn't hide the use of profanity. They we're shouting insults to one another. Not the most professional display,  even for a car wash. \n\nEventually I got my car,  still not vacuumed thoroughly and left.  Safe to say after coming sporadically (as needed) fire 7 years,  I'm fine not coming back to Dannys with the hit and miss service and bad car washes"
0,People are very rude! I was told for an extra $100 when can buff out all the scratches and it would look like a new paint job...no wonder this place has a bad rep!!! I had to give it a rating
4,"I went to Rochelle's Salon once before and hated the girl who did my hair. After about a year later, I slowly got the courage to give Rochelle's Salon another chance, but only for a blow dry and style. We kept dating like this for a while. They referred me to Abel who did a great job and eventually, the relationship progressed and I now trust him to cut my hair and color it. I love Rochelle's and am now a loyal girlfriend. Abel is great, creative, easy-going, and very accommodating as most my appointments are last minute. In addition, he's great at giving dating advice-NOT, but it's hilarious to hear his escapades being a straight hairstylist. Scandelous. Liz at the front desk has a great memory, too!"
0,"My boyfriend and I traveled an hour on Thursday to come to your store based on the reviews and advertising of your business. We ordered two sandwiches, one Italian sub, and one sandwich with mortadella only. We also bought the imported Parmesan Reggiano cheese, a jar of hot cherry peppers, a package of the imported long ziti, 1/2 lb of Hot Capicola and 1/2 lb of Mortadella totaling approximately $80.  We are from NY and have Italian in our blood. We are used to good Italian delis in NY.  Yours doesn't even come close.  I should have realized when there was no smell of cheese when we walked in. The sandwiches were ok, we ate them there. Your store was very clean, not sure if that is due to lack of business or what. When we got home, my boyfriend tried the cheese, he said it was tasteless.  I just made a sandwich with the hot cherry peppers, however, I noticed that the jar cap was popping, which means it's been opened. I tried them anyway and they are tasteless!  Your prices are very high and then to have tasteless cheese and cherry peppers? I told my boyfriend we should come back to your store and demand a refund for the cheese and peppers, which was about $40!  But how much gas are we going to spend traveling back to you?  The proper thing would be to credit his credit card.  Hopefully, you will see this and do that."
2,"Jason B. and I decided to try this place on Saturday night. I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting.\n\nWe started with the Artichoke Croquettes, and the Calamari as well. We were disappointed in the Artichoke Croquettes, you get 4 half Artichokes fried with alternating Marinara and this white sauce. The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special! \n\nI ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.\n\nNot sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldn't say no to going back again!"
2,"Was recommended tp me to try by a co-worker.  Had a \""eh\"" experience.\n\nAn \""eh\"" experience is what you say when recommending the establishment to someone else.  And that sums up my experience.\n\nService had a rocky start...my friend started a tab before I got there and I sat for 15 min waiting for a server before I went to the bar.  Five minutes later a different server came over and had taken over our tab.  So problem solved.\n\nWe had a couple of the 1/2 price apps.  They were good - calamari and potato skins.  Pretty standard stuff.  \n\nOverall, I'll go back for some HH specials but I'm not going to be the one suggesting it to people.  I'll stay up by 16th and Bethany Home instead."
2,"Definitely a cool spot, with a great downstairs bar. The decor upstairs is unique too. Serving Richardson's menu in the meantime, but something is missing when compared to Richardson's. I can't put my finger on it, but I don't get the same feeling. Worth visiting for sure."
4,"Why more [places like this don't exist in AZ, I'll never know.  If you're looking for that old Europe feel, this is an excellent choice.  Although this spot is awesome at any time of the year, I think when the weather turns cooler, this is like a trip to your fantasy of an Olde English Public House.  There is an upstairs restaurant and a downstairs cellar bar. I'll be focusing on the Cellar bar.\n\nDownstairs is amazing. There are/were only a couple bars in PHX that I can think of that were underground and this is one of them. It's swanky, candle-lit, and it has some of the best happy hour specials I've ever experienced. Their \""small plate's\"" are truly some of the finest creations I've ever had for the price.  I would recommend trying them all out eventually, but start with one or two. For $5 during happy hour, they can't be beat.\n\nAs for the drinks, there are two times where you can seriously get your money's worth.  On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday all bottles of wine are 1/2 price.  And they have some excellent wines. The other time is regular happy hour all week from 3-6.  For me, it's all about going on a Sun, Mon or Tues during HH! 1/2 of bottles of wine, cocktail specials AND $5 small plates. I'll call it budget-swank. Excellent experience for not too much money./Art"
1,"Just not all that impressive from our POV..... ambiance was cozy, comfortable and welcoming but service and food ... meh .  The prime rib was good... halibut was not that fresh tasting (disappointing since the \""knowledgeable\"" server suggested it). The green chili potato .... hmmm.  Well, if you think an uncooked, crunchy pepper the size of a jalapeno filled with a couple of tablespoons of paprika laden mashed potatoes is divine ... then you would be in the right place .  Me? Not so much.\n\nThe salad was fine - but then again, you really have to suck to screw up a salad.  The kicker was when I ordered a glass of Chardonnay... then the server returned with a Pinot Noir ....  \n\nWe took a couple from out of town who were here on their anniversary.  I told the host when I called to check on the reservation (I made it thru Open Table) and then told the host again when we arrived.  They did absolutely nothing with this information but yet I saw some other table get the special acknowledgement.  What a disappointment, all around.  \n\nWould I go back?  Dunno.... There are many other places here in the valley that we need to experience prior to ever giving these folks our hard-earned casheroo...."
3,I love the food and it is usually excellent service. I always visit the downstairs cellar bar. It has a hip rustic feel and pretty good tunes on the ipod. One of my faves
3,Wow!  This place is good.  My first time in Phoenix and if I ever get back I'll be sure to dine here.  So should you.  Prego.  (You're welcome.)
2,My go to place has been slipping a little.  The last couple of times I've come the food is either over cooked or under cooked.  The brie & tenderloin toast was over cooked the last 2 times to where the toast was burnt and still served and the bacon on the bacon wrapped shrimp was on the raw side. \n\nThe service is still very good and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice.  They also have the best reverse happy hour which starts at 10 PM and I believe and goes til 1 AM.
4,M'fn delicious !!! Amazing bartenders and servers... Great environment and the food is beyond delicious!!!
1,"Please tell your servers to be more responsive to their customers.  Don't sell so hard -pushy waiter that interrupts conversations. Offer a cocktail once, not 3 times,  and bring water. Don't visit the table 15 times during one meal, it is rude. Be a professional!. Our party was interrupted continuously by the chatty waiter. Not offered a wine list or bread, nor dessert or coffee. Although the cuisine was mostly delicious, he ruined it for everybody. Will not go back."
1,"Pizza was ok.. I ordered Vinnies, which is your choice of 5 toppings.  Italian sausage, black olives, onions, garlic and basil.  It wasn't bad - but it wasn't great either.  \n\nThe server was exceptionally friendly and helpful - but the service was the high point of the experience."
3,"This is a nice little pizza place, one that I can see myself coming back to. I recently ordered the small Brooklyn pizza with some cheesy garlic knots. The crust was cooked nicely, with some tasty pepperoni, sausage and basil. The cheese on the knots didn't really stick well, but it was all pretty good as well."
1,Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left.
1,"Food is good for the most part. The employees could care less if your there however. Stood at the door watching the host and waitress flirt near the bar. Finally gave up and sat ourselves. Still no attention from a server so my wife walked to the counter to order. That finally got someones attention! We got some sodas and ordered our food but to our disappointment multiple people came in, ordered after waiting to be seated and got their food before us. I guess if you seat yourself and put your own order in they no longer consider you a good customer or something because it sure felt like no body cared about our experience. Only way we got a drink refill was to flag down the waitress.  Bad experience service wise but its what we have grown accustomed to at this location. Take my advice and just order delivery."
1,"I think this is the only Big Lots I've been to in PHX -- and I've only been here twice. It's fairly ghetto, and right next to a sketchy Goodwill. \n\nI didn't see it being dirty per se, but I did find it having a bunch of \""lower quality\"" items -- especially in their electronics area, which is to be expected. \n\nThey did have some outdoor patio furniture, that seemed reasonably priced. I never thought of Big Lots for patio furniture..., but still wouldn't buy that here."
1,"I made it to Guiseppe's only after a friend had seen it on the Food Network.  I'd heard of it before, but hadn't ever felt like making the trek out here from Glendale.  On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.\n\n\nYes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.\n\nThere was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.\n\nThe place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.\n\nThe food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.\n\nBut in the end, the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall \""meh\"" dining experience."
1,"I had a hard time finding this restaurant to review it because at first I thought it was called As Seen on Food Network....but I found it so on with the review. My wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner. It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered (a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food) and the fact that it was cold from the drive home. So when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Well enjoy I did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink (don't adjust your screen; this is not a review for Peter Piper Pizza). But hey, I am not a snob; I love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food. But sadly this was not the case; it was not the worst Italian I have ever had, I am old enough to remember Wendy's super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter. But for the price and the hype it was strike two; I had a Caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce; both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end. The service was poor, we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us (just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered). We also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out. I think my wife summed up our service experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can Coke into her plastic cup for her. The bill came and I found myself paying top dollar for mediocre food and poor service; strike three, ball game."
4,Service and food was excellent!! Red sauce is to die  for! Pregnant girl's dream!! Steve was an awesome Server. Order the risotto balls!
1,"First impression: Not great. We had menu shock when we saw the dinner prices. Dinner for 2 here, will run you around $50 or more. For prices in that range with this atmosphere, it's appalling that they serve drinks in plastic party cups, and soda comes in a can.... No refills. Seriously. The food... Meh. I've had better for half the price... Actually a third of the price. Just because they were featured on food network, doesn't mean it's worth going to. In fact... Restaurants PAY THOUSANDS to shows like DD&D just to be featured."
4,"What a wonderful experience! We actually were told about this local gem by a waiter at another restaurant. Then we found out that they had also been featured on one of my favorite shows, Diners and Drive Ins so I figured if it got raves from Guy I couldn't pass up a chance to visit too. From the first friendly hello when you enter the door you are treated as if you are an old friend even if  you're a first time visitor like I was.\n  The food is amazing. Homemade pasta is so yummy. Be advised, portions are very generous-so share or be prepared to take home leftovers, which is not a bad thing. Everything from appetizers to deserts can be shared and you will still leave feeling very satisfied and very happy that you have been to Giuseppe's on 28th."
3,"Went here for an outing with six other friends. I do not recommend this since the place is small and quaint, however, we were very lucky and scored tables pushed together right away.\n\nThe garlic bread was deliciously heavy on the garlic and butter. Despite being drenched, it's texture was surprisingly still crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. (You order by the basket for $4, otherwise, you get regular bread which is meh).\n\nThe baked ziti was perfect. The penne pasta was perfectly cooked. The ricotta cheese was nicely proportionally mixed in with the pasta and sauce. Its a simple dish, yet satisfying.\n\nThe tiramisu was also mouthwateringly delicious. Its consistency was very mousse-like  making it basically melt in your mouth after every bite."
4,"Everything here was amazing!  I can't think of anything that I was unhappy with, which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars.  I made a reservation for my boyfriend as a surprise birthday dinner last week.  I was a little hesitant planning a birthday dinner at a new restaurant.  What if we didn't like the food or the service was poor?  When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a guy who I'm pretty sure is the owner.  After checking out the menu and FINALLY deciding on a dish (everything sounded great), my boyfriend ordered the seafood risotto and I ordered the rigatoni primavera, a vegetarian dish.  Each dish was served with a salad or soup and they also served fresh bread at every table.  While we were waiting for our food we noticed that the crowd there was much older.  I think we brought the median age down by about 30 years!  I also noticed that the guy who seated us was visiting every table, and chatting with everyone.  It seems like most of the people who were eating there were regulars, and knew all the details about this guys family.  Our salads arrived, and although the portion was small the Italian dressing was delish!  Next came our main dishes.  My boyfriend's plate was packed full of seafood including shrimp, scallops, mussels, and clams.  A bit too fishy for me, but he loved it.  My dish was amazing as well, with lots of flavor and tons of vegetables, including mushrooms, zucchini, and cauliflower.  In past reviews I always mention how it can be difficult to find vegetarian dishes with lots of flavor unless you are at a vegetarian restaurant.  That was not the case here at all, this place delivered.  The portions were big, so my boyfriend and I both ended up with some to take home.  We were both disappointed in knowing we had dinner plans the following night, as we were looking forward to eating our leftovers!  This restaurant was a nice change of pace from our usual loud and crowded old town restaurants.  The place was nice and quiet, with some light music playing in the background.  Overall, it was a great experience, and   I will definitely eat here again."
0,"With 32 reviews and 4.5 stars I had high hopes. We were sorely disappointed. \n\nThe Restaurant:  Dated decor, Christmas lights everywhere (in Feb). Poor layout. \nThe Drinks:  bad wine and poorly made vodka cocktail made this a waste of time. \n\nThe Food:  Mediocre would be a compliment. The ziti and tortellini were terribly underseasoned. The salad was lettuce carrots and oil. Even the bread was subpar. \n\nThe Service:  Our server started off well but went downhill fast. No recommendations, MIA for 20 minutes and taking \""the food wasn't too bad\"" as a compliment made this experience unenjoyable. \n\nThe Price:  There's not much worse than over paying for lackluster food.  I can cook better at home. \n\nThe Verdict:  Any other Italian restaurant is a better choice. Pick the next one."
0,"Boo!  This bar does not have anything going for it.  The place is tiny, and the karaoke painful.  On a Saturday night, only one other party was present with my group of 10.  Yet, the two bartenders on duty still found it difficult to make sure everyone's needs were tended to.  The location is very hard to find as well; I wouldn't have made it without additional directions from a friend.   When I finally did arrive after my 45 minute drive at 10:00p.m., I found out that the kitchen was already closed.  Weak.  I will not return.  Oh!  Did I mention that I was charged for the soda I ordered at the bar?  Generally the soda is free of charge at most establishments, when you are with a group of drinkers."
3,"OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok, like weekly. Filiberto's carnitas tacos. That's all I've ever had from here. Always drive thru. God forbid any of my foodie friends from yelp or chowhound see me. Two perfect little corn tortillas, filled with tender and juicy pork with a few crispy edges, cilantro and pico de gallo. Ole. I eat them in my car. With a measure of guilt and shame. But it just it makes it more exhilirating. And tastey. Ahhhh...a weight has been lifted!"
3,"I've been fortunate enough to stay at several Ritz-Carlton hotels around the US... San Francisco, Amelia Island, Atlanta, Buckhead, and Lake Oconee are the ones that stand out.  I've also been to events at many of these locations and more and I've always been blown away by how beautiful these hotels are and how incredible the service has been.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Ritz sets a standard for other hotels, and they are known for luxury!\n\nWhen I recently spent the night at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I was not as blown away... the room was just ok - nothing so special, and I don't have any major complaints but I guess with my past experience and the reputation of the Ritz in general, I expected more.  (Don't hate me, Ritz-Carlton; I'm still a fan, but maybe not so much of the Phoenix location compared to the rest).\n\nI will say that we did get a discounted room rate because I was being honored as one of AZ's Finest and that's where the black-tie gala took place... and it was quite the event as well - we had a blast!  \n\nI took advantage of the fitness room for a quick workout after we checked in, and it was one of the nicer hotel fitness rooms I've seen in awhile.  Unfortunately, the pool was closed for renovation during our stay, so my BF could not swim on site, but luckily they shuttled him over to the Biltmore to swim instead.\n\nSo, overall, it was a pleasant experience - I just can't bring myself to give 5 stars like I would at any of the other Ritz-Carltons I've been to... but stay tuned for my review of the Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch (which is where I'll be heading in December for a wedding) - that one looks like it may be the best one I've seen yet!"
3,"I truly enjoyed the meal i had there.  I went in for lunch and it was delicious, i had the Manila Clams to start, and the Fettuccine w/ Shrimp and Bay Scallops.  The Tilapia was also nicely done also.  Over all the service was great and i had a great time.  really want to try some more dishes.  Until next time!"
4,"This place rocks.  Super friendly.  Not just fake friendly; really.  I am sitting here in the lobby working and one of the hotel staff came up and offered me cookies.   The place is clean; the meals are nice; it feels safe;  nice business center to print and fax documents; good fitness center and cut-rate daily passes to LA Fitness next door; very convenient; good laundry machines.   Even our kitty cat likes it.  Being out of your house because it is flooded and needs repair is no fun, but this places has made life much better."
3,"I live nearby  and have driven past this place many times. Today my wife called me and asked that I bring her lunch. Needless to say, we were not disappointed by these gyros. Savory meat piled high with the right amount of sauce atop a a fresh pita was a great lunch."
4,"I love me some Merc Bar, it's tres chic from it's comfy couches to it's awesome staff.  The drinks are indeed pricey but they pack a punch so it really all evens out in the end. How can you not love a bar that's got a twin in NYC and lets you dance on the tables?!"
3,"I haven't been here in over a year since I lived in the biltmore.\n\nI loved this place.  Great looking women and not as pretentious as scottsdale, pretty low key yet classy. Ran into Amare one night too.\n7$ for a large glass of stolli vanil on the rocks. cant complain about that."
2,"Trendy, dark, crowded.\nWhen I think of Merc Bar, I think \""ehhh\""\n\nIt's not bad, just not great enough for me to remember it or frequent it on a regular basis.  \n\nThe drinks are spendy, but tasty.\nThe sausage and cheese plate is good, but not memorable.\n\nEhh."
3,"I like Merc for the dark, sexy, loungy atmosphere. I think its perfect for small groups to share a cheese platter and a bottle of Champagne. And when the music is hot....its hot! \n\nDisclaimer if you've never been: it's situated across the corridor from Houstons (Camelback)  and I think the sign above the door merely says \""Bar\"" or \""Lounge\"". \n\nEnjoy!"
4,"This place is hidden, and hard to find for someone whose not familiar with the area.  Great people, great martinis and great customers.  My favorite bar in town.  The people who work there have been around for a while.  They know you by your name and they feel comfortable to shake your hand or give you a hag......  Sofia Lauren Martini and some oldies are one of my favorite drinks at Merc.  They have another one in NY which i have been there but i prefer the one in Phx."
2,"This place was actually pretty hard to find as there are not signs outside the building. I would recommend using the valet  as the parking behind the building ends up being a lot more expensive.  \nWhen we got there the place was pretty full, therefore, the service was not the best. Our waitress took about 30 minutes to come around and get out order so our experience was not the best. \nThere was also a DJ spinning all night long, mostly R&B and hip hop, but there were all today's hits. The place has a small dancing floor, but to be honest most of the people were not even dancing. Not a bad atmosphere but not the best bar/lounge either."
1,"I don't know what happened to this place!  They once had great bartenders that knew how to make some amazing cocktails, not to mention they could handle a full bar in stride....I went there last week and this place is just awful now in comparison.  I am sorry Merc, your service was poor and slow, with a kind of haughty, supercilious demeanor.  Not sure I will be back."
2,"CPK. Creative. Pizzas. Kinda.\nWhen I think of the early 90s. I think of CPK. Of course I also think of Joey Lawrence on Blossom. But who doesn't, really? And new Coke. And we all know how that worked out. But CPK was innovative at the time. California cooking was all the rage thanks to Mr. Puck. The BBQ Chicken Pizza won over droves of pizza fans. Quickly, the Thai pizza caught on and CPK became quickly initialized in American culture like KFC, PTA and FYI. This location serves up the fare like all the others. Not much panache but dependable. Much like the Chevrolet Malibu. Could they use a bit of a makeover? Sure. But the Price Is Right set got one and no one's loving that. So why bother."
2,"Much better than the frozen variety.  Sort of better than the quick serve shop in the Fashion Mall in Vegas- from what I remember.  This place was just as I was expecting: way crowded at lunch time, over-priced pizza and drinks, and so-so service.\n\nThe pizza I had with wheat crust that included eggplant, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese was pretty tasty.  I guess if you consider that I had a second meal out of the pizza, the price wasn't too bad."
1,"Not my \""cup of tea\"" -- too Yuppie for me!  Atmosphere way too \""sanitized\"", and servers have little or no personality.  The food is fair but not worth the price IMHO!  What ever happened to pasta or pizza with RED sauce?  Seems they have every color and concoction known to man except red (well maybe one or two)- being of Italian descent I need red!!  I ordered from  the \""Small Bits Menu\"" because I wanted a light lunch - believe me - it definitely was \""Small Bits\"",  good thing they gave out bread because I needed a second helping of that just to let me know that I ate something!  My suggestion is to order from the dinner menu if you want a full meal - of course most folks are much more sophisticated than this old country boy and can figure out what most of the fancy California stuff is on the menu - sorry!"
1,"Rodney the waiter messes up the orders ALL of the time.\n\nEvery food I have tried at CPK has been nothing but yummy, but this waiter really ruins the dining experience. I give the food 5 stars, but I give my experience at this place 2 stars, all because this particular waiter screws up our orders consistently.\n\nOne time, we ask for the bread..the bread never comes out, just our meals. \n\nanother time, I ask for extra sauce on the side of my salad, never came out\n\nanother time, I asked for no peanuts in my salad - it was filled with peanuts\n\nthis last time was the topper -  ordered an appetizer, and it never arrived. I also asked for no tortilla strips in my soup - it comes out loaded with tortilla strips. And when we got our bill at the end of lunch, we told him that our appetizer never came out because we wanted to make sure we didn't get charged for it, and he pulled out the order he had written and confirmed that it wasn't even written down!\n\nit's the same guy EVERY time - I don't know how this guy still works there and why I keep being the unfortunate one always falling into his area, but I am not dining at this location anymore - much too stressful"
0,"Keep trying to unsubscribe from their mailing list, though today they sent me 7 SPAM emails.  \n\nStop it! \n\nThey also have a link to review their spa's on Yelp on the e-mail - though it just goes to the Yelp homepage. \n\nThey obviously don't care much about their customers.  \n\nIt was so long ago I was there I can't remember the service."
1,"Had eyebrows done and esthetician ripped my skin off in two places. I called and spoke to the manager Casey and she was rude and blamed me for it. I explained I have had this done a number of times and never had any issues. She asked that I come back in and I was seen by a different esthetician. I saw the new esthetician who was extremely professional and relieved the pain I was feeling in my eyebrow. She apologized and explained to me how this could have happened. When we finished she thanked me and apologized once again. When I was leaving, we saw the manager Casey and the esthetician explained to her what happened. The manager never apologized or thanked me for my business. This woman should not be managing a spa of this caliber. I don't plan on going back there again."
3,"I have been very happy with the care my dog has received at Squaw Peak, they take good care of my pug. The staff is very kind, I can always get a last minute appointment, and I never have to wait. They treat my dog as if he is their own, as others have said.\n\nA puppy was found at work, and when I brought him in to Squaw Peak, he was diagnosed with distemper, and the best course of action was to put him down. When I asked about the cost, the vet was kind enough to take care of it at no cost. \n\nThey have also been willing to bill me for needed vet care and allow me to make payments when I was having financial difficulties, however, I was not pleased about receiving a collections notice from the office after making a payment that covered the majority of the amount owed. The person in charge of billing told me I could make another payment for the remaining amount ($70) this month, and I just needed to call in and make arrangements. Given my positive experiences, I can only assume this was an oversight."
1,"We chose those restaurant because we wanted a good steak and the Omaha name is synonymous with that. \n\nArrived on a Friday night around 8 pm, the place was pretty empty. The waiter was friendly but didn't have much personality. He was actually more of an order taker, but everyone has their own style.\n\nWe had the bleu cheese chips, which were excellent. Before the meal we had a ceasar salad (which was huge!) and the black bean soup, pretty decent. The soup almost had a sweet flavor to it, which I liked. At this point in the meal I was feeling pretty pumped about our 16 oz bone-in ribeye that was about to come. When it did arrive I was unfortunately, disappointed. We ordered it medium rare and it was a little more on the rare side. Personally, a little under is always better than a little over. So, the temperature of the steak was fine, but it was really lacking in flavor :-(. It seemed like it needed more seasoning and for a ribeye it really just wasn't very juicy. And for a $40 steak, it should have knocked my socks off. However, the green beans we ordered as a side were very good. \n\nI could tell throughout our meal the server seemed a little rushed. He mentioned to us that he was also taking and running all of the room service orders. Having to do all the extra work was probably not his fault, after all everyone's got a job to do. Unfortunately, it caused his service to really lack for us. \n\nAll in all, we had a pleasant time but I do feel like a few things could have been just a bit better...especially for the ticket price we were left with. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back."
1,"Went in to look at a matching wedding band for my Tacori engagement ring.  The man that helped us was nice while we were in the store and was going to reach out to Tacori regarding a few questions we had.  He honestly wasnt overly knowledgeable about the brand, which was fine since he was willing to contact Tacori directly.  We never heard from him so we bought the Tacori wedding ring elsewhere.  I don't know why he didn't call us...I can't imagine him thinking we were not serious given I already have a Tacori engagement ring with a diamond that is well over 2 carats.  Oh well.  Their loss.\n\nOn another note, I've had my ring cleaned in their store and the designer specifically says that their rings are NEVER to be placed in Sonicare.  When I mentioned this to the sales person he had no idea.  So much for authorized retailer."
2,This is a good place to do a lot of laundry in a short amount of time. It is probably five stars during the slowest hours. I wouldn't recommend coming on the weekends.  The laundry carts are hard to get and parking can be limited. They do have change machines that work well.
1,"Probably the worst tasting stuffed cabbage I've ever had.  It was sickeningly sweet (tasted sweeter than my soda!), and there were raisins in the tomato sauce which probably added to the sweetness.  The ground meat on the inside on the other hand, was very bland.  I thought when you had something as a \""special\"", such as the Friday stuffed cabbage, that meant it was supposed to be really good?  The overwhelming sweetness of the sauce made it very hard to eat.\n\nThe only redeeming factor in the meal was when I tried some of the Straw sandwich (pastrami, sauerkraut, swiss), which was decent, nothing spectacular, but a whole lot better than the stuffed cabbage.  At other delis I've been to, you can get a whole lot more meat, and more flavor for about the same price, so I will probably be skipping any future visits to this deli."
3,"Pleasantly surprised...thought this was just another delicatessen, but this place had a really extensive menu offering something for everyone.  I just stopped in for a snack, but would like to go back and eat a full meal."
4,"Not sure how I have missed this place as I live 5 minutes away but stopped in today for the first time for lunch.  The restaurant is very clean and like many others have said it is cafeteria style.  You step up to the counter and they prepare you food to order.  They have a great number of different sandwiches, salads, soups and deserts to choose from.  I ordered the \""New Yorker\"" Piled high with Hot Pastrami topped with homemade Cole slaw and Miracle Mile Dressing $9.79.  Sandwiches come with your choice of sides and a pickle. I cannot remember ever having better Pastrami.  Service was friendly as expected.  I will probably go back tomorrow.  :-)"
4,"When I went in with my daughter we ordered vegetarian sandwiches and they were pretty awful.  I know they have great deli meats and such.  I complained, and they not only sent a gift card, they actually solved the problem!  I love that.  Now they have some decent vegetarian items.   When I just get a gift certificate from some corporate PR flak,  I don't even want it sometimes because they don't even address the issue.    Miracle Mile did though.  Thank you!  You get five stars."
4,"Why does everyone hate chains? They are chains because their food is tasty and their menu works. I'm sorry if it's not owned by vagrant bohemians. I'm one of the masses!\n\nMy friend, who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, works here and she makes fun of me for wanting to eat there. She makes fun of me for thinking it tastes good. \n\nEverything I've ever had there is very good. Avacodo eggrolls make me smile. \n\nHepatitis schmepitiis..."
2,"Chapter 1 - Appetizers, point is; I don't need an encyclopedia of the world's cuisine on one menu.  I'm hungry and tell me what you serve and are your signature dish - that's all I want.  As you can see I'm not a big fan of restaurants with more on their menu than the number of mistresses of Tiger Woods (Ouch! Sorry Tiger you left yourself open for that one!).  Regardless, I always appreciate the service at the Factory.  Food-wise, I'm generally lost after chapter 2 - Side Salad or Soup?  I just close my eyes and choose and sometimes I win and sometimes, well better luck!  The ambience of the Factory is always pleasing - loud and dark almost like a rollercoaster in Space Mountain except I'm not screaming my head off - Enjoy!"
4,"I'll admit, it has been many years since I have had an actual meal here. The only reason I come is for the to die for cheesecake. It used to be that I would typically get the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, which by the way, is sinful. Well, I guess they all are. It has an Oreo crust, chocolate chips throughout and on the top, and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side. Then they introduced the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I'm like, seriously, Cheesecake Factory? It has a moist, red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake. It also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting. I came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token (as my husband puts it, yeah right!). I got the Cookie Dough slice and then I noticed the Red Velvet which I thought was just a limited time. So what was an indecisive girl to do but get both slices. $16 later (yikes!) but I am the happiest girl in the world."
1,My experience tonight fell very short from my normal experiences at Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time coming to this particular location to celebrate Valentine's Day with my boyfriend.  It was a very busy night which was expected and the staff handled the wait time exceptionally. Our waiter was very prompt and extremely tentative. My issue with the restaurant is with the way they handled a food health issue. We ordered the flat bread pizza as an appetizer but as we began to eat it we found plastic melted underneath the cheese. When we brought up the issue we were apologized to and explained that the flat bread comes wrapped in plastic. We still paid for this item on our ticket even though it was clearly a mistake the kitchen made.
1,"Why do people eat here?  It was packed on a Thursday night.  We had to eat in the bar to avoid a 20 minute wait to be seated.  Everything on the menu is SOOO Expensive.  The only reason we stayed and ate is we had a $50 gift card.\n\nWanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty.\n\nWith three cocktails (A mojito for me and 2 gin and tonics for him), the sundae and slice of cheesecake, with tip was $45).  I think that is quite a bit.\n\nThe best part was the free bread, no joke.  Service was pretty horrid as well."
0,"We came out on a Saturday night. We understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait. We checked in with our name, party of two, was told it was going to be about a 30 min wait, got our pager, and waited outside since the lobby/foyer was crowded. There were a few parties waiting outside too. \n\n40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time. \n\nThis kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude. \n\nThey did seat us about a minute after.\n\nOur waiter was awkward too, but he tried. \n\nWe always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert. We live 30 min away, so we like to make night of it when we decide to come out."
2,not impressed. My salad was $17 for lunch!! and also NOT WORTH IT. Very pricey for what you get.
1,"The front desk girl a few different times wasn't friendly at all.  The food is good but portions are small.  If it weren't for the hostess that never smiles I would rate more stars.  Hostess should be welcoming , accommodating and friendly.  For they are the first person you see when you enter.    Great fried zucchini though !!"
0,FYI. Chili's still sucks.
0,"Went to the one near cave creek. I had the bacon chicken fajitas. I GOT FOOD POISONING !! BE CAREFULLLLLL :/ I have always been coming here, but for now I'll be taking a break from here !!"
0,Disappointed. Suzie was very rushed. About 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment. Suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile. This is the worst my nails have looked
4,I decided to try this place when the nail salon that I usually go to was full and I'm so glad I did .Susie the owner greeted me right away she's very professional and hilarious  the salon is very cleanand not super Busy I definitely will come back here next time that I need a pedicure  thank you Susie :)
4,"La baguette was tr\u00e8s bon! pardon my franglish! I have more reason to frequent here now, to improve my francais!\n\nI was glad to know that my \""Bonjour!\"" was elegant enough to the native ears of the French owner.  :)\n\nIt's been a little while since I last heard the authentic tones of a Frenchman/woman, so I was immediately pleased. woohoo!\n\nAlthough I have not tried everything on the menu, just by the look, vibe and first indulgence of their \""sandweeeesh\"" I will critique it now!\n\nI had the Parisian (Paree-zee-ahn) baguette and it DEFINITELY did not disappoint. EPIC PASS.  I was very impressed on the tastiness and freshness of the ingredients.  The bread itself had the desirable softness and texture that I would expect from a genuine baguette (as I had in France).  The saltiness of the ham, the balance of the mayo, the eggs and lettuce was just superb! I truly enjoyed every bite!\n\nI had a side of pasta which tasted kind of fresh and dressed with I thought was bleu cheese (I didn't clarify with them).  For beverage, I had a very good tropical tasting, iced tea.\n\nI thought the decor was friendly, warm and inviting with French artwork while music played in the background.  The owner and his wife basically run the show.  They were very friendly and attentive.  I will strive to come here as often as I can so I can fine tune my French.  I have a feeling I will make it through most of their menu! The smoked breast of duck sounded intriguing! j'adore duck!"
3,"This place is very delightful, its just a pity that the location is so obscure that they will have to move soon if they plan to keep their business alive. As many have said, it is tucked in the middle of many large buildings and since the AMC is under construction, the business has dropped considerably. \n\nAnyways, the review the food, we ordered the highly yelp reviewer recommended chocolate croissant, the ham and cheese quiche and a last minute decision of the almond croissant.\n\nChocolate croissant: The pastry is flaky and has the right amount of chocolate. The chocolate filling itself is not too sweet and would definitely be a fav for dark chocolate lovers. \n\nHam and cheese quiche: it was good, no complaints at all!\n\nAlmond croissant: This was a surprise and we actually preferred it over the chocolate croissant. It was buttery, gooey and flaky with a hint of almond and powdered sugar. Again, not too sweet and finger lickin' good. \n\nLike many have said previously, it is a bit pricey but considering my mouth was happy, I didn't mind. If and when they decide to move, I will be sure to check their website and follow them to their new location.\n\nSide note: if you are planning to come here, be sure to call because they have had to decrease their hours of operation. Also, they had a sign that said they will not be serving dinner in August."
1,"The second I came in to Au Petit Four I was really hoping to have a wonderful breakfast. Located in the old town area, I thought that a small, family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy (Read: untsss unttsss untss music) mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants. I wanted something fresh, homemade, french and delicious.\n\nWe ordered an iced latte, a nutella crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream, a croissant with egg and sausage and a normandy creme (ham, cheese and egg). The food came in before the waters and drinks, and unfortunately, they seemed prepared ahead of time and left to sit.\n\nMy normandy crepe looked (visually) delicious. When I started digging in, I noticed that it was a little cold (aka not prepared fresh) and that the cheese was barely there and already solidified and not gooey. The flavors were ok but the crepe contents were very flat, so they were very stingy on the portions of their ingredients. The crepe was topped with a sunny side-up egg but had no sauce or added flavors to it. I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better. That was about $8. My iced latte was approximately $5 and really tasted like coffee with whole milk - and the coffee was not a great quality. Not an enjoyable meal.\n\nMy friend ordered the nutella crepe but was delivered a crepe stuffed with fresh fruit instead. Apparently, the order is EITHER a fruit crepe or a nutella crepe, not a nutella crepe served with fruit. When they took it back, they returned the same plate with a hint of nutella placed on top (my friend has already cut into the crepe earlier). The whipping cream was not your typical type: it was very dense and heavy, a weird combo between whipped cream and thick evaporated milk.\n\nThe service was decent but we were the only people at the restaurant besides from 2 other ladies who were just having coffee. The place was very empty, which is sad to see considering the 3 breakfast places adjacent to it had a 30-40min waiting line. I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff. With no customers to make them busy, there is no excused for stingy cold food."
0,"Overpriced and dirty.  Had lunch here with my wife and service was ok but salad they served was stale and moldy.  Ordered a raisin croissant, looked and tasted like it was about 4 days old which surprised us they would serve and charge for that.  Probably won't go back since there are better options in the area, scratch, chez vous, ect."
4,"This is MY store. Not yours, or your neighbors, or her mom's, but MINE. \n\nI love shopping at Trader Joe's. They carry plenty of bagged meals for two people that you can just heat up and eat. They aren't full of awful chemicals like at the grocery store, either. The people who work here are very friendly, and I don't get stressed out shopping here like I do at Safeway or Fry's, plus most things are cheaper. They seem to constantly run out of the Thai Chicken Noodle Salad though... not sure why they don't order more. Every time they get it in, people buy 5 or 6 boxes of it."
1,"I've been to this location a few times now, and I guess it's time for me to write a review of this place.  Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.  The reason I frequent this Trader Joe's is because its A) close to my office, B) there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and C) thier staff is always friendly and helpful."
4,"Since the positives outweigh the negatives by a considerable amount, I'll get it out of the way and say that if Trader Joe's had a more extensive meat department it would be a one-stop-shop for me. \n\nThe store brand quality never disappoints, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and prices are very affordable. That you're greeted by their beautiful selection of flowers, herbs, and other types of foliage and later welcomed to try one of their delicious concoctions cooking in the back is just icing on this mindful preparation of grocery and household offerings. \n\nThe store is always clean and while it's usually crowded at the times I visit, I'm rarely bothered. A friendly place like Trader Joe's seems to attract friendly patrons. If my bright blue insulated tote happens to bump into your bright blue insulated tote while I'm deliberating over the vast cheese or nuts selections, we'll probably exchange smiles instead of middle fingers.\n\nThe folks who work here are approachable and extremely helpful. While I don't regularly drink wine, I find it a nice touch that a personable sommelier is available in the event I need a crash course on pairing and someone can recommend a high fiber cereal.\n\nSome of my favorite products:\n\n-Salsa Authentica\n-Cowboy Cavier\n-Vegan trail mix cookies\n-All-in-one facial cleanser\n-Cruciferous crunch\n-Coconut cashews\n-TJ's brand almond milk\n-Spinach and fontina chicken sausage\n-Spicy peanut vinaigrette\n-Roasted red pepper soup"
3,"Stopped in for some emergency supplies. (Emergency as in there was only butter in my fridge and I had one roll of toilet paper.) The employees were lovely as always, colorful, fresh fruit and vegetables greeted me and I scored in the free coffee & food that was available to sample. Trader Joe's never fails to delight and, of course, I purchased more beer and wine that is humanly necessary. Trader Joe's doesn't need a review. Of course a visit here is wonderful. This is a definite favorite of mine!"
0,"Wow.  What a really terrible experience.  We went in here to get shadescreen material for our windows...I called ahead, asked if they had the correct kind and was told by a very nice guy that they did indeed have what I was looking for.  I have been recovering from surgery and I was not able to walk or drive, so I got my dad to help me out by driving me over and going inside to do my \""legwork\"".  Instead of coming out with a bundle of shadescreen material, my dad came back out of the store looking annoyed.  He said they didn't have the material and the guy in the back wanted to know the name of the guy that I spoke with.  Oops.  Sorry I didn't get his name, but if you say you have the material, why has it suddenly disappeared?\n\nSo, since we were sitting in our car in the handicapped spot just in front of the store, I decided to call and ask to speak to the manager.  He answered the phone up at the front cash register, so I could see him from our car.  I asked him what was going on and why this material was not there when I'd spoken to the guy earlier, blah blah blah.  He didn't apologize.  He didn't go check.  Didn't offer to correct the mistake by finding a store that might have it.  Nope...he said *I* must have made a mistake.  When I told him I was currently handicapped and it took a lot of effort to get to his store and that I'd called ahead precisely for that reason, he said he couldn't do anything about that and hung up the phone.  Then to make matters even worse, he POINTED at our car and started LAUGHING with the cashier at the front.  Holy crap...really?  Laugh at the handicapped girl???  Wow...I don't even know what to say about this a$$ except that I will NEVER NEVER NEVER go back here.\n\nThe Ace on 24th st is just down the street and has nicer employees even tho' it is small.  And, Paul's Ace Hardware in Tempe is by far the BEST Ace in the valley...especially if you need screening."
4,Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
2,"I went here with one of my friends for a yelp event back in January and it was amazing. Well I went back to try their $16 lunch plates(as we had a certificate from the yelp event) and was a little less than impressed. Let  me start with saying the service from our waiter Sergio was amazing, he did a great job with everything and was very nice he was also courteous to ask us if we had any time constraints for our meal so that he could acccomodate. Now let me start on the food. I ordered the clam chowder followed by the Mini tenderloin sliders with green beans. The clam chowder was mediocre nothing to write home about, the sirloin sliders were ok. While one of my sliders was cooked to the perfect medium rare as I had asked the other one was closer to medium well and a little charred. The green beans while they did have great flavor they were unfortunately not very hot. John ordered the clam chowder followed by the Wagyu Cheeseburger and truffle Fries. The cheeseburger was overcooked he has asked for a medium and it came out well, the fried egg on top was not cooked nearly enough if it were mine I wouldn't of been able to eat it because it looked way to slimey, the truffle fries were about the only thing that was tasty on his plate. Overall I feel that for the meal it was 5 star pricing for 3 star quality with again the exception of the service. Maybe for dinner they are much better but I probably will not be back to try."
3,I have always had a great meal here.
0,We went to the location on Scottsdale Road last night. My husband went to one in Minneapolis a week ago and raved about how good it was and he wanted to take me to the one here. We were very disappointed in our appetizer and meal. We ordered the scallops entree for our appetizer and they were sandy. Our steaks were just okay and the crab I had on my Filet Oscar was very strong. I am hoping it didn't come out of a can. Our side was creamed spinach but it should have been called garlic spinach because they put a whole bulb of garlic in it. I LOVE spinach and I couldn't eat it. \nI had high hopes of a long over due date night with a delicious meal but we were let down. We won't be giving this restaurant another try; too many mistakes for the price.
3,"Rarely do you find such value at a $$$$ restaurant. Portions are larger than you'd expect even in the small plates for expensive ingredients like filet Mignon, lobster and foie gras. \n\nFood:\nTypical of high scale restaurants you get some freebies. Among the breads the garlic is the best, my co-worker went through five slices! Another freebie are prawns which are imparted with a smoky flavor from the grill, excellent. We got foie gras for our appetizer. It was served with fresh herbs on a graham cracker like crust. Juicy and succulent I can see myself getting foie gras much more often after this one.  The beef wellington i had was cooked perfectly. The dough and duck fat that surrounded it could not have been better. After being so pleased with the app and entree i was underwhelmed by the desert. The dark chocolate souffl\u00e9  came with a sauce that tasted like it had only a hint of dark chocolate. Not worth it for chocolate lovers.\n\nPrice: Although expensive these ingredients are usually twice the price at different restaurants.\n\nAmbiance: The whole hotel has the Frank Lloyd Wright feel which looks amazing although there is nothing special about this place when compared to the rest of the hotel.\n\nBottom Line: If you're staying at the Biltmore Hotel this place is your best bet for satisfaction."
2,"The room was comfortable, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. However for the price the food was just ok. It was our anniversary so we expected some little treat with a candle at the end but what they brought was a plate of pink cotton candy. Holly tooth decay Batman!"
3,"I really can't comment on the \""value\"" because my company picked up the tab, but I can say that the service they gave us was great and the food was good. I had their 16 oz steak and their cheesecake/sweet potato crust (both delicious!). Would be open to come back again."
1,"I had a very similar experience to Allison G. (review written on 9/16/2014). I went in to collect my money at My Sister's Closet at T&C today. I approached the sales gal standing at the register and explained to her what I was there to do. I was told to go to another register in a rather apathetic and dismissive demeanor. Prior to today, approx. 56 days ago, I took in 8 items to sell and 7 of them sold. They were decent labels (BCBG dresses, Coach purse, Elie Tahari skirt, Cache leather skirt, Italian suede blazer, Banana Republic skirt, etc.) and what I received in return in cash was $55. I asked Jenny (sales person) if I could take home my 1 remaining item and they wanted to charge me $5.00 to do so (and that charge will be going up soon according to Jenny and the sign she brusquely pointed to). It was because it was an item they had priced under $25. \""It's in the contract\"" Jenny so gruffly explained. So when taking your clothes for consignment I highly suggest that you stay current on your contract so you know exactly what kind of exchange you will experience from them. Apparently they make changes to your contract whenever they see fit and do not notify you of the changes other than the signs they post in-store. Be cautious and informed before doing business here. I've had my account there for years and I've never felt so dismissed by the sales persons (esp. Jenny), so uninformed, and frankly, ripped off. Bottom-line: Doing business with My Sisters Closet feels bad. I will not be taking my items to be sold there to receive very little in return and to be treated so poorly for being a client of theirs. I'd rather donate my clothes to a good cause, get a tax write-off that I believe is a better financial decision and, more importantly, feel good about doing it."
1,"People seem to really like Sam's, though I am not quite sure why.  I think it is average.  Not great, not bad, just middle of the road food with a Southwestern twist.  Kind of like the Cheesecake Factory.  The food tastes good, but anything meal tastes good if it is loaded with fat."
3,"I had a massage here and LOVED IT!  Caite gave me one of the best massages of my life!  I can't wait to go back and see here again!\n\nThe reason I gave this place 4/5 is for the decor/set up.  They advertise themselves as a spa but the decor makes you feel like you are in a Fantastic Sam's or  Super Cut (things for sale up front, mostly hair stations, very small bathroom, very small rooms for spa services.  \n\nI do plan on returning but only to get massages!"
2,"I have been to Zen 32 so many times I can't count them all.  When I first started eating sushi (my second experience was here) I came to Zen 32 with some friends.  I was still afraid of sushi so I got the teryaki chicken which I must say was quite good.  I ate a bit of sushi on that first visit and I began to get hooked.  \n\nIf I had reviewed Zen 32 after my first visit or two I would have given in a 5.  I like the atmosphere and there is something about the outfits the waitresses are forced to wear that still appeals to me.  The service has always been good and I enjoy that they have seating both indoors and outdoors.\n\nNow for the food.  First, I know this will seem odd, but the water is too lemony for my taste.  It kills me.  I really only drink water, and I like it to be nice and bland and Zen 32 just doesn't do it for me.  As for the sushi, I find that it is a bit hit or miss.  I don't know if I have ever had a better Tootsie Roll.  It is like dessert.  I have tried many others, but I will always go back to Zen 32 for the Tootsie Roll.  Their other rolls are fine, but I am not in love.  Now that I have branched out in the sushi realm, I have found that I can find better.    \n\nSo, in the end, will I go back to Zen 32 again.  Yes.  Is it my first choice? Not quite."
2,I loved the free wi-fi...but the coffee was just ok.  Wish that they would switch to a different brand of soy milk since the Silk soy has a pretty strong flavor profile.
0,"I've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker.  A couple nights ago, we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door.  Being the afternoon of July 4th, the place was empty, save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up.  I ordered a cafe au lait, he an iced coffee of some sort.  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2%, the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar.  Really?  $3.75 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself?  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good.  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes, but even beyond that, the coffee was weak and flavorless, and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk, my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk.  Lame.  Sorry, Hava Java - a repeat customer I will not become.\n\nP.S. - A $0.25 \""service fee\"" is charged to all credit/debit transactions.  Again, lame."
3,Nothing like an Iced Almond milk Extra Dirty Chai to get this day started!!!!  A must try here.....
0,"I went in for the lunch buffet and I will never return.  There are better buffets with greater selections around the same price.  The selection here was limited compared to other chinese buffets I have been to, and what they did have was low quality and low on taste.  The pork was chewy and seemed old, I spit it out after taking a bite.  I don't know how one makes teriyaki chicken taste bad, but they were sure successful here because the sause was greasy and the chicken chewy (probably low quality meat).  The sweet and sour sauce tasted weird, and the hot mustard was not hot and seemed watery.  I only ate some of the chow mein and fried rice, both of which wasn't great either.  \n\nI am not quite sure how this place is in business, with the quality of the food.   I did not try any dinner menu items - so I will withhold judgment, though I will never return to find out for sure."
4,"This is a restaurant I go to because I am hungry, want good, healthy food, pleasant service and I try something new almost every time. May, the nice young lady who always has a smile and great suggestion is a 5 Star server. It's also a good idea to order some fried chicken to go once you finish your meal."
4,This is the best Cajun resturant in Arizona. I've lived in Louisiana before and this is as close as it gets for AZ. I had the crawfish ettouffe and its was awesome and the most authentic I've had since living in Louisiana. My wife had the sampler and she loved it. The atmosphere is great. The live music added to the experience. It was kinda loud though. The waitress was kind of wierd. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some good  cajun food. It is on the pricey side but its worth it.
1,"I've been to Baby Kay's a couple of times and have sampled the catfish, gumbo and red beans and rice. The catfish basket and gumbo were so so while the red beans and rice took the gold. I think Baby Kay's needs some work on their lunch menu. I personally think that $50 for lunch for three people that didn't order any alcohol is a pretty steep price to pay for medicore food. I'm not too excited to make a third trip to Baby Kay's."
2,"Because we are so far removed from the French Quarter my stomach rarely directs me to Cajun. Let's be honest there are few options in this town.  So this becomes the default spot to scratch the gumbo itch.  \nAbove average food, better service, higher than expected prices."
3,My boyfriend and I are both from Louisiana so we were excited to try Baby Kay's. We both had the Bloody Mary which were spicy and full of veggies which we loved. He got the shrimp po-boy and I got the veggie \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Both were quite good. On our second visit he got the sampler which he was less impressed with. Next time we'll stick with the poboy! No vegan options unless you are in the mood for a salad.
1,"I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back."
4,The Doc fixed my eye & the staff rocks... you all get out of Jail for free... Maricopa County Jail only.
2,"Great ambiance for a Asian fusion restaurant, but where are my Asian peeps at???  The hostess-white, our waiter-black, our busboy-Mexican, but on my way to the restroom I finally find them.... The two cooks were Chinese.  The group of us were all from Asian decent and we asked our waiter to recommend some dishes.  When he mentioned kung pao and chop suey, I also busted out laughing.  The food was decent and their idea of brown rice is white rice tossed in soy sauce.  Oh yeah, you had to request chop sticks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm glad I live in the Bay Area.  If you want to try this place, get the Vietnamese beef cubes, the Korean seared steak, the deep fried whole flounder and the fried spinach that tasted like chips."
1,I have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable.  The food is good.  I have eaten here a few times when I was with a group.  I wouldn't ever choose it on my own accord.
3,You usually can't go wrong staying at an Embassy Suites hotel.  The rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy.  You can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too!
3,"I've stayed here twice before, and I think it's a wonderful place for anyone's who's visiting.  Close the mall, movie theatre, Biltmore, and most importantly, Shreiner's Sausages.  Really, though.  It's always clean, roomy, good A/C.  Probably one of the best Embassy Suites I've visited.  And way cheaper than the Biltmore, for sure."
1,"Huge rooms. Soft towels. Comfortable bed with tons of pillows.  \nThree things that make me happy when I'm traveling.  \n\nWhat's wrong with this place, then? First of all, the location is central to nothing aside from the mall which houses several chain restaurants.  Second, the staff could not care less about pretty much anything. While the woman who checked us in was helpful and friendly, that was the end of that. Despite requesting my Hilton status \""amenities\"" (just a package of snacks and water...not much), I never received it.  I was also charged $30 for internet when I shouldn't have paid a thing (got the bill corrected at check out). And housekeeping didn't leave enough towels or replace the water.  \n\nConsidering we paid over $200 a night, the blase attitude of the staff is very disappointing."
0,Check in staff was great the view from out side was ok. Then the room electrical switches that are barely sticking out some you can see wires on. Paint was peeling all over and the shower was falling apart the caulking was all coming off. These rooms are not what I expect for this price. Even the tv which was a older flat screen did not have HD and half the channels failed to work. Breakfast was not great and  they failed to clean up tables so no where to sit and eat. Pool area had several areas trapped off as well as the parking lot had a lot of it closed. Over all very disappointed in this property I would not recommend it. When I checked out I was told your good to go as she ate her breakfast and then walked away not once was I asked how my stay was.
4,"Our family spent Christmas at the Embassy-Biltmore and had a wonderful experience!! \nUpon check in we had reserved 4 rooms and I walked up to the front desk greeted by the friendly staff led by Joe ODonnell. I said my name once and Joe was aware of my reservation and the requests on the reservation. Without even looking down at the reservation!! This was the beginning of a stay that was perfect in all ways. The rooms were clean and the property was very well kept! It is an older property so we did not expect it to be new but we did expect clean and that is what we got! All of the employees that we encountered were fantastic!! The cook to order breakfast was phenomenal with wonderful staff there working for us on Christimas morning! The happy hour reception was enjoyed by some of our family and they commented how much fun they had with the bartender, Adam who was very attentive and again there working over Christmas! \nOne thing I noticed was that Joe was walking around the property and was very helpful at all times of the day and evening. It gave me a sense that someone knew what was going on in the hotel at all times.  I even saw him help an elderly couple to find their room and carried their luggage. \nIf you are looking for a great place to stay with your family (pet friendly) this is the place to go! We will be back next year and even though we live in the area, (Gilbert) we will be back throughout the year! We have a small dog and it was wonderful to be able to take her with us for Christmas. All of the other animal lovers there that had their furry families with them were very courteous and thoughtful! (We met outside when we were walking the dogs for a potty break) \nThe property works well for a family due to the two room set up with a living area and bedroom in the back. The beds were great in all of the rooms. We set up mini Christmas Eve horduerves in one room and enjoyed watching the games and each others company!! Not one person had to take the brunt of all of the company at one household and cooking. We did eat Christmas dinner outside of the hotel but will enjoy the Omaha Steakhouse on the property next year. \nThank you for making our holiday such a success!!"
1,"The ambiance was amazing, the sparkling wine upon entry is a great touch, and the service was decent (although a bit young and inexperienced overall).\n\nSo with all the highlights out of the way, let's get on to my problem with the Wrigley Mansion.  The food was overall good, but not exquisite.  Of the four dishes that we tried, I would have thought we selected from the menu of a $15 per plate neighborhood restaurant, not a $25+ fine dining destination.\n\nThen I ordered the wine, 2004 Rombauer Merlot, a very familiar vintage for me.  It was bad.  Next glass, different bottle, also bad (can't remember what it was, though).  I ended up with a glass of the house wine.  Bad wine is unacceptable for any restaurant, especially when wine can play such an important role in the meal.\n\nDessert was great, but I only know because I stole a bite from Catherine's plate.  I'm just not a desert guy.\n\nOverall, I would say that yes I will go back as soon as they lower prices and downgrade the ambiance to be more casual, or fix the problems.  Until then, I can think of several better values for fine dining, mostly in the very same area where Wrigley Mansion competes for business."
2,"The food was pretty disappointing for the price, and the drinks menu left much to be desired.  The music was ok, and the service was very close to on-point for the size of the party.  The space is tremendous; as many have said, it's one of the very few places like it in Phoenix with real history.  I just wish they would bring the kitchen and bar up to the same level as the location."
1,"I was really excited to visit the Wrigley for my friends birthday. I have been meaning to try this place for years and the Yelp hype has been pretty strong. I was immediately impressed by the staff, we had a very big group and they were attentive and got our drinks and orders in right away. The view of the city was breathtaking and I would come back for happy hour, but just to watch the sunset and a have a cocktail. \n \nThat being said... Geordie's restaurant had horrible food. Honestly, one star at best. I had the Cesar salad which was fishy with stale croutons. I also tried the beet and goat cheese salad and I kept looking around for the goat cheese, I had one small dollop hiding under a bib of lettuce. The carpaccio was the worst I have ever tasted. I think the cut may have been bad and I couldn't take more than two bites. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries; they were the only part of my meal that was anything more than mediocre. For my main I had the tenderloin and it was tough and chewy, the potatoes that came on the side were a joke. \n \nI've been told that Wrigley has the \""pay what you will\"" for lunch. If they applied this to the dinner they served I would left with a much heavier wallet. All in all the over hyped experience left me quite under whelmed. Sure it is a great place to impress your out of town guests with, for the view and history alone. Just take them somewhere else for dinner (like Dick's or Caf\u00e9 Barrio) if you want an impressive meal."
1,"The food was below average relative to the prices. I enjoyed the food, but it was not fine dining quality. Based on the prices (around 150 for two people), I expected something quite memorable, but instead it was quite mediocre. \n\nIf you sit on the patio on a cool fall evening, this would be a nice place to have a few drinks, but I certainly wouldn't go for the food. Of course, the building is beautiful and creates a great environment.\n\nAlso, the service was very sub-par on most accounts. Even the hostess was unfriendly and didn't smile or say more than two words. The manager was friendly and the person who delivered the food was very friendly."
1,"The best thing about this meal was the view.  Because we had a voucher, we (along with many others) were put in a separate room with the tables and chairs they use for their events (weddings, etc).  It was a very limited menu and small portions.  The food was average at best, not super flavorful.  Our waiter was nice and the service was good....maybe a tad too quick.  We were thinking it was like the food was prepared like it was for catering and plates were made it advance.  The atmosphere was nice but I'm pretty sure we are not going back."
0,"Now I had a very bad experience with this groomer. Now the shop owner was sweet at first but in my opinion must have become jaded over her long standing years as pet groomer because when I heard my dog cry out from the back room and asked if it was her lori's answer was \""that falls under the category of oh well that's to bad it has to be done\"" I couldn't believe she said that to me but I kept silent I just knew my dog wasn't one to cry like that anyhow I'm going to make a very long story short and let y'all know that the result of that was my poor baby nails being clipped on one paw way to short so short that they were bleeding however I didn't know until I got home and rinsed her off to make sure she was hair free and the powder she had stopped the bleeding with came off. I'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared. I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either. Sorry for dragging you through the mud Lori but in your own words \""that falls under the category of that to bad it has to be done\"""
2,Great place to sit and drink wine on a Saturday afternoon where you have nothing better to do. Food's average. Lots of people watching which I  love. No indoor seating though so avoid when hot.
4,"I've had every carrier you can think of (except, of course, Cricket).  The customer service at T-Mobile is awesome!  I *had* to have the RAZR two years ago.  Ugh.  It was the worst phone ever.  Wasn't T-Mobile's fault, just Motorola.  Anyway, visited the store twice and had to get replacement phones.  Each time, they exchanged the phone for free.\nEven now when I have troubles, I go in and everyone is friendly and helpful.  \nI'm still with them for another couple years (I keep needing new phones!) and wouldn't change providers for anything right now."
3,"This Saks location has to be my personal favorite for their service style. Everyone is friendly, they great you, they often offer you a water bottle, however they let you wander if you tell them your just looking, and check on you sporadically but never smother. \nAlso they have the best makeup counter service of any store in the valley, period. My favorite is the YSL and Dior shared counter. Those ladies and gentleman are the best at telling you about their lines as well as other alternatives. For example on my last visit they showed me their concealer and ran to the Nars counter to show me one with more coverage. Which is what I was looking for. \nThe only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because shoe sales rack has really dwindled in size over the last year or two. Other than that, this place is fantastic."
1,"I travel frequently, work late, and don't always have time to make reservations before a late meal opportunity. We were greeted In an unwelcoming manner at 9pm at this Morton's. That along with waiting a solid 10 minutes before getting menus just made us feel even more \""rude\"". The stuffy vibe needs to change for us to come back....Morton's is nice and convenient from the Ritz,  but i'd drive the extra few miles to City Hall next time.\nThe food was good although the Seafood platter - oysters, lobster, crab were below average compared to other Mortons. Steak is probably better in the desert."
3,"get the ngocchi and that is all I have to say.... do it before you die.   The stuff melts in your mouth and I have never had it taste so good anywhere else.  The food and service are great at this place and the prices are like a really high end restaurant.  This place has been around since the 70's and it shows...which is my only complaint.  I really wish they would remodel this place and revive it a little bit because the food is really good.  The owner is always around our server has worked there for 33 years if that doesn't tell you something.  The atmosphere in the bar is black and white checkerboard tile with mirrors for walls.  The dining room has been painted but the furniture is a little dated.  I ordered the veal Marsala and it was fantastic, my wife got the salmon and it was even better.  I wish this place was closer to home I would come more often."
2,"I go here when I want to stuff myself silly on the weekend after a night of drinking. I always order the chicken fried steak and it's VERY good. I am a huge fan of chicken fried steak and eat that anywhere I go and this one is in the top 10.\nThe staff is very friendly but they do seem to be understaffed for the most part but they get the job done.\nThe Cinnamon roll is delicious and HUGE. I have to take it home with me for later because I never have room to eat it while I'm there.\nYou'll most always find this place filled with an older crowd but that's fine, it keeps the noise level down."
3,"I've been in the process of moving, and have been Cox-blocked several times. (Was cut off at my old house too soon, having issues getting service at the new place.)\nI don't have a smart phone - so I really need internet access to coordinate the move and stay in touch with the outside world.\n\nDenny's and Starbucks lost my interest very quickly. I needed wifi access, and I am more than happy to be a paying customer to get it. Oh, and I keep a late night schedule.\n\nEnter Jerry's. Not far from the new house, open 24/7, and wifi access as requested.\n\nUntil this past week, I hadn't been into Jerry's in almost 20 years. I am so sorry it fell off my radar - this is a great place for a quick and affordable meal anytime day or night. And - quite the happy surprise - the food is pretty damn tasty!\n\nLate night, visit #1 - I wasn't really hungry, but thought it would be tacky to just nurse an iced tea, so I was going to get a slice of dessert. (Offerings were apple, cherry, Boston Creme and Lemon Meringue pie, Chocolate or Lemon cake.) Then the waitress mentioned something about the awesome cinnamon roll with whipped butter, and that sounded perfect. AND IT WAS!\n\nLate morning - visit #2 - Coffee and a Reuben sandwich with fries. Quite possibly the best diner Reuben a girl could ask for! YUM.\n\nLunch time - visit #3 - I brought a friend today. (Cox was supposed to connect me this morning, she was going to set up my home network. That didn't happen, so the least I could do was buy her lunch.) She had iced tea and a grilled club, I had iced coffee and a hamburger. I was super happy. Her only complaint was all the bacon seemed to be on one side of the sandwich - so she had to open it up to rebalance.\n\nI am happy to have Jerry's nearby - and will most likely be in fairly often  - even when I can access the internet at home. Breakfast 24 hours a day? Yummy desserts? Friendly servers? Reasonable prices? Check, check, check and CHECK!"
1,"Ruby Red Crab Legs ....YUM!    (There is a big $$ though for this Yumminess!....$70).   We started our meal with the N'awlins Shrimp appetizer.   Cajun spices but with \""little itty bitty\"" shrimp.   It was just OK.   We actually ate at the bar.    The bartender, Brian, was very attentive.  Of course he was, we were the only two people in the bar for two hours on a Saturday night.   The bar is good size so that has to be a bad sign for Steamers.  Can you imagine what their rent could be in The Biltmore on 24th St. and Camelback??\n\nWhen I read Brad H.'s review of Steamer's,  I was touched by his story of the \""Lovely lady who is now his wife\""  who he proposed to at Steamer's.   Brad,  do you have a twin brother????  What a nice guy you are!"
2,"Steamers seems to be a Phoenix/Scottsdale staple for good seafood. The food wasn't bad, it wasn't THAT great either, though. The wine list is sufficient and the service adequate. The menu has some good combination dishes and a mix of seafood staples and chef creations. I had the seabass, which was tasty and fresh, but nothing memorable for me. Atmosphere wise, the booths are nice and probably the only place I would want to sit in the place, but I didn't really get that \""contemporary and cosmopolitan\"" vibe at all. The best part about Steamers may, in fact, be its perfect location centered right in Biltmore Fashion Park."
2,"Was here for a KYOT Wine-Down-Wednesday event a couple of years ago.  The bar area was packed.  Stood around waiting for a table to open up- very uncomfortable as the area is pretty small.  \n\nI remember trying the New England clam chowder.  Tasty, but it had too much potatoes and not enough clams.  Had something else, but can't recall which, and the current menu online reflects a few changes.  \n\nI do recall thinking I would like to come back and have lunch or dinner there, so I'm giving it three stars."
0,"I had read good things about this place, so I was excited to try it.  Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience.  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and split pea soup.  The food took forever to arrive.  When it finally got there, my grilled cheese was missing the tomato, and the cheese was not completely melted.  I ate it as-is, since I didn't have the time to wait for a new sandwich.  I subsequently opened the ketchup bottle which somehow exploded shooting ketchup all over the table and my clothes.  Not a great start.  The pea soup was ok, but there were too many croutons in it and not enough peas.  After finishing our lunch, we waited at the table for an incredibly long time and never got our check.  We decided to go stand at the cash register to see if that would help.  The staff completely ignored us for about 5 minutes before someone finally came to the cash register (not a big place, they saw us waiting).  The lady at the cash register did explain that they usually were not that busy, but for us it was too little, too late.  There is no second chance to make a first impression: I'm not going back."
1,"The store is small and uncomfortable, but the products are decent."
3,"The closest touristy, Arizona-esque candy shop to me here in Central Phoenix.\n\nCactus Candy Co is located in a small building room, stocked with: hot sauces, jellies, marmalades, cactus gummies, prickly pear taffy and shirts. Upon entering I was greeted and was given some advice on the popular items people typically purchase. It was helpful, good amount of candies and jellies but definitely limited. Two thumbs up for having a discount with paying with cash + being a student. With the discount it ended up not being too expensive either. \n\nI got a few boxes of prickly pear candies, taffy and jelly for my friends and family back home. Crossing my fingers they'll enjoy the distinct taste of prickly pear from the good ol' Valley of the Sun!"
4,"Absolutely unbelievable dry cleaners! This business understands customer service and exemplifies it with every interaction. Lee is phenominal. Pretty sure this is the type of business that like a dentist, when you move elsewhere you just have to go back... you know what I mean. I'll be 45, unemployed, living in Philly and still flying to PHX to have these guys clean my clothes."
3,Another fine dinner at China Village.  I ordered Ma-Po bean curd for dinner.  I had enough to share with my dinner mate.  The service was excellent as usual.  The hostess was very concerned that my group enjoyed their dinner.
4,"I was in town -- will be moving there soon -- and looking for some good Chinese food. I haven't had any in years. Anyway, I spotted China Village and decided to give it a try, and am so happy I did. Hot tea is brought without having to ask for it (just like they all used to do!), and the food was great. Plus, the people were absolutely delightful! Wonderful service and so friendly. \n\nI can't wait to go back!"
0,"Let me tell you about Frank's Pizza on Indian School. I placed my order today 3/18/2012 online at 3:15 for pick up. When I arrived 40 minutes later I was informed that their system was down so they never got the order. Got my money but not my order. I figured ok, things happen, I reordered in person this time and requested they deliver, and was told I would have to wait another 40 minutes. 60 minutes later I called and was placed on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up, called back and was told the driver had the order. 20 minutes later (i live 5 min away), I go to Frank's pizza and demand my money back. I witnessed the delivery guy return and noted he was not carrying my order. Hmmm. So on top of really poor service I had been lied to as well. While I was waiting there (both times)  i watched a really incompetent staff handling the food with bare hands, the place seems also to be in the midst of remodeling (no longer carrying the ice cream). Poor service. Lied to, incompetent staff, mishandling of the food. I'm calling Mamma Mia's from now on, a little longer wait but worth the wait without the aggravation."
4,Lara was the best.  Incredible customer service.  Thank you for picking up slack for some other PB locations.
4,"My husband and I wound up here after attempting to go to the \""Other\"" cupcake place in Phoenix, only to find it was closed - for a MONTH AND A HALF!\n\nAnyway, Barb's is AMAZING!  Super friendly staff that makes you feel welcome and greets you with a smile...  And although I am typically ALL about red velvet cupcakes, I went for a cosmo - and it was nothing short of delicious.\n\nMy husband had a mini cheesecake with the \""choose your own topping\"" and he said it was awesome too.\n\nI think that for all future cupcake runs we will be headed to Barb's!"
4,"I got the most delicious carrot cake from Barb's the other day for my friends birthday. It was such a hit! The best carrot cake I have ever had. I was not surprised though. Everything I have ever had there was yummy. They have the greatest cheese danishes, red velvet cup cakes and cookies! \n\nThey also took the extra time to write a message on the cake for me before I left."
0,"Is is awful customer service, and the people do not wear gloves.\n\ndo not go there."
0,"This is part of a local chain, this location is the missing-link in the chain.  This location is in an older part of Phoenix not a location for the tourist.  \nI can only compare this place to my high school cafeteria during \""Mexican\"" food day.  The place is as cozy as a cafeteria, the servers must have been trained by the \""lunch ladies\"", the noise from the children is only outdone by the screaming parents and the food is a step below Taco Bell.  If you are looking for Mexican food head back to high school.  In a city full of Mexican restaurants you can find a better place by throwing a dart at the map."
1,"This place is very overrated. Food will cost you 15-20 dollars per person, and you can get much better from traditional Mexican diners at half the price. Service was not good, and the food was not good. I had Fajitas, and Applebee's produces a better product. Will not go back again, and in an area dominated by a lot of quality Mexican cuisine, this is a place to skip"
3,this is the best car wash that I have used in Phoenix.  yelp coupon doesn't hurt either.
0,"Horrible service. I bought a $400 belt for a buddy of mine for his birthday and he went the next day to get a bigger size, never wore it or even really touched it. They told him they couldn't exchange it because it seemed a bit bent like if it was worn.\n\nMoreover, the customer \""service\"" salesperson brought the belt into the back room and came back with an obvious new hole in the belt. She said that we did it, even though they gift wrap the box and we didn't even touch it after buying it and it was brought back the same day!\n\nDespicable store. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Blatant fraudsters won't even give you any service. I will not let this go lightly."
2,"I know I will upset some fellow Yelp friends with this review, but the Ruth Chris on Camelback was a big disappointment for me. I went with a friend who is a huge fan of Ruth Chris, but I was let down with this location. \n\nAtmosphere: This location makes a better Chili's location than Ruth Chris. The setup is very awkward and to have to leave the restaurant to go to the bathroom in the lobby (which by the way looked like my high school restroom) is not very high end. I have seen single $ restaurants with a better atmosphere.\n\nFood: The steak quality was very good, but I have had many more filets elsewhere (Gibson's Chicago) that have given me much more flavor. My filet was served in a pool of butter. I guess I am more of a fan of a well seasoned steak than a steak soaked in butter. The sides are very average and once again there are steak places in PHX that offer a much more exciting sides menu.\n\nService: This is the only thing that was worthy of mentioning. Devin at the bar served us and he was 5 stars plus. Great service! He also gets huge kudos for his Martinis. He knows how to poor them! Devin saved Ruth Chris from getting 2 stars!"
1,"The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar, and the drinks are literally half full. Don't believe me order a 50/50 vesper, it's 50% full. I will not return."
4,"When it comes to food and service, Houstons is as consistent as it gets!! This Hillstone Group restaurant should teach Fox Restaurant Concepts a thing or two about this notion. \n\nAnywho.... I just wanted to let all Houstons soup fans know that they just changed the Sunday soup from Mexico City style to Mushroom Artichoke. =-0 I'm personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite. However, I love mushrooms and artichokes. This soup is two thumbs up! \n\nBon Appetite!"
4,"Loooooooooooove me some Houston's! \n\nThe hubs and I really dig this place, also whenever out of town family comes in, Houston's is always our first stop on the laundry list of places to hit up. \n\nWe always start off with the artichoke dip. Freaken HEAVEN! \n\nThe hubs usually gets the Hawaiian rib eye \n\n\nMy usual tends to be the Grilled Chicken Salad, they put this amazing dressing on it that is phenomenal! Also, I generally order my salad with a side of fries, because 1. they are the most amazing fries I have ever had in my life and 2. I am a fat kid and fat kids love french fries. End of story. \n\nOne things that i think Houston's could improve on is their dessert selection, its kinda weak. Delicious, but weak. I love dessert and Houston's dessert list does not fulfill my fatty needs. But that's ok, I will live. \n\nThe wait staff is always on point! They are always knowledgeable of what the daily specials are and super friendly. \n\nAlso they now offer complimentary valet parking, SCORE!"
1,"We came here today for lunch for my brother James' Bday.\n\nThe lighting is very dim inside which I liked. The decor is modern cowboy, not my style but the chairs we sat in were comfy.\n\nThere were 6 of us at the table & we all ordered the iced tea, expect my mom who always orders a sprite. We all agreed their iced tea was delicious. For our entrees: 3 ordered the Famous French Dip Au Jus, 2 ordered the Fresh Fish Sandwich & I ordered the Club Sandwich. All came with a side of \""shoestring\"" cut fries. The French Dip was overall liked except one said his was a bit dry. The Fish Sandwich was the favorite among the entrees. My Club Sandwich was mediocre at best, nothing special. I'm not sure what the others thought (well besides my mom) but I loved the fries. I ate all of mine!\n\nOverall this place is nice but the food is way over-priced. I think I would have enjoyed my meal more if I had ordered a steak or even a burger but I don't think I will be coming back to find out."
4,"Yeah, it's a chain and I'm not normally a fan of chains, but Houston's always hits the spot and I've never had a bad meal there. I think Houston's is the most consistent restaurant that I've ever been to and I've been dining at various locations of Houston's since I was a kid. Since I've lived in PHX, the Biltmore location has been my home base and I eat there several times a month. Most of the time, we come in for a late dinner and sit at the bar and let Tom and Al take care of us. These two are among the best bartenders in the Valley and will remember your drink of choice and other preferences after just a few visits."
1,"As I begin to write my review I realize the server I am about to disparage is gossiping with the hostess behind me discussing her discontent with her most recent tip. This is NO Houston's! What happened to ensuring a well manicured table, timely service, and a full glass of wine. Boo."
1,"DISAPPOINTMENT NAMED SALAD.  I've been going to Houston's for 23 years (I started young) and I've been getting the same dish EVERY single time.  Why?  Because it's great EVERY single time.  Never have to worry.  Except this time.\n\nI usually split the salad with someone along with the artichoke dip.  Dip = great.  Salad = Worst.  When did we change it up and add corn?   And the portion was the size of a side salad.  Side salad?  Really?  Are we that pretentious Hillstone?  And never mind about mentioning the difference of proportion to your waiter.  It doesn't go anywhere.  Which was another first.  \n\nAll in all, a Debbie Downer of a meal at the sorta new Houstons."
1,"C'mon man! Really! Your killing me! \nHouston's is such a great food and service oriented establishment that I was excited to take my wife there for her birthday. We were seated right away and the waiter was quick to ask for the drink order. We ordered wine by the glass. I like the service as far as they give, they change out your settings and take away the dishes in an anonymous way. We started with the artichoke, which was a special that night. Really good of course like Bandaras. The sauce was different, but we really enjoyed it. \n\nThe Mrs ordered the Hawaiian ribeye with a weird lemon flavored caesar salad. I had the special NY strip steak Medium rare. We got our wine OK and they stopped by a few times to check on us. We got our entrees and everything looked great. The steaks were good size. The Hawaiian Ribeye was thinner than most ribeye cuts and had a Hawaiian sauce. Mehhhh very so so! The Strip came full of taste but a little tough. It came with fries which were awesome! I wish I had some bread or somethin... After the food came, it was like we were on an island. No one came until we were almost done. The Mrs. needed a refill and they took the glass away, but never asked if we would like another round. Bummer... C.mon - I drop over a Cnote and I cannot get another wine! Someone?... It was like they were just tryin to get us outta there. Boooo!\n\nThe vibe was awesome! The interior is great! Next time, I want to go sit at the bar with all the cougars and people wandering in from the patio looking for the front desk - that makes for good people watching. \n\nWe skipped desert there and went to Culvers for frozen custard!"
4,LOVE Hillstone it never dissapoints.  We ended up at Hillstone last night after being badly mistreated at another restaurant.  (an hour and a half wait that never got us a table)  We arrive at HILLSTONE  hungry & frustrated we explained to the host what happened..... He told us another 20 min. wait we went to the bar and before we had our drinks we had a table! Not to mention a complimentary appetizer and a really lovely waitress.  We were so grateful to be treated so well and the food was outstanding!  Hillstone saved our girls night out and cemented our love of the restaurant!
3,"My boyfriend took me to Hillstone on Saturday night for dinner to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. \n\n1-The interior is stunning. A gorgeous patio with big open windows, a wrap around bar that is decorated with expensive wines, whiskeys, etc... and fresh fruit, the lighting is dim (for us romantic folks), and the overall architecture is modern.\n\n2-Hillstone has exceptional service. From the second we walked in the door we experienced nothing but real people trying to help us enjoy a relaxing evening with dangerously delicious food and beverage. If you are a wine snob, this place is for you. I LOVE myself a killer glass of wine but seeing as how my boyfriend already spoiled us with two new bottles, (which we've yet to enjoy together) we decided to go with cocktails. Our bartender was fabulous and friendly BUT he didn't know what a Moscow Mule was when I ordered it and my boyfriends Manhattan tasted more like watered down whiskey with muddled orange. With no hopes for a Moscow Mule I decided to order their Margarita on the rocks since I could see at least 4 other people at the bar with one. Can't go wrong right? It was ok. A little too much sweet and sour for my pallet. I was a little annoyed when I asked for a drink suggestion from the bartender he automatically started with \""We have Cosmopolitans, Lemon drops....\"" as soon as he said \""Lemon Drop\"" I felt my face go blank and in my head I said \""really man? I know I'm a girl but really?\"" I almost stopped him dead in his tracks to order a glass of whiskey. Straight up. He was just being a great and informative bartender so I of course understood. Just thought that was fairly entertaining. I'm sure they have both those drinks ordered a lot! \n\n3- The food is stupid amounts of tasty and the portions are more than anyone would really ever need. Which is good right? Leftovers! We ordered the Cheese Bread, Grilled Artichoke, and The Vegetarian Burger to share. So basically we ordered pizza, one vegetable, and a hamburger and fries. I felt so heavy after ha! But boy or boy, my taste buds were singing and dancing their little hearts out. \n\nYou get 3 large pieces of half an artichoke, which was more than enough for us. We ended up taking one of the artichoke pieces home. you get 6 fairly large sized pieces of soft, warm ciabata bread covered in two cheeses with olive oil and herbs... and the Vegetarian Burger is on a classic hamburger bun with tomatos, shredded lettuce, pickles, and the burger itself has some sort of orange chutney or glaze(?) on it. SO GOOD. This veggie burger is pretty well known and popular from what I hear! Even steak lovers have got to try it.\n\nThis place has a higher price point and for good reason. Great atmosphere, amazing service, and food that makes your heart happy. You'll be happy to pay for the experience."
4,"Literally \""As good as it gets\""!!  Everything was top notch!  \n\nGreat beer selection; I had a French Kronenbourg, which I can't recall seeing in the US recently.  We split the spinach dip (on a recommendation from my other half's friend) -- amazing. I had the \""Nice Little House Salad\"" (which, by the way, is not named after the French city of Nice, rather the English adjective, which proved true) -- extremely fresh, tasty and very generous with the goat and heirloom beets.  Enjoyed THE BEST rib eye I've ever consumed!  Flawlessly prepared and 1000% tasty!  I got a loaded baked potato for my side and I also ate my partner's cole slaw, which was creamy and horeradishy and supremely delicious!  \n\nThe ambiance; amazing.   The service; flawless.  The food; divine!  It's a tad pricey for a weekly dinner stop, but worth every single penny of it!"
3,"Very loud and boisterous and bustling, and thankfully we had a reservation, but spent a great evening here!  The service was fantastic, the food and drinks came out in a timely manner, and there doesn't really seem to be a bad seat in the house.  I went simple and had the cheeseburger and I'm still dreaming about the next time I can go back and have another, it was fantastic.  And then I doubled down and had the brownie and thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  And the wine list was pretty big with some interesting options.  I would go back in a second, just really decent American cuisine well-prepared and served with style."
4,My absolutely FAVORITE place EVER!! Seriously I've been going to Houston's concept restaurants since I was a teenager and this along with all the others never disappoints. The Hawaiian Ribeye is melt in your mouth delicious and I dream about it... seriously! Service is always amazing (especially Tom at the bar) and I am full and happy every single time I leave! If it was just a tad bit less expensive I would be there weekly but unfortunately it is a once every couple months type of place for me. That's ok though it gives me time to miss it!
0,"Hillstone: you are overrated. You think you are better than you are. Every time I go, I am disappointed and my friends say we are never coming back. \nWe sure miss Houston's in the Biltmore. You tried, but it's not the same. \nThere are so many great places in Phoenix. Hillstone is good. Not great."
2,"We came during a weekday lunch, so they were quite busy. We got seated within a few minutes, no biggie. We got approached by 3 different servers before our actual server came over, which was a little confusing.  \n\nWe ordered a California Roll to share, I got the Prime Rib dip and my mom got a chicken sandwich. The roll was OK, I've had better. The dip was pretty tasty and the fries that came with it were well seasoned and crispy- just how I like 'em.\n\nThe service here was exceptional. The food, considering the price, just didn't really do it for me. For a $50+ lunch, I wish it was a little more memorable. \n\nWhat I did dig tho, were the giant fish outside who practically jump out of the water when you sit by their little \""pond\"" thing. Besides the service, they were my favorite thing there."
3,"I had not planned on being a Mac owner.  My family - oh so very sick of me constantly complaining of Vista -  on first an HP, then a Dell, packed me off to the Apple store a month ago and well, now I have a MacBook.  The sales associate helping me pick out the perfect Mac was good enough, even with two perfectly good (except for the Vista) PCs at home, to convince me I needed this computer.\n\nDo I love it? Not yet.  I like it, like it a lot.  I'm especially loving not having Vista issues that I had been having.  \n\nI'm enjoying taking the one on one classes  to teach me how to use my Mac.  Each time I take a class - I've had 4 now, I have a different teacher and each one bringing a different spin to my classes.  They are nice, friendly, patient, highly knowledgeable.  They are teaching me so many cool features and applications that I can do on my Mac.  My fave so far is the translator.  I do some business in Mexico - my Spanish is limited - so in just one short month the translator has just been a god send.\n\nThe store here at the Biltmore is consistently packed with people, visiting the genius bar, taking group classes or the one on one class and making expensive purchases. I am amazed in this economy just how very busy the store is.  \n\nI'm not totally convinced a Mac is the only way to go (almost though) but this store has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced."
4,"A visit to this Apple Store will help you. Quickly, efficiently and in a pleasant manner. Like other Apple retail stores the design is pleasant. The employees here are what really make the visit welcoming.\n\nI'm a repeat customer. \nI don't really know why I try to shop anywhere else for tech stuff. Other than being lazy and marginally closer to other stores.\n\nToday, for example I was in pursuit of a thing-a-ma-gig to hold my iPhone. Someone had given me a product name. And of course I had instantly forgotten it and neglected to jot the intel down in my iPhone. \n\n(I used a pen. ON PAPER.)\n\nWhile visited a mega-store I explained my product needs: Something to hold my smartphone while I took photos. I needed the function of a tripod without the bulk. The portability to carry something small and for this item to be pliable. (For it to wrap around fence posts and trees. Taking selfies is darn hard. You have no idea.)\n\nLost and confused with a failed interaction at that nameless giant store I rang this Apple. One voice input into their system and I was speaking to a rep. ONE. Same story shared there. I thought I had a product name. They found two options for me - in stock - started to explain the difference when I said, \""Hang on. I'm coming!\""\n\nZipped over. Walked in and was immediately grabbed by a friendly employee. \""Yes, thank you. I'm looking at these items. I already made a choice. But.....I have a random other need.\""\n\nThe dude - and I feel awful writing this review - I never have time to grab names here - found another dude. BAM. Super dude explained some available options.\n\nWhere will I be coming to spend more time? (And likely my money?)\n\nThis Apple store.\n\nCustomer service matters. They've got it down."
3,"An older course with large trees, this is a fun track to play.  The layout is pretty flat, you won't have to worry about driving over large ravines or having a long enough drive to clear problem areas.  The course is well kept and the facility is nice.  The outdoor patio is an excellent place to grab a drink and some food before/after your round.  The guest locker room and bathroom is pretty nice and more spacious than I expected.\n\nThe golf course winds through old houses in Arcadia.  You'll see some nice, new homes and some that haven't been remodeled in many years.  Either way, I wouldn't mind owning one. As is the case with most country clubs, it's a laid back atmosphere with plenty of time between foursomes to enjoy your round.\n\nThe greens are maintained well, but are not too fast.  For an older course, there are plenty of fairway bunkers, but not too many water hazards....just enough to keep you on your toes.  Overall, it's a fun course.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizona-country-club-phoenix?select=R5zU7lZQf5ZdCbNqPW3eXA#xVvgEM-Q2OHt_WZHrFj90Q\n\nReturn Factor - 80%"
3,"The people working at this store are awesome- they remembered me the both times I went in.  I will drive to this Autozone over the others because they are so friendly.  There was a line both times, but with the summer heat in AZ, a lot of people needed new batteries.  Bottom line- great Autozone!"
4,"Outstanding memories of this place...Valentines Day 1999...Absolutely first class service, highly polished cooking, but very conscious of its Southwestern surroundings, this place still stacks up against the best. If you can deal with amusing and effete clientele (bombed-out Barry Goldwater Republicans) then Vincent's well worth the expense."
2,"My Husband and I went to Vincent's last night for restaurant week.  We picked this restaurant because we had never been there and the menu for restaurant week appealed to us.  Overall, I have to say the food was good.  We loved the bread basket at the beginning of the meal and my brie and fig appetizer was great.  The worst part of our experience at Vincent's was the overall service, especially from the hostess, who was clearly overwhelmed with the crowd (I assume from restaurant week).  She had a very poor attitude, which was noticeable by everyone who was sat around us.  In addition to that, they have a \""team\"" service philosophy, so it took awhile to get served and wasn't as pleasant as it could be.  All in all, the food was good, but not worth the price we paid."
2,"We tried Vincent's for Restaurant Week. When you walk in to Vincents there is a bar lobby, since my date hadn't arrived yet, I ordered a yummy lemony gin martini. \nD arrived after about 2 minutes and we were seated at our table. \nWhen our waiter brought our Restaurant Week menu's I already knew what I was ordering since I'd checked out the menu online. I had black bean soup with goat cheese as my first course, Lobster with House Made Basil Pasta as my second course and coconut cream pie with rum raisin ice cream for dessert. My waiter suggested a chardonnay to pair with the lobster so I did that. D ordered shrimp chimichanga for the first course, New York Strip for second course and Chocolate Profiteroles for the third course. The food was delicious. I liked it because I felt since the portions were small I wasn't ruining my weight loss efforts.\n\n it seriously was only about 3 bites in that entire lobster tail and maybe 3 bites in the vegetables and you know what? I was fine with that.\n\n\nI felt the service was impeccable. There was about 3 servers checking us but they never seemed intrusive, they were very intuitive about when we needed something.\n\nMy dessert was delicious and I had it with some yummy coffee.\n\nI didn't think this place was as horrible as the reviews are saying. Maybe my expectations were not very high to begin with."
4,"This is a great spot for a date, and the price is right!  Unique dishes and atmosphere.  Great specials and free desert.  I also can't say enough about the service.  Our server gave great recommendations and brought out 3 different deserts at the end of the meal.  To be honest, I had to think twice about posting a review of this place for fear that it's going to become too popular.  But I would give them 6 stars if I could."
3,"Pro:  value, charm, quality, independent\n\nCon:  haven't found one yet....\n\nSleeper alert.  Great breakfast, well-priced served with a smile. Ditto for dinner. Simple, relatively healthy comfort food.   Good Euro feel to it but not overkill.  Nice change of pace from the generic chains.  \nWell worth a try for a quiet couples dinner or breakfast with the kids--they can draw, play hangman etc on the butcher paper table top.  Comp. rolls to start and dessert to finish with breakfast.  Nice touch."
4,"Vincent's market bistro is my usual weekday go to. Always pleased with there salads, soups, apps, mains and desserts! Scotty and the staff are the best. You know a place is good when there clientele have been going there for years and years."
3,"Vincent's was my third restaurant week stop for Spring 2014, and is a five star but my restaurant week visit was a bit of a bummer.\n\nTheir food is fantastic. Their service is fantastic. It is an expensive restaurant, with the entrees in the mid thirties each, but worth every penny. I hate spending a lot of money and leaving a place underwhelmed, but I'll happily spend it at a place like this!\n\nOn the down side, this is the only restaurant this week, so far, that when I told them I wouldn't be eating dessert, they didn't sub out something else. I forgive them a bit considering of all the places, they are taking the biggest hit in terms of average revenue per table during restaurant week, but let me compare this to two years ago...\n\nTwo years ago a fourth guest spontaneously joined my table of three. Then she said she wasn't eating, she just wanted to hang out... I was a bit embarrassed by this, but said nothing. Then she started to eat off of everyone's plates! During restaurant week, that's completely unacceptable, and they could have been quite justified in charging us a plate sharing fee (which this year is $20).\n\nInstead, Vincent's showed their incredible finesse and taste. They brought her an empty plate to make her food stealing easier! Then, at dessert time, they didn't ask what we wanted, they just bought one of each of the four available desserts! They said, \""well there were four of you, so we just thought you would like one of each.\"" Even though she didn't pay a dime. This was a deeply classy way to say we see what you are doing but will not stoop to your level...\n\nI left a large tip (about 33%), and have told countless people about how Vincent's is the number one date place on my list for great food and service above and beyond any I've ever seen.\n\nSo this year (my sixth time going, three during restaurant week, three regular visits), it was really disappointing that they didn't even try to be creative with me. And no, it was not busy when we were there. I almost feel like the waitress didn't even ask or something and made the call herself.  I bet a manager would have come to explain if they had made that call. The difference between two years ago was a real disappointment.  But what I did eat was of course fantastic. The lobster roll was perfect on a slightly sweet roll, the ravioli was delicious and delicate. Just what I expected.\n\nSo I am only rating them four stars for this review for their lack of empathy and creativity, and for being less amazing than they used to be. But it really is my favorite date place so maybe next year, I'll give them the star back."
2,"I have to respectfully disagree with e.r., as this IS a coffee shop. \nWe went in and ordered \""breakfast\"" which is scrambled eggs with various \""toppings/mixes\"" and sides of bacon. In addition, we each ordered a latte (which was good). \nI started to worry when the gal went to the \""kitchen\"" and I heard the microwave oven opening and closing. I thought, certainly, that the bacon was getting zapped. No, it was \""breakfast\""  which is \""prepared\"" in a microwave....ick!!!!!!!\nNote: I use my microwave at home for one thing, and one thing only: to zap my morning coffee.\nDon't get me wrong--the latte's are good, and this is a good coffee house. \nA restaurant, on the other hand, prepares food in an oven/grill/stove. This is no restaurant!\nGo for the coffee, and get your breakfast somewhere with an operating kitchen...just my two cents worth..."
2,"I was recommended to Dr. Bauer by a friend.  The first time I called to get in, I was seen by Dr. Davey because I couldn't get in with Dr. Bauer until the following week.  He told me I had pink eye and gave me antibiotic drops that made my eye feel worse.  As soon as I stopped taking them, my eye felt better.  It must have just been allergies, so kind of a waste.\n\nI recently made an appointment with Dr. Bauer, and this time they were able to get me in within a couple of days!  I didn't have to wait too long, but I thought it was strange when she came in and said 'it's been a long time since I've seen you!'.  I was like, 'uh, I've never seen you.'  Nonetheless, she seemed pretty nice and concerned about my symptoms.  I was having some weird symptoms, which were difficult to diagnose, so she told me that I needed to get ultrasounds and also they'd like to do some blood work.  She told me to go to the waiting area and someone would come get me.  When the gal came to get me, I was trying to chat with her but she seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me and pretty much ignored me.  I didn't like that, considering she was sticking a needle in me (and who likes that??).  After that, she told me I could go, and was left standing there confused.  I thought I needed to get an ultrasound?  Was there paperwork I needed?  Would they tell me where to call?  I waited another 5 minutes to find someone at the front desk and was finally given a paper to bring with me, along with the info for the ultrasound.  I thought that it was strange that no one cared to tell me what I needed to do.  A few days after my ultrasounds, I received a call from the office saying that they received the ultrasounds as well as the results of my blood work.  The blood work all came back fine and there was nothing wrong there, but she wanted me to come back in to discuss the results of my ultrasounds.  Uhhhh... I called right away, totally freaked out about what the results were!  I had to wait two days to get in to see her, and I had nightmares.  It was not fun.  I go to my appointment, and I have to wait 45 minutes before she ever comes in to see me (and I had gone in the middle of my work day!), and what she wanted to 'discuss' with me was................................................ nothing.  The ultrasounds were all  normal and everything looked fine and dandy.  What?!  Why did I have to come in for that???  So I can pay another office visit fee?  I was really disappointed, and really late getting back to the office.  She recommended I go see another doctor and let her know how it goes.  I feel confused and not 100% sure if I'd go back to this doctor :("
1,"I go here 5 days a week for an hour somewhere between the hours of 5am-7am. \n\nIts dirty. The cardio equipment is usually broken or about to be broken. Bikes missing pedals. Treadmills with torn pads or that literally stop moving at speed randomly in workout. \n\nMorning staff cares none about faulty equipment.\n\nEverytime it rains, the floor floods and no one cares or fixes it. The next year its still flooding. Didn't you notice you had to shut down half the weight area floor because of the last drizzle?!?\n\nThe only reason I keep coming back is because its open when I need it to be."
1,"This location started out as The Q, has been around for a couple of decades and unfortunately is showing its age. \n\nI considered giving just one star, but it does seem like they've finally started to update this place by doing stuff like removing the unnecessary upstairs desk and replacing all of the old TVs with modern flat screens.\n\nHowever, they still need to go a lot further. I wish they would just close down for a week, completely clean, and repaint the entire place with a new color scheme that doesn't give me flashbacks to the 90s. They also need to fix the tile in the sauna and improve the lighting throughout so it doesn't seem so dingy.\n\nEither that or just tear the place down and build a whole new gym.\n\nHonestly, if it wasn't for Mickey's Thursday night yoga class I'm not sure I'd make the effort to come to this location."
2,"This is my first time to this 24..I just moved here from Cali, and I am use to half of the equipment being broken. So far so good. It is clean compared to what I am use to, and doesn't have a strange odor. It definitely does the job for what I need. Though its a little far for my taste, it will now be my home gym."
2,"As an 8-year vet here its obviously a good enough spot to stay a member, but unfortunately the facility ins constantly deteriorating at a faster rate than its being fixed.  With the constant new members, you would think the sign-up fees could help pay for some remodeling!"
0,"I've been a loyal Home Depot customer for years, and this is by far the worst one I've been to in the country. I just bought a home in the area and have been to this particular location dozens of times over the last 10 months. The staff is in not knowledgable, helpful, or responsive. It's extremely disappointing, to say the least."
0,The new owners of Ice House Tavern are no longer hosting live bands. This is such a disappointment to the local music scene!
3,This place is a vegetarian mecca and a lot of the soy meat is gluten free which is a huge perk for people like me. The atmosphere could use some work but the food is good and it is priced well. They have fresh juices and a very healthy vibe. The service is always good and it is never super packed. If you have veggie friends that haven't discovered this place it is a gem.
2,"I'm in turmoil on who I should rate this place. The decor and atmosphere is two stars. It smelled disgusting when we walked in, like sulfur or rotten eggs. Then the decor is like 1980's, with the white chairs. Oy - then there's the service. I'm gluten-free, and I had some trouble getting that across. She said that all of the soy protein has wheat in it, so she recommended the tofu dishes. I ended up getting the tofu dish with rice noodles and vegetables. I have no idea if there was wheat in the sauce, but at that point in the meal, I really didn't care. I just wanted to order and get the experience over with. \n\nThe food came out pretty quickly though. My friend got the spicy cha cha (that looks like shrimp but is actually yam) and it was SUPER spicy and I think it tasted like Long John Silver's fried shrimp basket. BUT she really liked it. My dish was pretty okay, although a little bland. The veggies weren't really great either, but for a vegan dish that's less than $10, I guess it was okay.\n\nI had planned on getting dessert, but we were given the check even before she asked if we wanted dessert. After I made some statement about it she asked if we wanted any, and told us they only had two out of the four desserts on the menu anyways. We went without it.\n\nAnd yes, they do have the TV running strange vegan propaganda. Very strange, and I don't really want to look at baby pigs while I dine, but it could have been weirder. I guess. \n\nSO - for the price, I guess it is decent vegan cuisine. I guess I wouldn't really know seeing as how I LOVE MEAT, but hey, I'm up for trying everything once. I think if the atmosphere and service was better I would have actually liked the dining experience and the food more. If it was better inside, I'd be tempted to go to this place again. Eventually, I'd like to try the dessert. If they offer it to me."
3,I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!
3,"Here's the honest truth on this place: Good food, nice service, somewhat odd decor. \n\nI typically order for pick-up, so I haven't had too much experience eating in this restaurant. On the few occasions that I have been there I have found the servers to be polite and obliging, the food to be hot & tasty, and the restaurant to be clean. Yes, the restaurant does have a religious affiliation that it makes very clear - TV is playing a video on loop, posters of the \""Supreme Master\"" - but, I honestly didn't find it to be as \""creepy\"" or intense as other posters have claimed. I think of it like a family owned Italian or Mexican joint - sometimes there are cultural or religious icons there, too. \n\nAnywho - back to the food. If you are vegan or vegetarian you MUST try this place at least once. After living in NY for a while I mourned Phoenix's lack of vegetarian/vegan food, but then I found Loving Hut. While I can't vouch for everything on the menu - I have tried quite a bit and I swear - it gets better every time I eat it! I am a huge fan of the Sage Lemongrass, Mongolian Delight, and Sweet & Sour Divine. YUM.\n\nOne word of warning - If you are familiar with other Loving Huts: The menu is completely different. I have been to three of these restaurants now and have seen the menu range from Asian inspired to a more Mexican Vibe. This particular restaurant rocks an Asian/American feel. Additionally, some of the names of the dishes are different from venue to venue, so be aware when ordering."
4,"DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE SCARE YOU AWAY! This place is GREAT! It took a few mins to get seated/acknowledged, but I was in no rush. I got vegan Pho and it was the best I've ever had. If you want to leave off on a lightly sweet note, \""Peaceful Pink\"" is what I recommend. (cranberry juice + soymilk topped with rose buds, SO GOOD!)"
2,"Okay, so you don't come here for amazing pizza.\n\nAnd if you're over 12, you don't come here for the games and prizes. \n\nBut when you're feeling pizza, that's not a Hot-and-Ready or one that'll cost you almost $25, you come here. \n\nI admit, I have fond memories of coming to Peter Piper as a kid. I loved it! Over the years, I've been here a handful of times and it's always just as I remembered.\n\nLoud. Full of screaming kids. Tired parents who brought their kids here to shut them up.\n\nSome people say their pizza crust taste like cardboard. But I disagree. My wife, mom and sis came here the other day just because we were in the mood for some cheap food but something we haven't had in awhile. \n\nWe come here and order our food. It was graduation night or something because I saw a lot of kids dressed in what looked like prom dresses with balloons at their table that said \""Congrats\""! Probabaly 8th graders. \n\nAnyway, those large parties were the reason our two pizzas took almost 40 minutes to be made. \n\nWe got them. They tasted just as you would expect them to. Definitely not amazing. But not bad either.\n\nIt tasted like, well, it tasted like...childhood."
2,"YAY! They have SPAM!!!!!\n\nI was going to go for Meat Plate #4 but when I saw the Grilled Spam with Eggs, I was in love. I don't care what you Spam-haters have to say. I'm Asian through and through and will stick to my Spam. Mmmm.. sooo salty and meat-like. \n\nIt was just what I expected, Spam, fried eggs and rice with some macaroni salad. It was good. Reminded me of the days when my parents didn't cook and we would fry up some Spam to eat with white rice and soy sauce. \n\nMy friends were kinda 'eh' about their dishes. It also took a long time for the food to come out for them too.\n\nOne cool thing about this place was that the Phoenix Fire Department eats here.... so hot! Too bad I was busy stuffing my face with Spam and eggs. That was probably not hot."
1,"As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food, you shouldn't be too disappointed. The menu has changed a couple times in recent years (no garlic shrimp just fried shrimp, no French fries, optional Asian salad) but the mac salad has remained the same. There isn't much to choose from for the non-meat eater. The fried shrimp is too oily for my taste."
2,"This is a solid place for those seeking Hawaiian food since it's not a very common type of food found in this area that I have seen.  I tend to favor the Chicken katsu which is served with boiled cabbage, steamed white rice, and macaroni salad.  \n\nOther items on the menu to take note of would be the Moco Loco and Spam Moco which are also common foods amongst the locals in Hawaii.  If you seek a quick place for some Hawaiian type comfort food this restaurant is pretty good.  With generous portions and plenty of seating, my friend and I tend to go here when we're looking to have a late lunch on the weekends."
3,"I've only been to a Hawaiian BBQ place once. In Clearwater, FL. The place went out of business and I never had Hawaiian BBQ again. *cue sad music*\n\nThis was truly unfortunate because I really liked it. But now *cue the happy music* I've found Ono Hawaiian BBQ!\n\nThe service was a little slow but friendly. The service didn't matter anyway as long as the food was on point... and it was. \n\nI got the Braised Short Ribs lunch plate. It's a special that they're running only until the end of this week, I think. It was only $7.49 and fall off the bone good. It was a braised short rib with carrots served on cabbage. It also came with rice and macaroni salad. This meal made my day.\n\nThey sell Hawaiian Sun canned juices ($1.89). I got the Pineapple Orange. I'm not sure how well it paired with my food but it was refreshing on this hot day. \n\nI can't wait to try their Spam musubi... Aloha Ono Hawaiian BBQ, I'll see you again soon."
1,"Me 10 years ago: Panda Express, mmm good, and they give you lots!\n\nMe today: Panda Express is crap. It's got to be the most average, bland, over-Americanized \""Asian\"" food around.\n\nI challenge you to find more average/below average food chain anywhere in the state."
3,"I was so amused with the storyline of Don Quixote, played out in this ballet performance! I expected to enjoy the story of the lost lovers of all ages, shapes, and sizes.....I never expected to giggle so much at the ballet, though! What fun! The costumes were gorgeous and had just the right \""spice\"" for the period while still showing the fluid movement of the dance. The orchestra did an amazing job with the score in a hall that is well-receiving of this type of sound. \nThis performance was the weekend before Valentine's Day. It was obvious that there were lovers there, enjoying a special theatre treat in honour of their holiday. But there were also plenty of families there with young girls of all ages enthralled with the story - and the audience as a whole was happy to show moments of joy and laughter where the company xpected it!"
0,"I have never written a review before but felt I needed to after my experience with Croque. We order from Croque all the time and most often have the food delivered.  In the past the food would arrive around 20 minutes later than we were told but it wasn't a big deal.  \n\nToday when we ordered we were told our food would be delivered in 30 minutes.  An hour later still no food.  My boyfriend called and the lady told him the food was on the way without even saying sorry or anything.  Another hour went by now we had been waiting 2 hours for our 30 minute delivery.  He called back and told the lady we still had not received our order.  She said it's on its way again.  He told her I hope you are not planning on charging us for this food because we have been waiting 2 hours.  In a pissed off voice she says \""Oh so you want a free meal???\""  After some arguing she said she would not charge for the food.  \n\nTwenty minutes later I received a call from the drive.  She told me her boss said not to charge for the food but demanded... \""you have to tip the driver\"" over and over again.  I told her she could talk to my boyfriend when she got here.  She then called back three more times yelling that we had to tip her.  My boyfriend told her just so you know I was going to tip you but when you deliver food 2 hours late you shouldn't call your customers and demand that they tip you.  Tipping is optional and it's based on performance.  When she got here she rang the doorbell 8 times in a row (No i'm not making this up) \n\nNeedless to say at this point we did not tip her and will no longer be ordering from Croque.  Their customer service is a Croque of $#!%.  (Sorry I had to!!!!)"
4,"I was reading the Talk thread on book clubs and I recalled this place.\nIt is a diamond in the rough and I shall go there this week to pick the cumulative brain of their staff:)\n\nBook Gallery is a place to lose time in the lovely smell of old books.  Remember when libraries had copies of books with cut pages for regular circulation?  When cellophane was a method of book covering? This is that kind of place.  Complete collections of out of print serials, favorites from your parents' and grandparents' childhoods. \n\n In here I have found books printed in foreign languages other than Spanish, British food lore of the 50's and 60's and bookshelves gorgeous enough to lust after in their own right. War historians will find the most dedicated shelf space but there is something for nearly everyone to be had.\n\nI had a lovely game of when-was-it-printed judging only by a given tome's binding one Saturday afternoon at this location.  The constant discoveries of interest kept the game going for at least two hours!"
4,"I love this place. The merchandise is constantly changing and they have the best bedding (and prices) in town. And the reading glasses - cutest ever. Cookware - check. Towels - check. Cutlery - check. Really, this should be your first stop if you need something. And if you're just out shopping - good luck leaving empty handed. \n\nI need to go buy a purse today and there's one I've had my eye on... :) I'm guessing it'll be coming home today."
2,Took my commuter in for an oil change and was very pleased with the cost and speed that it got done.  The location is perfect as well to just take a walk over to Costco to shop or snack while waiting.  \n\nFYI Check for coupons on their Yelp page before going it might save you some money like it did me :)
4,"Reasonable prices for great service (I'm usually out the door for $26 total).  These guys won't let you sit around too long.  If you want to talk, they'll talk - sports, women, whatever.  If you don't want to converse, then you can watch one of the TVs they have at each chair.\n\nEach regular cut ends with a straight edge shave and hot or cold towel, as well as a quick machine massage.  Good guys here, well worth a few extra bucks over going to Cost Cutters etc."
0,"I love getting a shave. Its a personal treat for myself that I try to get once every other month.  I've gone to this V's down the street from me about 4 times for a cut and shave and only twice have walked away happy and those were my first two visits and it just kept getting worse. \n\nTrying to get an appointment on Friday or the weekend is a wasted effort but then again so is trying to make one for any other time. I thought I knew the the drill with this place by now. Close at 6pm no shave appointments past 5pm all of which I can understand for a good cut and shave. \n\nSo today with my girlfriends birthday weekend around the corner I call in and make my appointment at 5pm for a cut and shave knowing full well I had a less than great experience on my last visit. But a boy has a right to dream I guess. I leave work early to be there at 5 mins early only to be told to sit and wait a half hour which sucks but its not the first time they have failed the appointment game for me thus the 5 mins early. But I think I'm getting my shave so I sit and wait my turn.\n\nAfter my wait they get me in the chair and give me the worst speed cut I've ever had. My scalp still stings 2 hours later from the buzzer being dragged through it. After the \""cut\"" the barber (if you want to call him that) asks \""Did you want a shave too?\"". Is it really that hard for someone to tell you up front they don't have time to give you a shave?\n\nI was kind of at a lost for words which wasn't a problem for him because he filled the silence with \""Cause I can buzz it off and save you a few bucks but we need to close our doors\"". Knowing that I have a full schedule till the weekend and thinking it couldn't be worse than me doing it myself I made the terrible mistake of letting him \""buzz it off\"" which is the equivalent of letting someone take an electric sander to your face. No oils, no soothing balm, no warm towel just some deep red scratches and a feeling of dejection. \n\nAll of this, my leaving work early 30 mins early, my wasted 30 mins waiting , my blitz of a hair cut and my 'not shave' with scars included cost me $31. Which is a $13 savings compared with my last visit. \n\nAnd that was and will be my last visit to V's Barbershop."
0,"Went to see Amy on a Groupon.  She did the fastest cut in the west!  It looked Ok, not the greatest (which I expected from this place).  I got home and my son said \""Mom, you have a mullet!\""  Yep, sure enough the cut wasn't even in the back.  I went back in an hour and she got me in to fix it.  Unfortunately, now I'm at home I see it doesn't match the other side of the back of my head.  Ok....if this was Super Cuts or something like that I'd just live with it.  NOT Leiden Mitchell....I guess with a Groupon they give you a half price cut."
4,"One of the best quickie Mexican take-out joints in the valley for everything from simple carne asada tacos to chicharrones en salsa roja. I love that they have authentic, non-Americanized carne options like buche (pig intestines), tripas (beef intestines), lengua (tongue- best I've ever had), and cabeza (beef head). And you know what, each and every one of those weirdo meats are effing delicious. Cooked to perfection. Fall apart tender. Melt in your mouth delicious. So freaking good.\n\nIf they can make beef intestines taste delicious, you bet your ass their traditional meat options like carnitas and pollo are equally as delectable. \n\nThey make their own tortillas and both the flour and corn are tender and flavorful. You'll end up looking forward to that first and last tortilla-filled bite of a burrito, and you'll wish they doubled up their corn tortillas on the tacos. (And don't worry, you don't need a double banger tortilla on the taco. I've only had a corn tortilla disintegrate on me when I've left it to sit and sop up juices for ages.)\n\nMake sure to take advantage of the salsa bar. Get lots and lots and lots of the aguacate sauce. That spicy green avocado sauce is the most amazing condiment. The red and green sauce will suffice in a pinch, but that bright green avocado sauce blows 'em away. The marinated carrots, cucumber slices and radishes are also spot on. Their strange pico with lots of cabbage is a concept I haven't seen anywhere else, but it's crazy complimentary. Give it a whirl.\n\nThe only issue I've ever had is with consistency. Sometimes a burrito will have rice and beans, other times it will be a meat-o-palooza. Not that big of a deal, and certainly nothing that will keep me away from the best quickie Mexican I've had in the valley."
3,"The \""street tacos\"" here are outstanding.  Consistent quality w/ a hot sauce bar that apologizes to no one.  Friendly staff.  Hear me now, believe me later.  Strong."
4,"I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.\nI am just in love with it.\n\nEverytime I go to the US, I have to go there.\nCheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).\nThe meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!!\n\nAlways clean and fresh with friendly staff.\n\nHealthy fast food .....\n\nJust wish that we had it in Canada !!"
2,"This place is always busy, and mistakes are made with otherwise simple menu items."
2,"I have to fall somewhere in the middle on this place. Elie's gets high marks for being a family-run establishment and for having super-friendly and likeable service, but  it falls a little short in the food department. \n\nI can walk to this place from my work, so I decided to do just that one day last week. Alicia B was definitely right when she said that this place is \""dinky\"" - the flooring is old, the tables are dingy, the bathroom is passable, and the \""decor\"" consists of a few potted plants and some framed stock pictures of Greece. I might forgive the extreme lack of atmosphere if I felt that the prices were reasonable, since that would mean that the owners were skimping on style in order to provide a high-quality product. \n\nUnfortunately, the food doesn't quite deliver, especially given the high prices. I really wanted to order one of the vegetarian combo plates, but the cheapest one with falafel (plus hummus) was $7.85! That is really steep, in my opinion. If I had wanted to add baba and tabouli, it would have run me $9.10. Because this felt high, I ended up getting the falafel sandwich for $5.59. It only came with lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini sauce, so I ended up adding green peppers for $.45 (a bargain compared to the $.99 they charge to add tomatoes). \n\nI waited 10-15 minutes for my food, which I understand given that there was a steady flow of eat-in and take-out customers. When the sandwich did arrive (with a smile from the again very friendly owner), I enjoyed it because I was starving, but again, wasn't all too impressed. The pita was very large but very dry, and it definitely could have stood to be more moist. Similarly, I found the falafel overly dry and crumbly. The tahini sauce was decent but not as subtle as some I've had in the past. \n\nFor $8 or so, I got a filling falafel sandwich and a large Diet Coke. I definitely prefer the $2.99 falafel sandwich at Al-Hana, although the uber-convenient location of Elie's may mean that I return a few more times. I will definitely update if I go back and try something more on-point."
2,"I'm Yelping about this Fazoli's because I had the most amusing, but at the same time frustrating, experience trying to obtain dinner for my fiance and I last night.\n\n\""Baked Spaghetti Parmesan with Meat Balls, and Meat sauce instead of marinara.\"" I was instructed specifically to say it just like that, and that I did.\n\nI ordered a Caesar salad, bread sticks and a Roasted Turkey sandwich.\n\nI'm patiently waiting for my order.\n\nAs the food order starts to take shape behind the counter, I see her stack a dish that I didn't order on top of my sandwich and attempt to place it in the bag.\n\nIrritated, I exclaim, \""Excuse me? What is that you just put in that bag?\""\n\n\""Spaghetti with Meatballs\"", she said.\n\n\""I didn't order that. I ordered Baked Spaghetti Parmesan with Meat Balls, and Meat sauce instead of marinara.\""\n\nShe makes a second attempt to make the order correctly. This time, Baked Spaghetti with Meat Sauce with a Breaded Breast of Chicken Parmesan comes out.\n\n\""No, that's not it either\"", I explained. \""Can I speak to the person in kitchen?\""\n\nFinally after explaining to the person making the food in the kitchen what I wanted, it was correct.\n\nNormally, that Fazoli's is pretty reasonable. Their pizza has always been extremely mediocre. Other than that, this is my first bad experience.\n\nThe bread sticks were really good that night, so I gave it 3 stars."
1,"Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. \n\nI knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue. \n\nPasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper. \n\nI wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is \""Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea\"". \n\nThere. \n\nThat's classy. And Elite of me. Don't ya think?"
2,The hostess/lady who took my order was very polite and created brief and pleasant small talk. I ordered 2 cheese slices to go and my food was given to me within 5 minutes. The price was reasonable. The pizza was in my opinion slightly above average. The restaurant itself wasn't the most charming and the location wasn't the greatest but not the worst either. But for quick take out it was ok. Giving it 3 stars.
2,More of a 2.5 but I'll give it three because the owner was nice. She clearly knew almost everyone coming in and out of the place and had lots of repeat customers. \n\nThe place is dank and the plastic red table cloths are sticky. The mural is very cheesy and now well-painted. The owner is nice but I have smelled few people who emanate the smell of cigarettes more strongly. It is awful and it made us feel a bit sad/depressed for her. It made the place seem gloomier. And it is NOT appetizing. \n\nThe cheese sticks were ok and the sauce served with them was passable. The pizza was sort of ehhhh...The cheese quality was a bit low and the sauce just didn't work that well as a pizza sauce. Crust was cooked well and had a bit of crisp on the bottom. \n\nI would not come back here. It was middling at best and a bit depressing.
2,"I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect, unique gift. It's really pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot. However, they have complimentary gift wrap and it looks really nice when they're done."
3,"Went there today to get help with ordering unique, cute invites for my sister's baby shower!!  They had the cutest stuff!!!!  And Lydia, the owner was very helpful in making my \""vision\"" a reality.  Great custom stuff!!!  Can't wait til my invites come in!!"
0,I would never go there again. I walked it there and the guy looked at me like I was bothering him. I guess my money will bother him too.
0,"AWFUL experience today...long story short, I am looking for a new dentist. I love our old one, but he's a little far from our house...so, I started by getting recommendations from my area parenting board (the best board EVER). From there I narrowed it down to 3 offices and despite my broken arm, took Truman in his Service Dog vest off to check them out in person. I had a fairly dreadful experience at Dr. Michael Zacher's office. For those of you that don't know, I am a disabled person with a service dog. He is a hypoallergenic poodle and extremely well behaved. I was instructed by Dr. Zacher's Office Manager Rhonda that my dog was not welcome in their office (which by the way is beautiful with tv's, comfy leather sofas and a children's play room). I explained to her that under federal law, a Service Animal cannot be denied access to a facility. And, that I have NEVER in all my time with him (going on 3 years) been asked to leave. I can assure you that I am a very pleasant, nice (even fun) person. Truman was nestled near my feet having a snooze while this happened. He was not in any way disruptive. She told me that she would ask Dr. Zacher. About 15 minutes later Rhonda called back and told me the 'there was not a good fit', and that I could not use Dr. Zacher for my dental needs. I am very upset at being treated in this manner. After all if I had come in with a cane, would I have been denied access? The only recourse I have is to report back to you here and ask you to consider this when making your choices."
2,"We were staying at the Royal Palms for a couple of days and everyday we would have breakfast at T Cooks. It was delicious. \n\nMost memorable the frittata with artichokes and sundried tomates. \n\nDinner wasn't so great - I wouldn't recommend. The dishes were too strongly flavored for the ingredients. I had a mushroom soup that I couldn't finish - it was way to intense.  Also had a monkfish wrapped with bacon which is normally a great combo but I'm not sure what oil they fry with or what amount they used, the dish was over powered and the freshness of the ingredients were lost."
4,"Mmmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm...Never Fails...\n\nThis place is UNBELIEVABLE for breakfast and Lunch (i have heard great things about dinner as well although i have yet to enjoy it).  \ni have only been for lunch twice, but both times were fantastic.  The first time i had the Burger (wonderful) and the second time i believe it was the Halibut (could have been Seabass) and was equally as delicious (i have posted a photo).\n\nWhat i really want to talk about is their Breakfast though...OMG-favorite spot in town.  I am a huge eggs benny fan and they have this Mediterranean version that is out of this world.  It's on Focaccia bread with prosciutto and this red bell pepper hollandaise sauce...SO GOOD (i have also included a photo of this dish).  Also, try their green eggs and ham.  :)\n\nHope you all enjoy this place as much as i do!!  Bon Appetit!"
3,"I had the best experience with breakfast. \n\nThe ambiance- excellent- the reason I am coming back and can have a 5 hour dinner. \nThe service- pretty good\nThe food- from \""ok\"" to \""really good\""  (but not the best)\nI recently had an over saltet paella. \n\nGreat for happy hour, not sure about the quality.. if you want something light - there are not many options. Not good if you are on gluten free, grain free diet.\nDinner/ full menu  has more options for something light. \n\nSecluded and luxurious - a great hideaway from a crazy, busy world  :)"
2,"I just came in for an OJ and one of their fruit cups, I was in a deep craving of fruits and this was the closest spot to me that Thursday that offered such small craving to-go. The service was okay/good. Could have been better."
0,I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.
1,"I have wavered between 1 and 2 stars for this place.  The manager is very helpful and genuinely wants to see your pool clean.  I'll raise it a star for the solid manager.  \n\nI would give it 1 star if not for the good service.  I have owned my house and cleaned my pool for 3 years now.  It has its own share of issues, specially due to its age.  I just got a new pump put in and replaced the sand on my filter.  Everything is now in essentially brand new condition.  I have gone back and forth with them about every single issue I have had.  The last set of advice made my pool virtually unusable for a solid month this summer. \n\n I was told to dump a bunch of crap into my pool to raise its PH.  Two weeks later I put even more chemicals in there to lower the PH, right after it was raised!  I was told every single time I went in that my chlorine levels weren't registering.  I would add more shock, more tabs and whatever product they were selling me.  It seemed to work fairly well for the first year and a half or so, then I would have to drain my pool like clockwork.  I would spend hundreds in chemicals that did nothing.  Then those chemicals I spent hundreds on would require me to drain my pool every couple years!!\n\nMind you, these chemicals are not cheap.  In fact, Leslies prices are consistently 30 - 40% higher than the competition.  I purchased a vacuum head here for $40, only to find the same exact thing at Fry's next door for $25.  \n\nIn short, I was paying hundreds of dollars for chemicals that were causing more harm than good.  My CYA levels were so sky high that they don't even register on the test. \n\nI turned to the internet to find answers to my problems.  I found http://www.troublefreepool.com/ to be a great resource.  I switched to liquid chlorine and stopped using tabs and granular shock.  After a 80% drain of my pool I am back to square one and a recovering pool.  It is quite frustrating to spend hundreds, possibly thousands, on advice that just doesn't work.  I bought my own water testing kit (Taylor Technologies K-2006) and do all my own tests.  My pool chemistry is now in balance.  Something I never had when going to Leslies.  \n\nI'm over you, Leslies."
1,"Not overly impressed. I stopped in with some colleagues while on business in the Phoenix area. I'm trying to limit my meat intake and opted for the veggie sandwich. Major disappointment! I essentially got shredded iceberg lettuce and tomato with some herb spread and a slice of cheese. I think that if a restaurant is going to put out a vegetarian selection they should be a little more serious than lettuce and tomato. Mushrooms, cucumber, romaine instead of iceberg, bell peppers, spinach and avocado are all good options.\n\nI will say that the chips were great and the smell of Cinnabon in the place was divine."
0,"Unless you get Holly to cut your hair avoid this location at all cost. She seems to be the only person in the entire place that understands she is supposed to listen to what the customer wants. \n\nI recently got my haircut there from someone other than Holly and was absolutely butchered, easily the worst haircut of my life. Not only did the \""stylist\"" not listen to what I wanted but she was borderline argumentative. \n\nIn short, if you walk into this location looking to get a haircut and Holly isn't there, just turn around and walk out."
0,"This store discriminates against customers who may have problems carrying items since you are not allowed to take a cart out.  Why is that?  Target next door lets you take your cart to your car, are they discriminating against the Ross clientele (I've seen a review calling this store \""ghetto.\"" I see no difference in Target and Fry's customer base and Ross'.  I did go there because a friend had gotten a good deal on a furniture accessory but then realized I couldn't carry it to my car because of back issues.   I did mention this to security..he said I could drive up (that's a very busy area),I also mentioned it to the cashier and when a very nice man heard me he offered to carry it out to the car.  Also the wait was long because they shut down one register so the cashier could stack up hangars!  so hangars are more important than a line of customers. most of the store was dirty, disorganized, lacking price tags, etc.  never again!"
0,"I am SO mad at this store location today.  It is my son's 3rd birthday and I actually came into the store 10 days ago to order a Planes (the movie) themed birthday cake.  The woman at the counter took my order, my 2nd choice in case it wasn't in, and my phone number.  Nothing.  Until this morning, the day of his birthday.  I received a call saying that the cake was unavailable.  This is not how you should do business.  If the cake is not available today, it wasn't available 4-5 days ago.  GIVE A PERSON A CALL to let me know.  Luckily the Safeway on Chapparal was able to assist, and the cake was WONDERFUL!  \n\nPS - it wouldn't let me post ZERO stars..."
4,"I had an absolutely stellar experience at All Smiles.  \n\nI finally got dental insurance, and made an appointment based on Alicia's review.  It helps that it's right down the street from my house too!\n\nEveryone was just great.  The hygienist was sweet and chatty, and let's just say the dentist isn't too hard on the eyes, ladies....  He has some beautiful blue eyes!\n\nI am just so pleased with the cleaning and service I received.  I will recommend All Smiles Dental to anybody!"
0,"I gave all smiles rave reviews initially but since then have had a horrible experience there.  First, they screwed up in scheduling my cleanings and much to my surprise, billed me $82.  What?  My cleanings are free!  If that is not so bad, I guess I'm just livid that I received a threatening letter in the mail saying that I had been disregarding my bills for months now and would have to pay in full.  IT WAS THE FIRST SUCH BILL I HAD RECEIVED! When I called the office they said they do the \""best they can\"" in scheduling appointments so that the insurance covers it but there are over 1100 insurance companies and they are \""not perfect\"".  Funny, I have been going to the dentist for years and have NEVER had to pay for a cleaning!  And for the nasty billing letter threatening to turn me over to collections ...  I MUST have received the other bills because they show they mailed them!   This place has gotten roughly $2000 from me in 1 year and $850 (+$82 now) out of my own pocket.  All Smiles, this is some \""thank you for your business\"".  I will never be back!  BEWARE!"
0,I used to go to Ingleside animal hospital for all my pets needs. I had a very sick kitty that they could not figure out what was wrong. The only option was exploratory surgery for an amount that was way out of my budget. I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal.  I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply.\n\n A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect  Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes. I have no proof but I will never pass on a chance to warn other cat owners to avoid them I will never return there and am so much happier with BCAC. I live in tempe now but will gladly drive to BCAC.
4,"My girlfriend and I wanted a weekend getaway.  We found the Royal Palms Resort and gave it a try.  It was a little pricey, but it was well worth it for the atmosphere and experience.  We loved the Hacienda feel of the property and enjoyed the time at the pool.  No rowdy kids were to be seen and everyone was enjoying the sun and quiet.  The whole evening was quiet.\n\nThe room we stayed in was also amazing!  It consisted of a tile shower and shutters in front of the bath tub.  It was fun to get away for a weekend.  We even ate at TCooks restaurant.  The food was expensive but we enjoyed being pampered like royalty.  Oh and the drinks we just as great!\n\nI would go back to the Royal Palms anytime.  Definitely recommend it!"
0,"This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting."
2,"Meh..not particularly memorable.\nI've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving. \nThe cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass. \n\nWarning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall. \n\nGo to Opa Grill next door instead."
0,"Really mediocre, just plain jane boring sandwiches.  They skimp on key ingredients, like cream cheese on the lox sandwich on pumpernickel, which btw the bread tastes stale and the worst pumpernickel I have ever had, not fresh or nice tasting at all.  Just really not a very good place and not very good sandwiches.  The thing that really earks me and inspired me to write the review is their cocky name Sacks \""Art of Sandwicherie\"".  There is NO art going on here, just plain boring commercialized sandwiches that sound good but disappoint.  I will never be coming back, there are much better alternatives.  Basically anything other than subway will win this place out.  What a disappointment."
1,Unimpressed and disappointed. There is nothing to these sandwiches. There are so many other places to get better sandwiches. Will not be returning.
2,"I've been here a couple times... very dive-y.  There is a very specific crowd of regulars here that know everybody. \n\nThe girls are ok. (sorry ladies)  There is a wide variety of types of ladies there... tall, skinny, wider, dark, light, almost naked, almost fully clothed... \n\nWe walked in once at about 1am... only an hour left before they closed.  They wanted to charge us the full cover. Eff that!!  So our buddy showed up who's a regular and we got in for free. haha  Good to be with the \""in\"" crowd here."
2,"It's a little overrated - but as another reviewer wrote, it's very much like something you would find in California... with a pizza joint attached. I actually think their sandwiches are shitty in the grocery section and their prices suck, but it's nice to have something like this place in town. It keeps the people it attracts from wherever I like to go - kinda like fly paper for yuppie scumbags. \n\nActually I think they did a pretty good job with it and I wish it wasn't so packed all the time. I can see why it's so popular. Parking is a nightmare and waiting in line blows. There's nothing I could say that hasn't already been said, but I just wanted to post my score and add my 2 cents."
4,"One of my favorite places to grab a quick bit, a delicious dessert, or something fun from the the store!"
3,"Went here for lunch Saturday afternoon with a party of 4.  I've been here about a zillion times yet this is my first review.\n\nI really hate going here but I love to eat here.  Let me explain:  The parking situation is a complete clusterfuq as is the ordering and seating process.  It is basically a yuppy free-for-all in the place.  The place where the line forms is full of stupid bric-a-brack and chatzkies.  All that crap should be removed for more seating and hopefully a less cluttered area.  Aside from that, the ordering your food and picking it up process is pretty haphazard and is not helped by tons of people trying to make their way through the place filled with shelves of random stuff.\n\nHOWEVER.....\n\nEVERYTHING and I do mean EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious.  Breakfast to lunch and everything in between is excellent.  You really cannot go wrong.  Even their pre-made salads are excellent.  Their menu is not too complicated but it is very well thought out and I bet they have some of your favorites, but with their special twist.  Anyway, everything is top notch."
2,"Parking SUCKS.\nEverything is over priced. \n\nIt took me 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee, and I wouldn't have minded the wait if someone had acknowledged my presence and given the polite \""I'll be with you as soon as possible\"" report. Clearly, that was too much to ask for.\n\nBut if you happen to go when it's not busy (i'm not sure when this is...) I'm fairly certain the ambiance would be delightful. It's an interesting concept. Also, the spaces are WAY too tight for the type of traffic they have in there.\n\nThe gelato on the South side of the building is really bland and boring. I'd rather eat store brand ice cream. Their Pizza is really awesome, though.\n\nGreat idea - mediocre execution."
3,Went there the next day and had the chicken salad sandwich which was superb.  The people are friendly and attentive.
3,"I stop for their great coffee every morning -- and only drive by when I can't manage to get a parking spot.  LGO also has really great unique gifts that have come in handy for Mother's Day, Christmas and \""just because\"" cards and notes."
3,"Yum!\nCute, cute place!!  Go for specialty groceries, pastries, or a quick lunch or breakfast."
3,"We're regulars at LGO. Amazing desserts, delicious homemade English muffins (can't go wrong with the commuter sandwich w/ avocado and bacon). They sell a great bottle of inexpensive wine- Klee. And always revolving retail area w/ unique gifts. Great place to eat, shop & relax."
4,"this place is amazing!  everything is made to order and they have fantastic breakfast dishes and a great selection of bread, beer, wine and cheeses.  i was very impressed with the quality of their food, espresso and cleanliness of their store.  it is dog friendly and a great place to eat.  i hope to come back to this place whenever i am in town---they offer something for everyone and also have a very good gift shop with shirts, cards and books and other unique stuff.   for those seeking quality food at reasonable prices, this place is very hard to beat.  i only wish they had one of these in Seattle."
4,Wow this place is awesome and very cool vibe\nI had the commuter sandwich with avocado to die for \nMy wife loved her ham and kale quiche \nKids can't get enough of the fruit parfait \nWish I could have breakfast here everyday\nHas a line but moves very quickly
0,"Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness, holes and flavor. Not impressed at all."
1,"Ok, so you bake the English Muffins..we get it, but are they really worth 10 bucks for 6 of them? This is the theme of this Arcadia joint. The prices for stuff at dinner are unreasonable. It is at least 14 bucks for a burger on a very limited menu after 5pm. The sandwiches at lunch seem tastier and are better priced, so why not serve them all day, plus you cannot find a parking spot during the day either. They also own the fancy pizza place and some joint across the street as well. I ended up with a $3.25 Gluten free Chocolate chip cookie and it was big and gooey and had a bunch of nuts. Not too bad for a cookie in that category. Break the bank at dinner and watch all the lovely Arcadia types wander into this family friendly domain."
2,Overly priced :/ they do not clean under nails. Very nice workers though. Great customer service. ;)
4,"Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \""happy hour\""; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!"
2,"Imagine if you took an Italian deli and dressed it up and put the sandwhiches on menus instead of a chalkboard and provided mood lighting and had a metrosexual waitstaff bring the sandwhiches to your table.  That's essentially Postino in a nutshell.  It's next to the ever trendy La Grande Orange which just adds to its hype.  Seriously, I could start serving twinkies and pbj's  next to La Grande Orange and i would have 91 reviews with 4 stars too.  The food was unspectacular as I felt like I was eating lunch but paying 3 times for it.  The service was average. The waitstaff was not rude but they were not helpful either as we had to constantly remind them to bring items; they took nearly 20 minutes to take our order and you had to ask them for anything extra like water or silverware.  It just seemed like the owner walked into Six lounge and asked some people to be servers; they just seemed as if they had no experience waiting on people. \n\nFurthermore, it's not a \""winecafe.\""  It's just a cafe. The wine part makes it sound trendier than it is. The wine selection is a joke and there are hardly any \""by the glass\"" selections. The servers have no clue about wine and if you ask them a few questions, you will see they do a really good job trying to b.s. you but if you have any knowledge about wine like I do, you enjoy the spectacle of seeing them trying to sound intelligent: \""Er, do you like white or red wine\"" \n\nThe food was good but again, why am I paying a lot of money to be served this for dinner. There are several panini Italian lunch delis that i could get this same food at. \n\nThis is a great place for a light meal or a cocktail or a great place for friends to meet at for a quick drink before heading out to the clubs or lounges.  It's also a great place to impress a date (if you are less than 25 years old).  However, Postino should not be viewed as serious fare in regards to dining.  I would say Postino was a nice experience but I certainly wouldn't return unless I was meeting a group of people there."
3,"Decided to try this place out after hearing how great it is from both the reviews on here and from word of mouth. It is an awesome little hangout spot with a great selection of wine and beer and you can't go wrong with any food consisting of bread, brie, prosciutto, figs and the like.  The valet parking and the Range Rovers out front made me nervous for the clientele that comes here (as my boyfriend and I pull up in my Kia) but I have never had such excellent service.  In fact when we walked in we were slightly overwhelmed and didn't quite know who to talk to about a table when the hostess walks up to us and asks if we needed help and my boyfriend blurted out \""we don't know what we're doing!\"" and without even smirking she said she'd take our name for our table of 4 and then come find us when one was available, in the mean time we could get a drink and wait at the cocktail tables. Not 30 seconds from when we walked over to the table another waiter walked up to us and asked if we needed a drink and showed us the drink menu. All this at 6:30pm on an already busy Friday night! About 15 minutes pass, our friends show up, we have our drinks and then a section of the bar opens up at the end that nobody else has taken so another waitress/hostess/whatever asks us \""are you a table of 4? would you like to sit here?\"" We aren't fussy so we just sit and here we are the rest of the night. My friend even got a free Fish Head (Dogfish?) beer for just being right there when they accidentally poured the wrong one for another patron. I'll definitely have to check this out again on one of the happy hour nights, our waiter got me with the \""Bruschetta Board and bottle of wine for $20 on Tuesday nights\""!"
3,"OK. I realize that I look like a huge softy with the stars but I really do love postinos. My world revolves around their bruschetta. I mean, ricotta with dates and pistachios (!) Most amazing thing ever. The apple, brie, and fig spread is pretty spectacular as well, not that I've found one I don't like. The wine, sangria, and prices are all good. The only thing that tends to be lacking is the service, but only in speed. I'd say they need a few extra hands but that would just add more bodies to an already packed house ( I have never seen this place slow) so I'm perfectly content sitting back and waiting. Give yourself some time if you plan to visit, just sit back and relax, when your server does get there they will be friendly, the wine will be good, and the bruschetta will be delicious."
4,"My wife and her friends have raved about Postino and I finally had my chance to take in Postino a few days ago. \n\nThe bruschetta is excellent. I had a hard time determining which was my favorite, but the white bean and tomato barely edged out the salami/pesto and mozzarella and tomato and basil. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the 8-10 choices on the menu.\n\nI was very impressed with the food. I ordered the Nine Iron Panini and really enjoyed my meal. The panini was cooked perfectly. The chicken, bacon, mozzarella and dijonnaise went very well together. \n\nOften at trendier places, I'm not full after my meal. Postino filled me up though.\n\nThe service was very good. Our waiter was attentive to our needs and provided the check in a timely manner.\n\nI can see why this place is popular. Very good food, nice atmosphere and a place to enjoy some wine with friends in a casual setting. \n.\nThe only downside is the limited parking and valet parking."
4,"I may be alone in this, but I think the above ratings, more than anything else, are about the way a restaurant makes you feel. Postino makes me feel like I've enjoyed an evening out, like I've gotten full on yummy food made from quality ingredients, and *almost* like I don't miss New York (my home for the past 6 years). The atmosphere is lively and the service has always been friendly and attentive. The pub board and bruschetta (esp prosciutto & fig) are delicious and cut into portions perfect for sharing. Go with friends, enjoy the wine list, don't over-order on the food, and Postino will make you feel good, too."
1,"I loved Postino's. Loved, as in past tense. Living in the area for the last several years, Postino's was my go-to place for everything from Saturday night celebrations to making a Monday just a little special. The wine is great, the menu is perfect, the ambiance is downright delightful. It's the staff that makes me cringe. On a recent visit, the snobby hostess told us the wait was 2 hours... But no one was there ... And there were empty tables ... Something did not seem right and when I asked her about it again, she rudely just stared at me. 2 hours later, we got seated and ignored. It took another hour (!) for our bruschetta to arrive to our table. We left feeling hungry  and  neglected. The worst part is that I started to ask around and I have three (3) other friends with almost the exact same experience. After so many happy years at Postino's, I won't go back to the Arcadia location. On the bright side, the Central location boasts the same menu minus the horrid staff."
4,I LOVE this place!  My sister jokes that the only reason she comes to visit me in Arizona is for Postino's!
4,"I can see why people are just packing it in here. A great place for visitors and locals.\n\nWonderful atmosphere. Quality wines and great gnoshing dishes. There is a friendly, knowledgeable staff to advise folks about there options. Top notch bruschetta with a great combination of fresh ingredients. Brie and apple, dates with pistachios being my favorites.\n\nMake reservations because the beautiful crowd is huge. \n\nBest deal ever, happy hour - $5 wine by glass is the best deal before 5pm"
4,"I really enjoy this place! From the eclectic beer and wine list to the amazing staff and good tunes, this place is great. The staff is super friendly and always on top of it. I operate a restaurant and looking at this place I love so many things about it. If you have not been this is the one to go to. Central is also good, but not quite as good as this one and Windsor if you are in search of the cocktails! Always a pleasant experience and simple, but delicious food..  The Italian picnic salad is one of my favorites!\nThanks Postino and thanks for hiring good people."
4,Came here with some girlfriends for an afternoon bite/happy hour. I'm from Minnesota. Happy hour seven days a week is unheard of. What a deal. Especially with $5 glasses of wine! Any single one on the menu. \n\nThe bruschetta is amazing--recommend the apples and goat cheese. De-lish!\n\nService could be toned down somewhat; very helpful but maybe a little TOO helpful.
2,"Really great atmosphere, wines, etc... but I didn't think the food was very good, so I give it only 3 stars.  The bread is very thick and maybe uncooked, no oil.  It was not what I expected.  I was hoping for crunchy bread with creatively delicious toppings.  The toppings are great combinations, just not executed like I expected.  I thought the bruschetta would be warm, but instead it was cold, nothing melded, and the bread was very large.  Great concept, but I don't get all the great reviews."
4,"I have only gone to Postino during the Monday/Tuesday $20 nights where you get a bottle of wine and choice of 3 bruschettas for the cheap price of $20.  I always order a bottle of moscato d'asti and a trio of Brie & Apples with fig, Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and Fresh Mozzarella with tomato and basil.  I usually go with a few of my girlfriends and this makes a great meal with fantastic wine and some good gossip. :)  Come early as seats fill up extremely quickly and the wait can get very long.  This deal starts after 8pm."
3,"This place always has a fun vibe and a great patio. Love meeting girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta.  Good service and nice atmosphere, a true staple."
2,went here to celebrate an interview my wife went to.\n\nHad wine. Thats about it. Love going to sit and relax and have a glass of wine (or beer). \n\nThey try and keep their atmospheres similar between the one on central and here.\n\nThis one feels more condesnsed than the one on central. Obviously i prefer centrals location and atmosphere better.\n\nFood is the same at both places.
4,This place is amazing! Location is easy to get to and valet is Perfect! It's free and I didn't mind paying a few bucks for the convenience! The food is great! Came here for a brunch with some girlfriends on a Saturday morning! They were willing to give us a nice comfy couch area for our group of 6-7. We all got mimosas and our server offered to just grab us a bottle since it would be the same price ($5/each). Yum! I had looked up reviews before going and was all about ordering the bruschetta but my friends were feeling the brunch items. Everything looked so tasty! I ordered the prosciutto and Brie panini and chips. Oh my gosh soooo very flavorful!!! It was in the sweet side due to the fig but so many flavor profiles in each bite! I can't wait to come again. I hear they have deals on Monday and Tuesday nights for wine and bruschetta!
0,"Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home."
4,I am such a fan of this place. Husband  (who is more fried food and french fries sort of guy ) took me as a surprise for a date night. WHOLY AWESOMENESS.  Great GREAT brushetta (Even the husband liked it) and a great wine menu. I think I ordered everything that was remotely vegetarian. DELICIOUS. Seriously. I hear there is one in my neck of the woods (Ahwatukee).. can't wait to visit.
2,"Why the hell does everyone have stuffed animals?!\n\nApparently, they give you a stuffed animal after taking your order so when you're seated, they know what table to deliver the food to. I thought it was a just a nice gesture so I said 'No thanks' to the dirty stuffed animal. Then I wondered why the food never came.\n\nChuy's reminds me of the surf n' turf taco shops by the beach. I like the meat and seafood options and especially the smell of grilled food but the flavor could use a lot more spice. The menu was expansive and offered a lot. Too much to list and I think they even have fried chicken? Weird. \n\nI ordered the Broiled Whitefish Taco Platter ($6) with a side of Shrimp Skewers ($4). The shrimp skewer was awesome, sprinkled some lemon juice on it with some hot sauce and that was a better meal than my taco platter. The fish didn't taste 'fresh\"" and I'm not exactly sure what whitefish is either. The rice and beans were standard. The cabbage salad could use some help. It was chopped cabbage with a vinaigrette. \n\nI was not impressed by Chuy's but I could go there again. It's a safe option, maybe next time I should try their $2 margaritas that they serve all day, every day. Now we're talking!"
0,"This place is the dive bar of grocery stores. Congrats Fry's! You popped my 1-star cherry.\n\nIt is only due to my current boycott of Target that I brought my business to the Fry's next door. This decision was based on principal, but I have to say I have missed Target.  \n\nWhen I walk through the front doors I just feel miserable. The 'energy-saving' automatic lights make me seize. The narrow aisles make me claustrophobic. The overall dinginess consumes me. I'm suddenly overwhelmed with an anxious feeling similar to when I brought a bad report card back to my parents. Or when I had to confront an ex-gf's parents about why the Pennsylvania State Troopers were calling them at 4am. \n\nMy pace quickens. My pupils dilate. The lump in my throat expands. I try to gasp for air, but the weight on my chest suffocates me. I feel lethal; on the verge of frenzy. My mask of sanity is about to slip. Sweat beads down my back. My aggressiveness becomes visible. The curmudgeon at the self-checkout grunts at me. Darkness comes over me...\n\nI reemerge 36 hours later with no semblance of reality. Fry's is a catalyst of my psychosis."
2,"I'm conflicted on this location. On one hand, they are very close to home for me. The store is relatively clean. The service is ok. My main concern is the very limited selection of organic food. I would rather buy my organic food here, but often have to get it at the much more expensive Whole Foods. Pity"
1,"Kroger: ruining Frys one transaction at a time. \n\nToday's visit started with a coffee from the deli.  After Jeffrey took my money, I discovered there was only powdered whitener. \""No problem,\"" I say, \""it's a supermarket, there's cream in the store.\""  \""No, I can't go and get cream from the dairy department,\"" says he, \""it has to come from the warehouse.\"" \""May I have my money back?\"" I ask.  \""No, I'm not authorized to give your money back,\"" says he.  \""Here's your receipt.  You'll have to go to Customer Service.\""\n\nOn my way to customer service, I stop at the dairy case for an 88\u00a2 carton of milk, believing that Customer Service will see the logic of placing said carton at the Deli counter.  Along the way I am \""greeted\"" by Kelly, the Store manager.  I explain my strategy for customer service.  \""We can't do that,\"" he says of the milk, \""it ends up going bad.\""  Why is there no cream; why can't the clerk make refunds? I wonder aloud.  \""There's a problem with the warehouse; ever since Kroeger took charge,\"" seemed to be the mumbled response. \n\nMoral: fry's shoppers be wary--make sure your order is correct before giving over your money.  Or consider Basha's."
3,"I have read some of the Yelp reviews and at my first visit at the Ingleside Grooming I was not too impressed with curt response to some of my questions as she seemed initially annoyed with my presence, however, I continued to request their services to groom my pet.  When I returned the next day with my pet, I was significantly late at dropping her off for her appointment.  I also told her that my pet is a nervous pet and has always pooped whenever I took her to Petsmart or to the vet.\nThe person who was there (the same person whom I spoke to the day before), I apologize and she was very understanding and did not seem upset at all for my tardiness.  I felt really comfortable at that point.  When I returned to pick up my pet the same person who I have been dealing with was so nice and told me how my dog behaved and how sweet she was and, best of all, didn't poop!  And my dog's new look (she's 3 years old and never had a hair cut, so she was pretty bushy) is fantastic!  and the cost is very reasonable with what comes included!  I highly recommend her!"
1,"Firstly, this is Arizona turn the air conditiioning on! Normally I am not big on atmosphere, but when its 80 degrees plus outside, I expect a comfortable temperature. I had to sit outside since the inside was stuffy, and the black curtains did not do my comfort level any justice. \n\nNow that I am done ranting a bit, lets get on to the food. At this point, unfortunately, it does not get any better. We ordered the Pasteles, a tamale with pork, plantains, raisins, and spices, for an appetizer, and it was not that great. The masa was a bit dry, and the flavors weren't as scintillating as I expected, especially for the price. \n\nFor our entrees we had the Ropa Veija (shredded beef in spices with black beans and rice), which once again was not anything spectacular. This was the highlight of the meal, which to me is sad. The beef was a bit tough and the moros (rice and black beans mixed) was dry. Sadly, our other entree was much worse. This title is held by the Pollo Cubano (marinated chicken breast with onions). The chicken was tender on the bright side, but it was covered with onions that were disgustingly soaked in lime. The flavor was overwhelming and I could taste nothing other than lime. \n\nConsidering the price, atmosphere, and quality of Havana Cafe's food I will never return. If you must try this restaurant, I ask you to please not order the items mentioned above."
2,"I came here for the second time last night.  Audrey W and I met Amy B for dinner.\n\nI opted for the special and kind of regret it.  It was a seafood paella.  I have to remind myself sometimes that I don't live by the ocean anymore and very few restaurants here in the valley provide good quality seafood dishes along the lines of the paella.\n\nIt was mediocre and I know many other things I have had at Havana Cafe are much better.\n\n:-( \n\nI'll just have to bank on my upcoming dinner at Wildfish for Restaurant Week to set me right.  I'm having the cioppino.\n\nI used to order things like cioppino or \""Fruite de Mare\"" all the time when I lived in Boston and I always enjoyed it.  Two times ordering that sort of thing at restaurants in Phoenix and :-(  \n\nLesson learned."
1,"I have never written a review, but the food at Havana Cafe was so underwhelming (and not in the least bit good) that I feel compelled to share. \nI ordered the Pollo Ajillo which, in reality, was a pile of salt with a side of chicken and rice. I opted for Arroz con Gandules instead of white rice as it has been years since I have had this tasty Puerto Rican side. The whole thing was almost inedible... I came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately, it was so bad!  My husband had the Pollo Cubano, which was equally underwhelming and nothing that we could not make at home ourselves.  The restaurant gets an extra star for the wonderful Cafe Cubano and the extremely attentive wait staff .  I had high hopes for this place but the next time I have a craving for Cuban food, I will be heading to Sabor Cubano."
2,"We usually go to the one on Bell Rd in N. Scottsdale but were in the area so tried this second location. I again had the Berenjena con Garbanzo, and it was again just as lovely. If your a fan of eggplant you've got to try it!\n\nI usually order it with peas instead of rice and so expected it, but they didn't have peas so instead had the black beans on the side. It was different from how I am used to eating it but it was still very good! \n\nThe black beans are good. It was the first time I had them so the unexpected change was good. They also didn't have the usual asparagus so brought me a little salad of cabbage and some sort of vinaigrette? It was delicious and somewhat like coleslaw but also completely unique.  Again a nice switch up from the norm. \n\nI agree with most of the other views that the price is a little high for the type of food, but having had my experience with Cuban food in Miami on many trips I can say its decent. So is worth it every now and again. \n\nOur service at this location was also great. Very attentive and lots of check in's to see how we were.\n\nI actually think the plastic chairs lend to the \"" feel\"" of the place. If you have ever spent time in Little Havana or off the beaten path away from South Beach, or Lincoln Rd in Miami, you know what I mean. But I think it supposed make you feel as if your \""patio\"" dining, in the tropics even inside here in AZ."
1,"I have to say, I was very disappointed with my dining experience at Havana Cafe last night... the place smelled wonderful upon walking in and everything tasted okay (though not as fresh as I would have expected for the price), but I was thrown off-guard by the plastic chairs and frozen fishstick-resembling appetizers!\n\nThe sangria is delectable and, in the moment, I enjoyed the ceviche. However, the tapas sampler was incredibly disappointing... I've traveled throughout the Latin Caribbean and this food did not meet my expectations. \n\nMost importantly, though, I awoke in the middle of the night to horrible cramping, chills, and diarrhea that kept me up for hours. I have strong reason to believe this was food poisoning from the restaurant (given I didn't eat anything else last night) and I have every intention of pursuing a full refund."
1,"I came to the Phoenix location for lunch through Groupon.  I ordered the beef brisket called Ropa Vieja, which was very tough and like eating strands of rope.  I could see where it got it's name \""ropa\"", because it is like cooked strands of rope. There was plenty of meat, but the flavor was all boiled and leached out of the meat.  It was served to me like a stew , but the beans and rice side and the ropa was swimming in a plateful of water almost to the edge of the plate.  The ropa stew had no flavor, like it was boiled in a big potful of plain water that kept getting changed.  I had to add a lot of salt., shake more and more and more salt on it.   It was very ICK to me.   I wish I ordered the cerviche instead.  I didn't think the ropa was worth it even with the Groupon discount, I would not want that dish even if it were free, unless I was starving.  I told the waitress it was very bland and asked her if it was normal to have all that water in the plate.   She said it was \""juicey\"", but to me, juice implies flavor, but I guess \""juice\"" for water is a waitress being positive and politically correct on her job.   My jaws were tired trying to chew the strands of \""rope\"".  She did not offer to bring me something else.  She said that was the way it was.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the coconut mini flan with mango sauce, and that was really good!   I'd give it an A and the size was larger than the word mini implies.  \n\nSorry for such  negative review about the ropa, but I tell it like it is, and if I thought it was terrific, I'd surely say so.\n\nMaybe you will find something else on the menu to your liking, or maybe you are less discriminating than I am about tough and flavorless Ropa meat swimming in a plateful of water  (Yes, I know the difference between juice, sauce, soup, and water.).   I consider myself a great cook and I eat out a lot.  \n\nI only tried this Ropa, and it is not good enough to make me wanna give this restaurant another change at my own cost.   The waitress was very nice and attentive though, I have no complaints about her service, but she did not offer me a substitute.  I would have given it a one star, but she was a friendly and attentive waitress."
2,"The food here was good! I had chorizo with scrambled eggs. It was good although I wished I had gotten the carne asada; that is one of my favorites.\n\nMy friend and I saw some characters at this place. I think they come out late at night.\n\n1) A couple walked in and the lady yelled \""ya'll busy\"" - if she looked, she would have noticed that we were the only [two] people in the restaurant besides them. #facepalm\n\n2) A few minutes before we were about to leave two guys walked in with a 12 pack of beer!? I think they left the beer inside while they went out to smoke a cigarette."
1,"Excellent Neighborhood ShitHole ! Consistently inconsistent, seldom open and catering to EVERY demographic in the PHX. \nCan't wait to pass on this place for years to come ! Owner must be proud. \nCheers & good luck"
3,"After searching every nursery we could for 36\"" rose trees this late in the season we found out that Berridge was one of the only that still had them and they had a lot. When I got to the nursery I really like the layout of the plants.  There are also large trees on the grounds that provide nice shade while you are shopping.  I purchased 5 Hybrid-T 36\"" Rose Trees that were listed as \""Firefighter\"" as the color.  There were a couple that did not have flowers on them so there was no way of verifying the color.  Berridge offers a 90 day warranty on these plants, so I wasn't too worried. \n\nAfter planting them and a week later, sure enough one of them was white, and not the red that my fiance so dearly wanted.  Now I'm in trouble!  We call Berridge and they told us to bring it back and they would exchange it.  So now I have to dig this rose tree up and haul it back to the nursery.  Not exactly what I want to be doing.  When I got there I realized that I did not bring the receipt which is the policy for returns.  Not a problem though because Bill came out and assisted me and helped me find a different 36\"" rose tree to replace it.  They did not worry that I did not have the receipt because I had left the tags on the tree.  The staff, especially Bill was knowledgeable and friendly, and was a great help in fixing this situation.  I will definitely return to Berridge and would recommend them to my friends."
2,"Not bad, first time here - I had driven past a few time and decided to finally get some carry out, and man we got the carry out - They gave it to us in a box.  \n\nPlace was nice, it was actually packed when we went in to pick up the food.  Everyone was friendly and the food was ready and perfect.  The reviewed the order with us so we knew nothing was missing.\n\nWe had:\nCream cheese puffs - could have been better, but I still ate them\nWonton Soup - Very good, and really good crunchies\nEgg Roll - I am not a huge eggroll person but was good for an eggroll\nShrimp Chow Mien - I loved this!  Was a really big fan, I hadn't ordered Matthew did and I ended up eating it all\nMongolian Beef - was good, your standard Mongolian beef\nMu Shu Pork - Very good, and something I noticed a couple days later, usually the wrappers get hard and you can use to eat left overs the next day, These wrappers were perfect 2 days later\n\nI think in the end, it probably depends what you like and what you order.  I have had better Mongolian beef, but this place had great pork.  I will go back and for a place that doesn't cost and arm and a leg it works as a neighborhood joint."
1,"I really want this place to be good.  I love seafood and it's only 2 or 3 blocks from where I live.  I've been twice now, and both times it's just been... meh.  It's not bad, but I have no intention of going back.  The plates seem expensive for a joint like this. The chips were too thick. The salsa wasn't that great. And most importantly my fillets haven't been very delicious.  Maybe their shellfish and meats are different, but the fish fillets just aren't worth it.\n\nThe staff is friendly enough, and the service is quick enough, but I don't think I'll be swinging by here again."
4,"Oh. My. Damn!  I effing love this place!  I've been a lot and have always had great food and good service.  The oysters are a must have app, with a little squeeze of lime and a dash of salt...my mouth is watering now!  The little woman and I both usually get one of their cocktails (shrimp, octopus, squid, snail) served with chips and some avocado. The shrimp ceviche is another favorite, nice and limey. The last few times, however, my gal ordered fish.  I believe it was cooked in garlic and butter and came with rice and beans and it was phenomenal!  Sometimes they have live mariachi music, which just adds to the greatness!"
2,"Ended up here after sadly finding out that Garcia's is no longer in the area.  Turned out to be a good lunch nonetheless.  The menu is varied, and there is plenty to choose from whether you're vegetarian (i.e. Japanese Eggplant sandwhich, which I wish I had ordered) or a meat lover (i.e. burger with brie and portobello, which is what my colleague ordered).  \n\nI asked the waitress for her recommendation between the tuna melt and the Japanese eggplant sandwhich.  I know, 2 very different sandwiches, but I couldn't decide.  She said they're both delicious but that \""people come here for our tuna\"".  Sold.\n\nWell, the tuna was good, but I wouldn't say that I have to \""go there for their tuna\"".  It had a different flavor, I'm guessing rosemary, and also had chestnuts in it to add crunch (not a huge fan honestly).  The wich came with a side of fries, which were decent.\n\nAll in all I was a bit disappointed, and wish I had ordered the Japanese eggplant sandwhich.\n\nI may have to return just to try it."
3,"My husband got back today from New Jersey (what a relief he isn't stuck in Hurricane Irene's path anymore!) and since we were in the neighborhood we figured we'd go to Over Easy.  Read my most recent review on how that went (ie, a bust.)\n\nWe stopped at Starbucks at the Safeway next to Over Easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what we'd do.  I turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was Taylor's Cafe open, they do breakfast, and they were only about a mile from where we were.  We decided to give breakfast one more try, called Taylor's and put our names on the list.\n\nWhen we arrived it was a little hard to find, but we called and they told us where it is.  The decor is cozy and inviting.  We waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied, the manager was very attentive.  I told him what happened at Over Easy and he was horrified.  We live in Avondale, we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service.  Let me tell you, Taylor's Cafe really turned the morning around for us!\n\nMy kids each ordered an apple juice, and one got chocolate chip pancakes, the other got strawberry waffles.  Their kids menu is $8 each, but the portions are huge, it's easily something an adult would put away.  I stole a bite from each, they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags.\n\nMy husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage.  With his omelet he got 2 choices for sides, so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese (he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese.)  The chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected.  He also ordered a mocha, which at $4 was about the size of what you'd get at Starbucks, and my husband said that it was on par with their quality.\n\nI ordered the Joe's special, intrigued by the list of ingredients.  It was flavorful and delicious.  The country potatoes were very tasty.  I ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade, it was tangy and sweet, really tasty on a hot summer day.\n\nWe came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good, but not out of this world.  They have fantastic options for the health conscious, and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear.  There is plenty of space (you don't feel like sardines in a can), the staff is polite, competent, and professional,  and the ambiance is nice.  We will definitely be coming back."
3,I am so thankful for yelp or I never would have found this place :) We went on a Sunday Morning/afternoon and were seated fairly quickly the menu is huge and it all looked great I was very pleased I ordered the french toast yum! My honey got the omlette it was good the hash browns are a little more well done than would have liked but still tasty. The staff was friendly and attentive Iwill definaty be back for more :)
0,"Broke a pair of perscription sunglasses at the hinge.  Costco referred me to this place.  They did the repair by afixing new temples.  When I got them out into the sun, they didn't match the frames...the frames were black so it wasn't like it was some freaky color or pattern to match...just black.  When I took them back in to remedy the situation I was informed it was the best that they could do.\n\nA few weeks later the screw came out of the hinge, so I took it back.  I was informed that the policy of the store was not to do any repairs without charging for it....even resetting a screw, which I supplied.  \n\nHow much could it be to reset a screw you might ask? Would you believe $20.00!  I prefer to select who I let screw me, and this dump ain't one of them...."
1,"Pushing the boundary of the Chinese buffet.\n\nGenerally I'll visit an establishment at least three times prior to writing a review.  A second or third visit to Mike Kwan's Gold Coin would be of surprise to me. CASH ONLY, with tax included $6.15 paid for my admission to this buffet-style meal.  Kid's under the age of four eat for $2.  It was surprisingly busy.\n\nThe \""buffet\"", in its entirety:\nWon-Ton Crisps\nFried Rice\nChow Mein\nMixed Vegetables\nFrench Fries\nEgg Roll Halves\nFried Chicken\nHot Wings\nSweet & Sour Pork\n\nHere in lay my greatest criticism; Yes, technically, there is more than one Chinese item among the food set out in large trays for an individual to return to as many times as they like.  In no other way does the Gold Coin overlap with common consumer expectation of a \""Chinese Buffet.\""  So, why was it so busy?  Because, for a tick north of five bucks a person could gluttonously stuff themselves with the above items; it is better thought of as an economical \""family-style\"" meal.  If it was advertised as such, I bet Mike's would get better reviews as people wouldn't feel mislead when they walked in, and the balance of Chinese, to American, to Italian, to Mexican to whatever cultural dishes would be freed up as well.  It has its redeeming qualities, which is why it didn't get the single start rating; it's clean, inexpensive, and seemed like a friendly casual atmosphere."
2,"Its a pretty nondescript dive.  Its basically a hallway, which makes its kind of neat... and there is a big fish tank with weirdly cool fish to stare at.  Otherwise its your typical dive bar atmosphere.  They do have 'fish tank specials' which means that about 10 bottles are lined up in front of the fishies and they are marked pretty cheaply (naturally the price is written in Sharpie on the bottle).  \n\nI wanted to try the 'chocolate vodka' so I basically got a really full glass of straight vodka for $2.50.  Odd drink but lots of alcohol quite inexpensively.  The bartender had to have been high on something.  No complaints though... she was hilarious just to watch.  \n\nI would definitely go back on any dive bar crawl.  - also try Darwins just two doors down!"
3,"In short, the Dilly is a drinker's bar.  Cheap drinks, tons of regulars, and dark enough to make it easy to forget the world outside.  Hipsters beware, this isn't the Little Woody, it isn't the Vig...hell, it's not even Hazelwood's, but it is a great place to unwind.\n\n- pool table, check\n- darts, check\n- TVs, check\n- jukebox, check\n- strange edibles served out of a liquid-filled jar, check\n- seasoned, female bartender that doesn't take shit from anyone, check\n- fellow customer offering to give you a tattoo right there, for free, check"
3,"A trifecta of goodness - service, food, and value.  I stopped in to pick up lunch for a working Saturday at the office.  The value family meals are just that.  Plenty of everything and very flavorful.  Also, it is very clean inside the restaurant and the salsa bar was well stocked and tidy as well."
4,"It's about time that I write a review for La Fontanella given that I've become a regular.  And I live in New York City.  That an Italian restaurant nearly across the country would not only win over my stomach but my heart is a major deal given that I come from the world of great Italian cuisine.  That all being said, La Fontanella continues to exceed my expectations and win over everyone that I bring with me to eat their food.  I feel like an insider at this point given that I've eaten there so often that I ended up having my wedding reception there.  But given that the owners are so present and charming in the place day in and day out, you'll feel like a regular on your very first visit.\n\nI've seen the other negative reviews on here and I have to tell you that if you are looking for a run-of-the-mill, inexpensive red-sauce joint, this is not the place for you.  La Fontanella is for gourmands and romantics who are serious about quality ingredients and dishes prepared with a heavy measure of love.  Everything (and I mean every last thing) from pasta to sauces to dessert is made in house, and special dishes are focused on fresh, seasonal ingredients.  Case in point - we begged for the artichokes in August that we enjoyed in March, but the owner wouldn't dare serve them to us out of season.  Not because she wanted to deny us our request, but that she only wanted to serve us the best of the best.\n\nCutting to the chase, on my first visit we decided to take a tour of the menu and see what would blow us away.  We started with stuffed mushrooms (luscious and savory), artichokes braised in olive oil (garlicky goodness) and the popular suppli (addictive fried rice balls stuffed with oozy mozzarella, served over homemade bolognese).  The appetizers were rich enough to almost make a meal, but we charged forth nonetheless.  We ordered the Seabass Adriatico (hands-down my favorite - moist flaky filet topped with a toothsome dressing of tomatoes and basil), Pork Loin with Fig Compote, simply grilled lamb chops (great with a squeeze of lemon), and Pescatore Diabolo, a fiery assortment of seafood and crushed red pepper over a tangle of fettucine.  Stuffed and happy, we couldn't eat another bite...and yet, we managed dessert - homemade gelato and zuppa inglese.  A night to remember, we lumbered to the car knowing that we had found a new favorite.\n\nOn subsequent visits, we found other new favorites, like the sinfully rich Gnocchi with Prosciutto and Peas (aka the night where my friend Dave asked for thirds on the homemade bread and dipping oil) and the homemade grilled sausage skewers (aka the night where my husband asked if I could go back into the kitchen and beg to learn the recipe).  \n\nIf you are in the neighborhood and are looking for a treat of the most authentically Italian kind, this is the way to go.  From the romantic, candlelit interior, jovial (and often talkative) servers, to the detail placed on quality ingredients, La Fontanella is memorable and instantly lovable.  It is absolutely no surprise that this place has been around since the 80s, and I'm only sad that I hadn't found it sooner!\n\nPS. Know that the place tends to close early - the rush is usually at around 5pm and by 8pm the place is quieting down.  Good to know if you want to beat the throngs (or why it's emptier later at night!)"
3,I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice.  It is an older place with tons of charm.  The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked.\n\nAfter sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.\n\nThe service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.\n\nI would definitely return but hope the service is better.
2,"I don't know that I would have gotten oil changes for a few years if it hadn't been for this place.  \n\nOne stop shopping for getting an oil change and car wash - and there's a Wendy's right next door to grab some grub while they mess with the car.  They've expanded their offerings recently and now they do things from replacing your headlights to changing out belts.  My last trip there was an oil change, new air filter and car wash for $47 after tax.  They also do a basic car wash from $3.99 and a super was from $7.99.  I've never gotten anything but the basic, and I always find things they missed so while I'm not too impressed with their quality, it's nice to have the basics all taken care of in one location. \n\nThey have 48 hour guarantees on the washes, which is nice and when you get work done it always includes a \""limited time\"" coupon for additional work.  Not a bad deal..."
0,"This place is awful!!!!! I've been going to Firestone for yrs all over Arizona. Never ever had an issue until this location!!! Messed up my appts 3 times in one week. I've been here a total of 4 times this week!! Refused to top off all my fluids. Never heard of this before. It's your job!!!! When asking for my keys back, he refused. Then I asked the guys in the garage to give them to me and the GM told me \""to stop being crazy!\"" Excuse me!?! No. Never coming back here again!!! They will screw up everything!!"
0,"I wish I could give zero stars! I should have known better to come back after I was misquoted the price for fluff and fold my first visit here, but I was in a pinch.  I dropped off a large amount of clothing, some wash and some dry cleaning.  I told them when I needed it by, and they said no problem.  They called me later to let me know a lot of the pieces were dry cleaning and they might need longer - I told them I left it with them because I needed it at a certain time and if they couldn't do the job by then I would come by and pick it up.  They said they would have it ready.\n\n$317 later, I have my laundry.  85% of what I dropped off was laundry, but they were so lazy that they dry cleaned 85% of it instead.  I have about 20 cotton, machine wash tank tops that they dry cleaned to the tune of almost $6 a piece!  Are you kidding?  LAZY and UNPROFESSIONAL.  When I got home and realized what had happened, I called to inquire.  The guy on the phone was so rude and accused me of being 'nasty,' said he did me a favor (?) and then hung up on me.\n\nI would absolutely never come back here.  I really can't believe the nerve they had to dry clean so many cotton, machine wash pieces, and then tell me they did me a favor while sticking their hand in my wallet.  LAZY LAZY LAZY."
4,"Do you like sliders?\nYup, I do too! I admit it, as much as l enjoy fine dining, I really do have pedestrian tastes.\nYou can only eat eat so much pate and stuffed breast of duck before you need something real.\nI know sliders are everywhere these days. I live near Stax and I like it fine. \nI see sliders on the menu so many of the other places I go, but these...these are really sliders and they are really great and really just what god and nature intended when ground beef was created! \nSmall, delightful chunks of bovine goodness!\nPlus, Chicago Hamburger has some of the best chili fries around to go with the sliders, and that really makes the drive, and the poor parking at lunch and the difficulty finding a place to sit at lunch and all the rest (I actually feel like I'm in Chicago) worth the effort!\nThe regular burgers and the hot dogs are pretty good , too (bright green relish and celery salt for the dogs, so good for them), but really...sliders are the reason to go to Chicago Hamburger."
2,"My buddy took me to this place, I had some sliders and a couple hot dogs, The sliders are very simular to white castle's and I wasn't very impressed with the dogs but it was fairly cheap and you got a lot of food. Fun little location. I did buy a shirt haha."
4,1/3 cheddar burger with all toppings.  You wish more places and owner/operators existed like this.
0,"The food was great, the customer service was horrible! I called in an order and asked for it to be split into three. When I arrived to pay the man at the register basically scolded me telling me he wasn't going to make other people wait in line while he split my order. The person on the phone did not tell me this was a policy. I won't be back. He was rude and it was completely uncalled for. Maybe the person taking phone orders needs some training!"
4,"Where has this place been all my life?\n\nBest burger on this side of town. I'd recommend the full-size burgers over the sliders, which, while still delicious, somewhat pale in comparison.\n\nGenerous portions for a very reasonable price.\n\nWhen I worked close by, I'd try to eat here once a week for a daily special that I liked."
3,"They quoted me 15 minutes, and just 10 minutes later called my name to say it was done. Quickest oil change I've ever had.\n\nPaid $38 and some change with the $5 off Ladies' Wednesday discount."
4,"Early on a hot Saturday morning, we headed to Baker Nursery to find new plants for our landscaping adventure. What a lovely nursery! It was well organized with plenty of shade so you didn't have to wander the aisles with the sun blazing down. All the plants looked so healthy and beautiful. My husband and I are both pretty uneducated when it comes to plants. We had so many questions, and there was always someone there to tell us about the plant, what kind of soil, sunlight and water it needed, etc. I wanted a particular cactus that our neighbors have in the front of their house, but I didn't know it's name, so we played a kind of Pictionary meets Pantomime in describing it.  It took about 10 seconds for the gentleman to understand what I was talking about, pointed us in the right direction and picked the healthiest of the bunch. We loved the personal attention, and we were grateful to all the people who helped schlep the plants up to the front for us and load them in our vehicle using plastic to make sure the dirt didn't dirty the car.  Two weeks later and all our plants are thriving! Whether you're a seasoned gardener or newbie to the plant world, your time won't be wasted at Baker Nursery, and you'll get the best of the best in terms of plants and service!"
0,"I purchased a Banana Tree from Baker's on 06/15/2014.  It wasn't in very good condition to begin with and they only had 2 others.  The salesperson indicated that if it didn't do well that I could bring it back.  On 7/29/2014 I took the plant back in the pot it came in and with the receipt.  Baker's refused to give me another Banana Plant, give me my money back or give me a credit for another plant.  This family owned business needs to be bought out by someone with some ethics.  I will never shop for plants there again and I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau."
4,"Bakers Nursery is where I've spent the majority of my weekend mornings.  I've either been pointed to a needed plant, or discovered it on my own.  Folks have always been helpful & informative.\n\nI will agree that they are pricey but big box stores cannot compare to the inventory at Bakers. Moreover, I'm do not agree with Yelp colleagues' low reviews. Unfortunately, gardening is 'at risk'. You figure out what your soil & attention span will foster and you are successful with those plants. Indeed, gardening comes with a learning curve that comes with failures & successes.\n\nTheir niche in the neighborhood will be a chasm after December."
4,Best Thai in town. I've been eating here since 1994 or so.
4,Absolutely the best red curry in history.  Wife loved the brocoly chicken.  I live in Idaho and there are only 2 restaurants in Phoenix I go out of my way for.  Thai lahna is one of them..
0,"I have tried this place 4 times. The food is not very good. I have lived in Thai Land but don't expect to get the same excellent food here. I love Thai food and Thai people, don't think much of this place, I live close by but go elsewhere. The food is bland, overcooked and pretty Americanized. I have always been pleasant, patient and courteous but never gotten good service. The servers are lazy and sometimes rude and you are going to wait a longtime for every step of the service process. With so many good Thai restaurants in Phoenix there is no reason to eat here."
2,"Stopped in here on a whim as I was passing by and hungry, plus I love Thai food.\n\nService was prompted and they seem to have quite a few regular customers. I have a yellow curry dish with was flavorful and had just enough spice prepared medium that I have a nice sweat going. They lunch special was very reasonable and filling.\n\nI would stop by again if I'm in the area and have a Thai craving."
0,Perfect on the drop off of rented tables and chairs but when it came to pick up on the Monday morning absolutely useless. My wife and I took a day off work with the plan that we would go out for the day once these people had picked up but when I hadn't heard from them by 11.40 I decided to call. The response was we are running behind schedule because Monday's are always busy but we should be there in another couple of hours so there goes our vacation day wasted. I would not recommend this company.
0,The owner was so rude I walked out! And they only accept cash and the only reason I gave them a star is because the review made me! I mean this guy was ridiculous! I never had anyone greet me at the door like that!!
0,I do not recommend.
4,"Down-home live music dive that's family owned and offers a great value for the money. Cheap drinks, good food, no cover (usually). Opens at 6 am most days. Get over here."
2,"After spending a month shopping around Phoenix for a new sofa, I ended up at Pruitt's today during my lunch hour.  Already grumpy from a frustrating morning, I didn't expect to find much at this store but was encouraged by the mostly-positive reviews.  I had a particular sofa in mind which I'd seen at two Mor locations and pretty much had my heart set on finding it or something very similar.  Thankfully, I found the exact model I was looking for and it was a few bucks cheaper than it was at Mor.  The best part?  Not only was it in stock, but it could be delivered on Saturday and for $30 less than Mor wanted to charge for delivery!  The salesman who helped me, Mark Donohue, was friendly but not overbearing and within minutes my purchase was complete.  Why the three-star rating?  I'm reserving final rating until my sofa is delevered, hopefully in perfect condition.  Once that happens, I'll be back to add at least a star.  In the meantime, if you're searching for something new, give Pruitt's a shot."
1,Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though.
1,Pruitts asked me to email them to allow them an opportunity to make it right. So i did. Haven't heard anything else back.
1,"I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... I will not be returning to (this) Pei Wei any time soon..."
1,"I've tried and tried to find something I like at these restaurants and I just can't come up with a reason to go back. \n\nI tried the Lo Mein with chicken. It smelled good but, what I got was 3 lbs of noodles in an overly sweet sauce with a few julienne carrots and few sprouts. The chicken was dry and chewy. I just don't get the draw."
2,"Chef cooking in the open facility. Mostly noodles. Pad Thai noodles, beef. A most desirable appetite for the hungry man. Couldn't take this to heart."
4,"Great service, great selection! My husband and I both got bikes here, we could've got them somewhere else, but the people here were so nice, that we came back and had them order the bikes for us. Plus they gave us a discount since we bought two bikes. They built my bike in just a couple hours for me, and I LOVE IT! So glad we found this place on yelp!"
4,"Came in to get my a Fossil watch repaired that belonged to my uncle.  The store owner/watchmaker was very friendly and let me in even though it was 5 minutes to closing time. He took one look at my watch, saw that it was ill-fitting, and proceeded to work his magic. We made pleasant conversation for about fifteen minutes as he adjusted, shined, and set my watch to the proper time. And the best part - he only charged me $5! I offered him $10 for being so thorough and for staying open last his posted hours but he wouldn't accept it. Don't let the pawn shop style sketchness fool you - this is one hole-in-the-wall worth visiting."
4,"Replaced my watch battery and fixed the inside of another watch for $5 a piece. Super cheap considering the ones in the mall quoted me like $25+ to replace one battery. I was so impressed at how quick & nice the gentlemen was who works there.  He even added a diamond stud that had fallen out for free, so sweet."
0,"Pros: Consistent quality. I like the pepperoni pizzone and my sister likes the Hershey chocolate sticks. \n\nCons: Why would I bother to place my order online hours in advance, if its not going to be ready when I arrive? They didn't even start making it till I got here. Additionally, they got my order wrong! Scary neighborhood and parking lot full. I had to park in the shopping complex next to this one."
4,"I buy all of my tires at Discount Tire and my recent experience here just reminded me why. I noticed on Saturday morning that I had a nail stuck in the sidewall of my tire and decided that before waking up on Monday morning with a flat I'd better get it taken care of right away. Because the nail was in the sidewall, the tire had to be replaced, not repaired. However, because I always purchase the replacement certificates with my tires, it only cost me $20 for a brand new Pirelli tire. As always at Discount Tire, service was outstanding and my tire was done and car ready within 45 minutes. \n\nDiscount Tire, I am a lifelong customer!"
3,Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.
4,"The food at Little Shanghai is plentiful and reasonably priced.  The architecture and ambiance is a little dated but still has a high level of authenticity that is fitting and functional.  I haven't been to a better chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  The house chicken is to crave for late at night in your  refrigerator.  The sizzling beef should be a little more dangerous, kind of didn't sizzle the way my imagination played out.  The bar even works functionally and has some character.  Highly recommend if your are in the Arcadia area."
2,Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!
1,"The shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken were good, but the rest of our order left a lot to be desired.  The crab puffs were missing a key ingredient....the crab!!!  That was really disappointing.  The beef and broccoli and cashew chicken didn't score high marks with our group.  Not sure we will give them another try."
3,"The only place I'll ever go when I need a seasonal faux tan. \n\nMy visits typically take 45 minutes--15 to tan, 30 to chew the fat with Sandy. The Proprietors here are so awesome you won't care that the beds are a little older or that there's dust on the self-tune radio. As for the pricing, I highly doubt anybody else in the Arcadia area can compete. (I think you can get two weeks of unlimited tanning for some absurdly low price of like $30)\n\nI've never used their spray tanning but I've heard nothing but good reviews. \n\nAs mentioned in earlier reviews, Camelback Tanning is located next to Thai Lana, arguably CenPho's greatest Thai restaurant. So next time you're in the 38th St/Indian School area stop and see Sandy at Camelback Tanning, and then head two doors down for some of the best Pad Thai you'll ever eat."
1,"Not terrible food, but not good either.  I'd never go back because good food is very easy to come by out here.  \n\nI had the Sukiyaki beef bowl.  It was beef, cabbage, and onion over rice.  There was a sauce used, but it might have just been soy sauce.  I got salt and umami out of it.  It was pretty much just overcooked beef and veggies over bad rice that was very salty.  It was $7.XX, but I should have gotten a hamburger at Wendy's or a salad at Safeway, because that would have been better.  \n\nI dislike it when reviewers waste my time talking about decor, but holy straight out of the 1990's!  Really dim, none of the signs are on, and the wall menu was one of those big black panels with yellow lettering that was backlit.  It really set the stage for the D- food.  It felt like walking into a Bradley's or Caldoor in 1993.\n\nI don't want to give 1 star, because 1 star places really did something to deserve it.  This place was just extremely underwhelming."
4,"Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious.\n\nWatch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles."
3,"Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe - hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale.\n\nI was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows-up. I hope this place survives."
4,The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!
1,"Over rated and over priced. \n\nI've been here a number of times and never been impressed with any of the specials or their homemade pastas either. Every time I left however, I was reminded of how expensive it is, especially if you go with chef and waiter recommendations.  We also have a hard time understanding why the owner/chef will not make guest request changes to any of the entrees.  For example, if someone wants a different sauce with their pasta or their entree prepared a certain way, why would the owner refuse to do so ?  I've seen this happen twice at this restaurant and both time guests have been put in unpleasant positions while ruining their dining experience.    Its too bad that there are not that many great italian restaurants in the Phoenix - Scottsdale area, and Marcellino's falls into that category as well."
3,"Went to Marcellino with a large dinging group (about 18 people).  We were seated promptly even though we didn't have a reservation.  Our waiter was very good about keeping all of our orders separate, and he was even able to prepare separate checks for each person in the party.  Excellent service.\nRestaurant was very dark, but from what I could see seemed to be nicely decorated.  It was not too noisy.  I had the Strozzaprete ai Broccoli di Rape.  The pasta was supposed to be two colors, but I had trouble seeing it in the dim dining room.  Although I couldn't see my food, I could taste it, and it did taste delicious!  The noodles were perfectly cooked and nicely chewy.  However, $22.95 seemed like a LOT of money for a bowl of pasta."
2,"I ate at Tutti Santi while in Phoenix for a business conference.  Met up with a co-workers father-in-law who happened to be in town and he suggested Tutti Santi, which he had visited on previous trips.  Had it not been for that recommendation, I don't know that I ever would have found this place.\n\nThey were quite busy that night due to a special promotion and it seemed that they were not quite used to it.  It took quite some time to place our order.  We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and I ordered a salad and gnocchi.  We started sipping the wine while waiting for our appetizers.  The salad was decent and the bread they brought for the table was actually very good.  However, due to the slow service, our wine bottle was empty long before the food came.\n\nWhen the food arrived, we ordered another bottle of wine and began eating.  The gnocchi was very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well. Unfortunately, our second bottle of wine never arrived.  When we mentioned it, the waiter apologized, but that was it.\n\nThis would have been an easy four star review but the sub-par service killed it for me. They may have been busy, but 15 minutes for drinks and 30 minutes for salads is still pushing it."
1,"Food ranges from delicious (elegant and lovely beef carpaccio) to mediocre (bland chicken rollatini and what might as well have been frozen vegetables).  The servers are lovely and attentive, and sort of distract you from the distinctly geriatric feel in the place.  My husband and I felt like the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 40 years.  I have no idea where this best ravioli nomination came from - they are abysmally forgettable.  I am hard-pressed to believe that a better ravioli cannot be found in Phoenix - there are just way too many good culinary adventures in the area to consider these bland, oversauced pillows of flavorless ricotta worth ordering.  \n\nUnimpressed by everything, we were bowled over by the bill.  How could a meal so forgettable come out to $150 for the two of us?  Was the wine that expensive? No.  Did we order anything extraordinary? No. Are we going back? You already know the answer..."
4,"It's simple............. I don't believe I've given 5-stars to an Italian restaurant since Yelping, until now! I can only hope that if you're in Phoenix, and you try any of their locations, your meal will be as great as our's.\n\nAnd for us, the revelation of why this meal was sooo good, went back to the source; fresh ingredients. And how do we know that Tutti Santi cooks with fresh ingredients, like fresh picked basil from their own garden? Because Nina, the 80 year \""young\"" owner shared that, and a few other secrets with us, at our table.  \n\nIt might have been the comment that the gnocchi was absolutely as good as my wife's....... and THAT COMMENT was made in front of my wife! The word must've gone from our lips, to the server, to the kitchen......... to Nina herself! Because from then on, it was more than just a great Italian dinner experience. It was a great Italian dinner experience with \""Nina.\"" She left the kitchen, and came to our table, sharing some cooking, and life, experiences, and also sharing how she comes into the restaurant as early as 4am, just to make their fresh pastas..... and that great gnocchi. I couldn't believe her energy and spunk! Waiter........ I'm having whatever Nina's having for breakfast!!!\n\nAnd yes, we started by ordering their \""famous gnocchi appetizer.\"" You've got to order the gnocchi; either the appetizer or the entree! Enough said on that. We then followed with one of the specials; Penne pasta with chicken and Italian sausage in a pink sauce. It was DELICIOUS... and I could taste the very traditional Italian sausage, which was perfectly seasoned. And the chicken? It was white meat strips that had an incredibly fresh taste, and wonderful texture. Our other dish was their eggplant parm. And just how good was that? My wife commented that it melted in her mouth; the best version of eggplant parm she's ever had. And it came with a very generous serving of spaghetti pomadoro. The pomodoro is a basic red sauce, and in this case, a very \""Roma tomato\"" fresh tasting sauce. And because I asked about their meat sauces, the waiter brought me a soup bowl filled with the Bolognese sauce, which I liberally put on both their garlic bread and some of my penne pasta. That could've been a meal in itself. \n\nNina's kitchens prove the adage that, \""...there's no substitute for quality and freshness!\"" And she also proved that her affection for great food extends to her affection for her patrons, as she brought us a huge serving of her \""in-house\"" tiramisu. It was such a well balanced dessert; \""almost as sweet as Nina!\"" Enough said."
3,"I live nowhere near here (thank God!) but have had their donuts from co-workers bringing them in and have been in store. I recently tried the Texas kolache, which is a breaded sausage and cheese pastry. You can get it spicy or not, I chose for the not spicy warmed up. It was delicious! As far as donuts, their glazed is addicting. I also got an iced chai, which was very flavorful and delicious. Restaurant inside has bar seating and a few tables. Staff is also really friendly. Overall winner here!!"
1,"I was really irritated with this place.  I called up prior to heading over for a problem with my wife to check on ER wait times.  The woman on the phone was extermely rude.  She told me she could not give me that kind of information.  When I followed up with 'Is there alot of people waiting?' I received the same answer, just with more attitude.  \n\nI followed up with an additional question about insurance.  After being transfered to admissions or billing (?), someone who should know, asking the question again, a non-answer was for some reason rudely given. \""We bill all insurances\"".  OK, thats great, are you an in-network provider for my insurance?  \""I can't answer that question!\"" ...CLICK!  She hung up on me!\n\nI would give it less stars, but I really don't know how the medical staff actually is.  Support staff needs wrk!"
1,"It's better than nothing. \n\nIf you work in the area (16th and Morton) and have a limited amount of time for lunch, or if you didn't have time to eat breakfast in the morning the Veranda Bistro is for you. You will be completely not-excited-but-not-disappointed by this exactly as expected food. \n\nThe breakfast menu is essentially 4 ingredients (egg, meat, cheese, starch) served in several varieties. They all pretty much taste the same. One warning, the home fries are typically undercooked. The eggs have an amazing characteristic, that being the ability to crumble into a pile of bits too tiny to be picked up with a fork. I sense some breakfast fairy magic at play. \n\nLunchtime is a bit better, with several sandwich options, both cold and hot. There are salads and soup, and a variety of deep fried snacks. I've eaten a few of the cold sandwiches, and they are moderately tasty. The salads are premade and sitting in a cooler, which makes for some drippy lettuce. \n\nSpeaking of lettuce, I would love to meet the monster that's strong enough to cram THAT MUCH lettuce into one container. I'm not exaggerating when I say I pulled off enough lettuce to make two more salads of equal size. No one in this world needs that much lettuce in one sitting. \n\nVeranda Bistro serves a valuable purpose and is blessed with a great location. It's the only restaurant within walking distance for a few thousand people. I only wish that they tried a little harder rather than delivering exactly what I expected. Curse my low expectations!"
0,"It was my boyfriends birthday and we were trying to find a new pizza place worthy of us not going to oreganos anymore. And after reading all these reviews, Im wondering if I just went on a bad night? But good restaurants shouldnt have \""bad nights\"" right? Aside from the friendly service over the phone, nothing was worth going back for. My bf is a huge ricotta fan so I decided to order the ny white pizza and some garlic bread. The gentleman over the phone told me 25min and I showed up in 20. Everything was ready and I walked in and out within one minute. I shouldve known instantly that something wasnt right. One thing i love about oreganos is that they show you the pizza before you walk out. When i got in the car and looked at the pizza, the cheese was already crusted solid on top, showing that it had been sitting under a heater for maybe 10min or so. By the time I got home (a few blocks away), my pizza was room temperture, the cheese on top was rock hard and i couldnt taste ANYTHING but GARLIC GARLIC GARLIC. Super disappointing. Back to Oregano's we go...."
1,"I have had this in my \""to try\"" list for a long time... not really long enough :(\n\nI stopped in for a lunch special...2 slices and a drink for like $4.00 or so... BUT they only accept debit over $5.00 Then make the damn special $5 bucks! I had to add a third slice just so I could eat there. LAME\n\nThe pizza was thin, no sauce and topped nice with cheese. The entire thing was flavorless. NONE not the sauce or the crust. \n\nThe service was all over the place (not in a good way) the building was roasting hot, and there was an old guy with his Pee Bag hanging out there while eating. (no stars deducted for that)\n\nOver all... I doubt I would be back."
0,"I hadn't tried Pat's in a while so my boyfriend and I decided to order it this last Saturday night. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was missing!! It just tasted like dough. My boyfriend couldn't even finish it and he is not a picky eater. We will never try Pat's again, especially for the price. I recommend Stumpy's or NYPD. What a waste of money!"
0,"My wife went into to pick up some chemicals that our pool need and was mistreated and harassed because she had the nerve to pay with a debit card for a very small purchase.  Are you kidding me? I have spent hundreds of dollars at this store.\n\nI understand the costs businesses incur when running things as debit/credit, apparently B&L doesn't understand the cost they incur when mistreating customers.\n\nDo yourself a favor and and go to Perry's Pool and Pump.  They knowledgeable as well and will treat you with a bit more respect.  I am not willing to give my business to any store that mistreats their customers.\n\n*Update*\nThe reason why debit was an issue was because it was such a small amount, not because it was a debit card.  Stores pay a transaction fee and the fee was going to essentially cancel the actual payment made.  My wife and I generally don't carry cash on us.  The money a business would lose in this situation is more than offset by the purchases of mass chlorine, acid, and salt for our pool.\n\n*Important Update*\nMike from B&L contacted me to try and set things straight and get to the bottom of what happened.  That is a great indicator that they are trying to improve upon the customer service and are at least aware that in an age of social media, service needs to be top of mind for any business.  \n\nThat being said, I have no interest in going back.  Once you mistreat my wife, it is game over.  I hope others have a better experience."
4,I have been to Mary for facials seeking clear skin for 9 years.  Yes my skin looks great.  She always has the latest and best products and treatments.  Mary 's salon is always a place of welcome and relaxation.  She takes time to evaluate my skin each session.
1,"I'm torn. They have great deals at times, like buy 1 get 2 free packages of boneless skinless chicken breasts. But they also have crappy bread and produce, last time I went there the strawberries I bought that looked fine rotted within a day, the tortillas all stuck together and the bread went moldy. I didn't save my receipt because I have never had to return anything to a grocery store before.. I guess I will limit my shopping to frozen foods or smoking deals."
0,No matter how many times they call (nearly every day for the last few months!) and no matter how many times I tell them I am not interested and to please STOP CALLING - they continue to harass - calls come in from 8am until 9pm.  Based on these business practices alone I will never use them.
0,"If your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food , this is not the place for you. I had a green chili burro with rice and beans, it had to be one of the most bland meals I have ever had, this the place for those out of towners, You know the ones from those cold states, who are not familiar with what Mexican food should taste like. I have to say it is edible, you probably won't die, BUT DEFINATELY NOT ENJOYABLE, TASTEFUL, FLAVORFUL, OR MEMORABLE.\n This is not the place for true mexican food connoisseur. \n As for  the service it was average, not anything special."
2,"Oh my, dare I...yes, I'm going to have to go with 3 stars.  Normally I would shun, poo-poo, and dismiss a gringo-Mex place like Carlos O'Brien's, but I got thinking that for what it is (gringo-Mex)... it's pretty darn OK!  Last night's meal of grilled shrimp and vegetables clinched it. The tacos are pretty good, the chimis, the burritos...and to find a decent, light ,healthy option too (I gotta go healthy once and a while, just not too often), well that's special."
2,"I come to Carlos O'Briens periodically - maybe annually, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's a good restaurant. The food is good (not incredible, but a solid good) with large portions (I never finishe a meal). Very American style rather than traditional food with the typical dishes - tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc. They go heavy on the cheese - it doesn't bother me, but it has bothered folks I have gone with. Otherwise, it is good food I am glad to eat.\n  The service was incredibly fast. Tonight, a Friday evening, they were packed, yet we ordered, ate and chatted, and were out the door in less than 40 minutes. Staffers were there whenever my glass was low, but weren't in our faces all the time.\n  The prices are medium - you're looking at $10-20 per person depending on what you order.\n   The restaurant itself is pretty decent. The decor is pretty American Mexi-style, with obligatory bright colors and wood furniture. It's not a quiet place, but it isn't real loud - just active.\n  Short story is, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but am perfectly happy to stop in."
1,I went there recently and in the past it used to be my go to place. Sadly the food is not what it used to be and I no longer crave their chimichangas anymore. As for the Drinks yes these Margaritas are one of the best might just go for happy hour for now on.
1,"Was my 1st time at Carlos O'Brien's, it was a friends 40th birthday dinner and this is her favorite place to go. I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.\n\nI arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party! \n\nLet's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it.\n \nI went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.\n\nNow like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here."
1,My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. \nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.
1,here for happy hour on the patio 1st strike was the lipstick on my draft beer glass. 2nd was the the very rude server who treated our group like we came to dine and dash... the good points the chicken fundio and them accommodating my friends lap dog on their patio. good food bad service. yo Pancho stop being an ass no tip for you buddy.
3,"Great pizza it is; Chicago-style it is NOT.  Seems strange to me that Chicagoans claim this as \""Chicago Style\"" pizza.  Oh well - moving on.\n\nTheir sausage is some of the best I've had outside of Chicago - without question.  The pizza is great - topping selection is great - the crust is good and I love their sweet marinara.  The service is sometimes lacking... it can be slow and inattentive."
0,I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again.
4,"I love this place! I've been eating pizza from Spinato's for about five years now! And I've been to them all (this one, scottsdale, tempe, glendale -- except I don't frequent Ahwatukee, so I haven't been there yet) - they're all great!\n\nThe sauce is what sets it apart from other places. Also, I usually don't like pizza that is cut into square/rectangular shapes (weird, i know) but with their pizza, that's not a factor.\n\nYou can't go wrong with whatever you order. Perfect for dining in or take out!"
3,"We were originally driving out to Glendale to find another pizza place, but we didn't check to see if they were open.  Alas, we were pizza less and starving at 1:00pm on a Sunday.  We found this place on Yelp! and decided to venture out.  \n\nIt's a strip mall next to a Mathnasium, but when you walk it in it's pretty cozy.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  She was honest about the pizza portion sizes, so that we could make better decisions about our order, so we decided on the Spaghetti Calzone for an appetizer and a small thick crust pepperoni pizza.\n\nNow, let me start with saying they claim to be a Chicago style pizzeria, but when I think Chicago I think deep dish.  I would assume that they are referring to their thin crust, but deep dish reigns supreme in the Windy City.   Their thick crust pizza is Sicilian style, and I'd have to say I was a little disappointed.  I wasn't expecting the bread or the sauce to be so sweet.  I honestly think if the sauce were a little tangier, it would offset the sweeter crust.  \n\nMy favorite part was the Spaghetti Calzone appetizer.  I am going to recommend that you get the marinara covered, spaghetti and mozzarella packed goodness.  I would honestly go to the one closer to my house just for the calzone."
2,"A great place to find utilitarian beauty items - need a cuticle clipper? specialty hair dyes? nail buffers? Designed for beauty professionals, Sally's doesn't carry many \""name' brand items you'll see at a place like Ulta - no Bedhead or Paul Mitchel or Garnier or OPI ... but lots of bulk products that I see in my neighborhood nail salon. I go for the things like cuticle clippers and nail buffers - good deals and good selections on items if you don't care about the brand. I recently picked up some nail basecoat and topcoat - the same kind my favorite salon uses, and cheaper than OPI at Ulta, etc."
1,The store is supposed to open at 9am and the lady in the store seemed crabby and put out that she had to unlock the door at 9:05. She walked over flipped the lock and walked away in a huff. I was there for 15 minutes and she didn't even say hello!
4,"I have been going here for the past 10 years after getting one too many Great Clip haircuts. I haven't had a bad haircut since I've been going here. A vast majority of the people that work here are mainstays, so you get consistency here. Kathy and Peggy are great people and will treat you right. \n\nThe place is always clean and the extra touches are well worth the money. The midway feature is worth the price alone not to mention added assurance that you're getting a quality haircut. I've read a few negative reviews about wait times. I'd rather wait a few extra minutes to get a quality haircut rather than getting in 5 minutes earlier and get butchered by someone who just got their license. \n\nThis place is very well run and I like the people complaining about business practices. Listen they've been there 10 years, I think they're doing something right. Take it from someone who's been going to both Athleticuts for the past 10 years. This place is outstanding."
2,"If eating in a filthy daycare center is your idea of a great dining experience, this is a must try place for you!  We stopped in for brunch last Saturday when we were feeling in an adventurous mood and looking to deviate from our tried and true brunch spots.  It was a beautiful day so we asked to be seated outside and as the hostess lead us to our table, it became apparent that there was NOWHERE on the patio and perhaps the entire restaurant that would offer us any solace from the excessive number of running, screaming, sticky fingered children who had apparently consumed too much sugar at the chocolate fountain.\n\nNow, I understand that when sitting outside in the Phoenix area, tables and chairs aren't always spotless due to the dust factor, but one would have expected that our plastic tablecloth would have at least been wiped down sufficiently to remove the layers of food that had accumulated over what I'm guessing was at least the past few months.  After a significant wait, a server (not ours) showed up with some water that was served in glasses designed to hold enough liquid to quench a toddler's thirst (although, given the number of toddlers present, perhaps this was intentional) and some chips, salsa, and hot sauce.  The chips were of both the flour and corn tortilla varieties and were rather heavy on the grease.  The salsa was so mild, the only real flavor that it had was that of the sliced black olives in it, which is not necessarily a quality one seeks in a salsa.  The \""hot\"" sauce was actually just as mild as the salsa and was served in a glass bottle that was so filthy and had so much food stuck to the outside of it that my hands were actually sticky from touching it.  At long last, our waiter finally showed up to take our drink order: a mimosa for me and a bloody mary for my husband.  After another ten minutes, he finally reappeared with the drinks and had I not been quick to cover my white shorts with my napkin, we would have been heading home for me to change since he'd spilled the bloody mary while carrying it and cluelessly reached across me with it to set the drink in front of my husband, causing a stream of spilled tomato juice to run down the plastic tablecloth and onto my legs.\n\nThe only redeeming factor that pulled this place up to three stars was actually the food.  I ordered a two item combo with a cheese enchilada and a bean & guacamole tostada and when the food finally arrived, it was clear a one item combo would have been more than enough as both items were huge.  All of the tostada ingredients were fresh and tasty and the cheese enchilada was flavorful too.  My husband had the huevos rancheros which he also thought were quite good.  This place is definitely a good value for the price as it's very inexpensive, but having heard that they actually host wedding receptions here, I would have expected a lot more in terms of the atmosphere and service.  It's a place that we won't hurry back to, but won't cross off the list as I've definitely had far worse food and overall dining experiences at other Mexican restaurants in the Valley."
2,"Really liked the food. The fiancee's sis got some sort of veggie fajitas...I'll DEF get that the next time I go back. Not much else to say, it was a mexican restaurant. They are so numerous in Phoenix, it's hard to be super impressed. I'd definitely go back though. Everything on the menu looked tasty!"
3,"Karen did the flowers, center pieces, chair rentals, and sashes for my wedding.  We actually paid for fake flowers for our centerpieces and Karen ended up receiving extra of the flowers for my bouquets and she ended up making all my centerpieces out of those extra flowers at no additonal charge.  Karen was super easy to work and very affordable. Her staff showed up exactly on time for delivery too. Overall great experience"
2,"The tellers are really nice and helpful and there's rarely that long of a wait.  The thing that I have noticed specifically about this one is that when I want to make a cash deposit at their ATM's, it is not able to go forward with the transaction.  Now this has happened at least 3 different times.  I have large amounts of cash that I would like to deposit, but it won't let me and it's not like I leave home just to run to the bank and come back.  I make my first stop at the bank and then continue the rest of my errands, which I don't feel comfortable carrying a lot of cash on me.  Sometimes, I'm on my way to the gym and I have to leave the cash in the car (it's hidden and there's an alarm, but it's still nothing I feel comfortable doing)."
0,You get what you pay for. I may as well have let my kids paint my toenails. Not to mention the tech was rough and cut/pinched several of my toes during my pedicure.   Not impressed. I definitely won't be back.
2,"I have been taking my friend who is 91, with Alzheimers,  to this nail salon for years.  It's larger than it looks from the outside.  I don't think they are as sophisticated as some but  that's ok.  What I do appreciate is the way they take the time to continue making it a good experience for my friend.  Maybe I tip them to much.  As long as they continue the service, I will pay."
1,"I was here randomly with my step-uncle one day.  It's a low key place with some interesting folks.  Mostly of the 40+ age group.  Drinks are cheap.  As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting.  Although, I also heard the pizza is good."
1,"Had Dad's catering at a Christmas party I attended and even for free food I felt ripped off. I would have brought a lunch that day if I knew that I would be eating canned green beans, undercooked scalloped potatoes and cheap packaged rolls with \""whipped spread\"". The little desert trays were good at least, and the staff was friendly enough, which is why I bumped it up to two stars."
1,Stayed at the hotel for 4 days. We ate breakfast here everyday and one dinner. The dinner left a lot to be desired. I ordered filet medium and it came out all red not medium. Waitress blamed it on st. Pats day specials. My daughter ordered a pasta and vegetable dish being vegan with oil on the side. It came all mixed together not on side.  \n\nShort order cook who does all eggs was fantastic! My wie ordered eggs benedict from kitchen rather tan wait in line for cooked to order.  They were just warm. This place needs to do a better job!
2,"While the staff was excellent, the food and beverages were highly average. We had wings, tomato & mozzarella, burger and salads. The wings had a pomegranate BBQ sauce, which was good. The bill came to $24. I think the Hilton Tapatio staff are exceptional, but the food here lacks imagination. Not overly memorable."
0,"We stayed at the Pointe Hotel on a stacation and tried unsuccessfully to get reservations at A Different Point of View, so ended up here.\nWhat a disappointment. I had the Trout and, my mistake, asked for it to be saut\u00e9ed, it was overlooked and tasted of butter. The potatoes and all the other veggies that came with it were so buttered that this was all you could taste. Head Office had the Salmon which she said was fine.\nThe reason we had fish was because there was absolutely nothing on the menu that was Veggie, though our overthetop waiter did offer to make something up from another dish. Overall, a bad experience and I had been there before many years ago and also to the one at the South Mountain point and was not disappointed."
1,"I went here after a late flight from Denver, as it was the only restaurant at our hotel that was really open, and we did not want snacky food. Let's just say the food was definitely lacking. I ordered a burger and it pretty much tasted like a hockey puck it was so burnt. Maybe try it Medium instead of Medium well next time? Scratch that I probably wont be going back next time I am in Phoenix, The service was OK but I have experienced better. I would not recommend this place, but if it is the absolute only place and someone else was paying I would not pass it up."
4,"beautiful setting with a great view and great atmosphere. definitely high end and maybe a little overpriced, but it's worth it every now and then, even with the ocassional snooty people around.\n\nwe've been lots of times, and i have never been disappointed by the food. service has been slow on occassion and not always friendly, but never rude or lacking. \n\nthe filet mignon is fantastic! (well, was.. it's been a while since i was here last). the chicken dishes are kind of boring and my mom's had stomach upsets a few times, but she's ridiculously sensitive, and otherwise, this is a really nice place"
1,My boyfriend and I went out on a thursday night for a last valentines day celebration at DPOV. Everything started off nice and were really enjoying the view and each other... The place started getting busier and our team of servers began stopping by less and less... By the time we had gotten our entrees they were pretty much nonexistent. Our food was just above Luke warm and our wine was empty.... After about 30 mins of waiting for some one to come over one of our servers came by to clear our plates. He didn't ask how our food was and didn't offer any dessert menus. We aren't really the complaining type but considering the price of the food my boyfriend got up to discuss our issues with the manager whom removed the entrees. This place really needs to improve their customer service skills. We decided to go to one of our favorite places for dessert. The  Rokerij. We won't return or recommend this place.
4,"Yet another Fantastic YELP ELITE EVENT....WOHOOO....let me spell it out for you:\n\nF.....for Fabulous Food\nA.....for Awesome Atmosphere\nN....for Nostalgic Nightlife\nT.....for Tantalizing Tidbits\nA....for Awesome Ambience\nS....for Superb Service\nT....for Tempting Treasures\nI.....for Invigorating \nC.....for Complementary Cuisine\n\nYes at A Different Pointe of View Restaurant all of the above can certainly be enjoyed however it's true value is the VIEW of the Valley of the Sun.....it is unmatched. The manager said if we could find a better view in Arizona....please let him know....well I don't know about the Entire state of Arizona....but as for the Valley maybe the view from the Wrigley mansion would come close.....but it can't touch the AWESOME VIEWS you can witness at A Different Pointe of View. Don't take my word for it....just try it for yourself and I think you will see things from a Different Pointe of View as well. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
4,"This restaurant is 5 stars for the view alone (which is what everyone else has mentioned), but the food and service are excellent too. The other night my girlfriend and I went back for the first time since the amazing Yelp event earlier in the year. We started the night off with a drink at sunset on the outdoor patio, overlooking most of Phoenix. Then we headed inside for our dinner and the manager greeted us with a \""Thank you for coming back to Different Pointe of View,\"" which I thought was a nice touch. I assume he knew we were returning since I mentioned we had a card for a free bottle of sparkling wine when I made the reservations weeks before. \n\nWe were seated inside near the window and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our bottle of Champagne was presented to us to start the night and we placed our food orders. We decided to split the Braised Duck Ravioli ($12) and the Pan Seared Diver Scallops ($15). There were two raviolis and two scallops per order and we felt both dishes great choices. The scallops were some of the best I have ever had. \n\nFor our main course we each ordered the Grilled Cedar River Filet Mignon ($38). The perfectly prepared tenderloin steak was accompanied with horseradish crust, Swiss chard, roasted fingerling potatoes, smoked apple wood bacon, chives, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche and port wine pomegranate reduction. No I didn't memorize all of that, of course I retyped it from the menu.\n\nFor dessert we split the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Brulee (all desserts $9). It was delicious, but rather small and didn't quite satisfy my sweet tooth. The buttercream blue cheese cookie and fresh strawberries were a nice addition, but even with those it was too small a dish. \n\nOverall, I 100% recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at Different Pointe of View. It has been one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants for many years. It's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike. My only recommendations for improvements would be to add a server or two to the outside patio bar area since it tends to be slow on busy evenings. Also, I think the names for some of their dishes are a bit much and could be shortened."
1,"For a restaurant that supposedly prides itself on its five star service I was very disappointed. First off the waitress looked completely disheveled, messy hair too small faded black shirt and cheap looking black pants. Then when we placed out order for the mussels we were advised by her that they are very fishy this time of year. My husband had never tried them so we took a chance. We also ordered the Kobe beef sliders and the tomato salad. The Kobe sliders were so well done you could call them burnt, the salad was tiny with wilted lettuce and the mussels(surprisingly) were good. By the time we saw our waitress again we were finished with our meal. I asked her about the Kobe sliders and commented that they are always prepared well done and she quickly brushed off my comment and walked off.So much for the customer is always right. Needless to say my husband and I were very disappointed to spend a hefty amount of money for so-so food and terrible service. Needless to say we will not go to Different Pointe of View again and will NOT recommend it to our family and friends."
4,"WOW! my girlfriend and I ate here on Valentines weekend and we were blown away. \nWe were greeted and sat down promptly (before our reservation time... we were about 10 min early).  Not only was their staff very hospitable but we greatly enjoyed our meal, and of course, the view.  \nThis restaurant on the mountain oversees Phoenix and could not be a more beautiful location for dinner. \nOur meals were fantastic. I enjoyed the tasting menu, and she tried the steak and lobster, which was amazing.\nAfter our meal, we spent some time on the patio, which is well equipped with seats, fire places, and heaters. \nOverall, a wonderful evening with my Love and an excellent dining experience."
1,"Dined on Friday, 2/22/13. My wife and I recently moved to the Phoenix area from Chicago and I really had no idea about where to dine. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to dine at least at a 4 star restaurant- so I came to Yelp for advice.\n\nOur reservation was 8:15pm and we arrived at 7:55pm. We were invited to sit in the lounge area, which we did, and I expected to do so since we were so early.  We sat in the lounge for about 10 mins and were not approached by a server. In fact, I thought there were no servers since I saw none on the floor so I went to the bar and ordered myself, just like I would at a Chicago neighborhood bar. (Irk#1)Drinks were good and strong, but REALLY pricey- $26 for 2 drinks.\n\nAround 8:30pm, we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reservation yet, (they said they would find us in the lounge). We were told our table still wasn't ready and to wait by the fireplace. I was a little peeved now and Iwould have expected to wait if I was late- but we were sufficiently on time I thought. \n\nWe were seated after waiting another 5 mins or so. (8:45pm-30 mins late)(Irk#2) The wait staff, I thought, were pretty good overall. They did a lot of table \""hopping\"", i.e. covered each other's tables, so diners were well taken care of yet not too pushy or chatty.\n\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque soup. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered the scallops. Bread was not brought to the table until after we ordered dinner- which was 10 mins after we were seated. (irk #3) The sourdough bread was excellent. The focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry. There were 3 dipping sides offered with the bread, which were very good. \n\nLobster bisque was quite delicious. They put this \""hydroponically infused\"" basil seasoning on top of the soup that was very good. I thought the soup was a little overcooked (sitting in the pot too long taste) but still good. My dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked. (pan-fried). I asked for 2 more pieces of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were \""out\"" of sourdough. (irk#4). Friday night dinner service and out of bread? Really? My wife's scallops were cool as well as her vegetable sides on the plate. (irk #5)The waiter didn't check on us until 10 mins after the dinner was serves (irk#6) so it wasn't feasible to send it back to get reheated. The waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble, at least.\n\nThe last irk (#7) was that we asked for a bag to put our left-over take home boxes in- 3 total boxes. The waiter said they \""were out of bags\"". He checked twice and the 3rd time brought us a Home Depot bag. I asked if he went to his car to get it. How difficult would it have been for the restaurant manager to go down to the gift shop and grab a couple of dozen bags? \n\nMaybe my expectations are too high since I'm from Chicago(?), but when  a restaurant is rated 5 stars by all of you Yelpers, I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."
4,"Dined here on 3/23 with a friend. We had reservations for 730 and quickly realized we should go earlier because we wanted to see the view with some light. So, we went to the Terrace for drinks/apps which is just one floor below and has the same identical App menu. We sat on the patio there & had a great time. We went upstairs for our dinner at 0730. I had the salad with blood orange vinagraitte which was delicious and then I had the filet and my friend had the hanger steak. My steak was delicious. It came with something weird on the side that I didn't care for, but I had enough with everything else I had eaten. My friend loved her hanger steak and it came with some sort of mushroom risoto deliciousness. We ended by splitting the apple dessert and it was great. Our waiter, Bob seemed a little aloof and annoyed when we asked questions about the menu items/wine list. Since it was packed on a Saturday, I wonder if they are pressured to get people in & out? Not really sure. He did a great job of bringing our food out in a timely manner & keeping drinks filled. My meal with a salad, filet, and a glass of wine & half the dessert cost was 70$ I honestly don't think that is that expensive as some others have reported. $70 for a nice, upscale dinner is pretty much expected. This place is beautiful with great views and great food. Would definitely return."
4,"Dined here for my Birthday. Had the lobster ravioli dish it was amazing. I also had a birthday dessert; a decadent chocolate cake that was beautifully presented. It is, definitely, a great spot if you want to make someone feel extra special. \nThe view on it's own is exceptional. \nPerfect spot for a romantic night."
2,"View was nice. Dim romantic setting. Food didn't even really taste all that good for it to be that expensive, but i'm assuming they're charging for the \""experience\"". I got the Chicken and risotto. Babe got the scallops & said they were good. We both tried the lobster bisque and it was extremely rich, i must say. They also had a great wine selection. Try the plum wine. its the only one they have, i forgot the name lol I probably wouldn't take my business here because im more about the taste of the food besides a view, but it was a very nice, romantic setting. I enjoyed myself."
0,"Store manager Clinton does not represent Michael Bollig's vision of friendly or professional as stated on the website. Clinton was extremely rude, disrespectful, and accusatory. While arranging the delivery of my dryer we encountered a miscommunication and the coordination of delivering my dryer became complicated. Instead of Clinton taking responsibility for the miscommunication he made every excuse in the book and tried to pass the blame onto me. As I tried to explain the situation he talked over me, raised his voice and was very condescending. I expressed my dissatisfaction with his lack of customer service; however he did not seem to care. On the other hand, the delivery driver was very nice and accommodating. He waited over an hour for me to get home to make up for the miscommunication. I appreciated that greatly and displayed my gratitude with a tip. I was disappointed to notice a ding on my wall from the installation of my dryer after he left. I guarantee Clinton has cost B&B Appliances a lot of money by his lack of customer regard and therefore loss of future business. He could definitely benefit from some coaching regarding customer service and professionalism. I never post on yelp, but here I am 9 hours later still astonished by the worst customer service I have EVER encountered. \n\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130604134550-284615-15-statistics-that-should-change-the-business-world-but-haven-t"
1,"This was my first time at Wendy's, my best friend had been going here forever so I assumed it wouldn't be too bad. \n\nTo start we were instantly greeted and the place looked clean. Unfortunately there was mostly dark colors of polish to choose from which was a huge bummer. My friend got her nails started and I sat next to her waiting for someone to become available to do mine, mind you I was the only one waiting. A few minutes later two ladies walked in and were taken care of before myself when the other technicians were finished, I let it slide. After 20 minutes went by, Wendy (the owner) arrived and started my full set. She was rough and rushed the whole time. Meanwhile another customer came in, she waited, but was obviously impatient. She offered to come back, but Wendy rushed through my nails, which are uneven and have gunk underneath them. She told me to wait aside as she give this lady a fill and polish change. So I waited for her to complete the other lady while I waited to get my polish. She rushed painting the polish, as well as making a mess around my fingers. I'm only content with my nails, and I will not be going back."
0,"Ready for the creepiest customer service story ever?????\n\nThe other day I had a not so great gel polish job there; kind of sloppy around the edges, a few little bumps and bubbles, etc. My tech clearly could not understand much English. The rate had been agreed when I came in: $20. When I went to pay at the front,  I said to the owner, Wendy, that I was not thrilled with how it looked, but I had to leave for school pickup. She said,   \""OK, five dollar off.\"" So I handed over $15.  She said, rudely, \""No! You owe twenty! Extra for taking off your old polish!\"" I said that no, we had agreed on the price when I arrived and she saw that my nails needed polish removal.\n\nThat was when she GRABBED my cell phone from off the counter and said, \""You pay twenty or I keep your phone!\"" (!!!!!!!!) I calmly said to please give me my phone, I would pay her. After she handed it back, I said, \"" You cannot change the price after the service. I am not even happy with this, but I have still paid you. Goodbye.\""  No insults, no profanity, no yelling. I was holding her business card in my hand, and she grabbed roughly from my hand and crumbled it into a ball. (!!!!!) I had a few singles I had planned to walk back and give to the tech, but I was getting kind of nervous and upset.\n\n\nAs I turned to go, she ran out in front of me and STEPPED ON MY FOOT! This caused me to lose my balance and my flip flop went spinning across the floor, and she kicked it even further. (!!!!!) Plus,  there were a few other customers in pedicure chairs watching, and I said, \""Do you really want to do this? Assault a customer who has just paid you? Really?\"" Then another worker went up to her and spoke in Vietnamese, and she glared at me and said, \"" I call police on you! \"" I said to go ahead! She would be the one in trouble. But I was actually scared she was going to strike me!\n\nSo I fled, heart pounding, with nails that look sub par. I would never return, obviously. Wendy should be ashamed of herself. That's  a pitiful way to run a business."
4,"The exhaustive search is finally over!  I finally found a hair stylist who knows what he's doing, is friendly, takes his time, gives great conversation and a neck massage and is easy on the eyes.

I shouldn't have said such nice things about Bobby because now YOU people are making it difficult for ME to get an appointment (or as I like to call it, a date) with Bobby.  From now on, I'm going to start giving aliases for people who are in my reviews.  \n\nSo forget all the things I said about that Bobby guy, that was an alias that I made up.

4,"Simply one of the best Mexican hole-in-the-walls in Phoenix.  Though it may not look like much from the outside, inside El Bravo sports a quaint appearance and amazing Mexican food.  The chips are thin and crispy, and are just about perfect when they are hot.  Shredded beef or chicken tacos are great, as are the burritos and enchiladas.  The reasonable prices and fantastic food keep us coming back time after time."

Among many other things.\n\nThey have always been highly communicative, honest, and fair; informing me throughout the entire process of what needed to be fixed, detailing throughly how everything would be done and what it would need to cost. They have always fixed only what needed to be, and never anything more, not allowing me to repair something that would be unnecessary for me to do. They have always been very timely and productive with their work; I recently had to replace my alternator and they had the job finished within the day. They are knowledgable and friendly, always more than happy to explain in great detail any specific questions I have had.\n\nI firmly recommend Elliott's Auto Electric to anyone who needs a timely, cost effective repair by honest professionals who have a great understanding of their work."
1,Italian hero was decent but probably wouldn't come back for it.  The pasta salad was old and some of the pasta was starting to get hard.  No bueno.  Overall I'd say they are coming up short in too many levels. If you want a real Italian deli go to Niccolis not too far from here.  They have one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!
4,"Very happy with ease of Christmas tree shopping. Beautiful backdrop. Cookies, lights, hot cocoa, cider. A nice fire with seats and blankets. Ecstatic that we decided to turn in and buy our first tree here!!!"
0,"Overpriced and rude.. I wont give this place (or the asshole attendant) another cent of my money. \n\nThere was a spot on my hood so I was using the squeegee to get it off (it was less then the size of a dime) when the attendant runs out and tells me to stop using the squeegee on my hood. His reasoning, that the next person to use it expects a clean squeegee.. this doesn't make one bit of sense.. what would be the difference of me cleaning dead bugs off of my windshield or from the hood of my car? Nothing. Whether I used it on my hood or on my windshield the squeegee is getting dirty. \n\nAll it takes is one rude asshole to alienate a customer which he did with flying colors."
4,"A great garage with a great owner.  George goes above and beyond to provide quality service, fair prices, and detailed explanations of what's wrong with your car.  A recent experience demonstrates the honesty of this shop.  I had some engine lights turn on and auto zone ran a diagnostic that suggested some larger problems but after taking the car to George I found out that it turned out to just be a dying battery.  There is no other place in town I'll take my vehicles."
0,"I should give negative stars!! Went in for an oil change and trip check Friday April 25, 2014. I had planned a surprise Disneyland trip for my family and needed everything in tip top shape. Well right before our last mountain pass to San Diego, my check engine light is flashing and you smell something burning. There was a heaven sent heavy machinery auto shop at the top of the mountain that helped us as much as they could. Surprise surprise! My oil plug wasn't put back in properly. My car leaked all the oil. The engine ran so rough it broke my motor mount...now there is oil in the spark plug well. A cylinder went out, and ive went though 8 quarts of oil in 4 days!!! We cant even register an oil reading. Now I'm stuck in Anaheim, CA and I have work tomorrow. Kids have school. Completely ruined this trip!! Shame on you guys!!! This is not the end of this....STAY AWAY!!!!!! These good reviews must be friends of the owner....super shady!!!!"
2,This place is a great dive bar. We love the drink prices and the people here are laid back and cool. (no need to worry about any fights that I could tell) Highly recommend if you like dive bars. Also they have pool tables and darts.
1,"Decent food, but bad service. Our waitress must have had an egg roll up her butt or something that was distracting her. In all my years of dining I don't think I've ever had a server come to the table, ask only one of the two people sitting there what they wanted to drink, then walk away. Seriously - she got my friend's drink order and walked away! WTF? But then, get this, she did it again, when she came back with my friend's drink and asked if we were ready to order, I ordered my drink, and then she turned to my friend, got her order, and then turned to walk away. I stopped her this time, of course. Oh, and then later, she took my glass to get me a refill, and when she didn't come back for ten minutes, I started looking around for her, and there she was, wandering around the restaurant with it, no idea which table it was from.. The food was decent, like I said, nothing special, but edible, but with that kind of service, I ain't going back."
0,"Got there on a Sat morning at 11am, only 2 tables had customers( first clue). We wanted the breakfast buffet for $15 per person. Big dissapointment. They where already taking down the buffet items & it was only 11am (2nd clue). Went to the omlet bar and the cook looked grouchy and pissed to have to open back up. The sign said your choice of cheese but seems like the cook picks what type of cheese you want on your omlet. Even worse was the cold bacon, cold french toast, & yucky tasting cold dry pancakes. The self serve milk was room temperature. And to top it off they charged me 18% gratuity on parties of 6 or more. The whole tab was like $120.00 for the worst breakfast this summer. Only 2 things I liked about this restaurant, Samantha, our waitress and the fruit. Would definitaly NOT go back here. Theres a Mc Donalds down the street and you get the same quality of food for less than $20 for 6 people."
1,"I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. \n\nThe room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.\n\nFYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.\n\nMy main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.\n\nI guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else."
3,"My opinion of this Best Western completely depends on your expectations and what you're looking for.  Very reasonable price considering the free breakfast, free wi-fi, social hour, and a decent pool. We arrived with a young child  however and they need a little open space which is something these rooms don't afford. Overall....pretty good, if it was just the wife and I we would return when looking more for a decent place for a great rate. If we we're back with the kid we'd pass."
0,"I am preparing to travel with small dog and need pricing for health certificate.  I called a few places....when I called here I was told \""no pricing over the phone\"".  What?  Are you kidding?  Not even for the document? How about price for office visit?  NO...she told me no pricing given for ANYTHING over the phone.  I suspect it is on the same lines as a restaurant with no pricing on the menu...I can't afford it.  This was the ONLY place that could not give me a price for a simple office visit or health certificate."
0,"My wife and I had several experiences at this dentist that seemed to be motivated by his need to make money rather than our health.  Removal of teeth to install implants, veneers all across the top, expensive gum procedures.   For several years we felt very uncomfortable and pressured to spend money with the dire warning that our mouths were going to crumble in the near future.\n\nThe final straw was a call on his emergency line, only to be advised that Friday was his golf day, and Monday was when I could be seen.  I guess enough other people got implants to fund 4 day work weeks.  \n\nWould never, ever recommend this man, or his team, to anyone.  \n\nTurns out that we both have great teeth and the other dentist confirmed that not only were the procedures he recommended highly profitable, but that typically they also commit the patient to a lifetime of routine maintenance expenses to keep up the implants, veneers, etc."
1,"I have them such a glowing review before. \nI am really disappointed.\n\nEven though my first customor service rep was wonderful, this time I got a really rude lady named Tracy.  I just did not like the way she talked to me so much so that I just didn't even book a second trip.\n\nThere are so many competitors and the economy is not great right now.  Companies cannot afford to have the worst customer service.  I did call  Detours.  They were quite helpful."
1,"My boss asked for a referral for an interior designer to decorate our new office building so I reached out to the Yelp community and got turned on to Neilsen. I sent all the contact info on to my boss and she was thrilled that I had a referral for her so quickly! Brownie points for me! \n\nNosomuch. While Nielsen might be extremely talented, his follow through and time management were less than adequate. He wouldn't return my boss' phone calls without her leaving him several messages, was 2 weeks late turning in his proposal, and would go out of town for weeks at a time without letting her know he was gone....I could go on and on, but really, I don't want to re-live the embarrassment again. \n\nI know there is the chance that perhaps there were some crossed circuits here, especially since there are so many positive reviews, but honestly, something was amiss with this experience and that's why the low marks (I don't give a lot of low marks normally and it pains me to do so).\n\nI'm not saying don't use this company, because they are probably extremely talented, but I would evaluate the situation you're in before you recommend them to someone so you don't end up in the same predicament I am in."
2,"Delivery is super fast. If you think you can jump in the shower after you call in your order, you'll end up answering your door in a towel."
0,"BIG KIa on Bell Road is a  TOTAL RIP-Off! \nOnce you enter their premises you are attracted by all the outrageously low monthly posted on all their Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Then ,over-friendly salesmen scramble to sweet-talk you in buying it NOW. the usual low-interest rates , a mere 500 dollar down and all the hype about them assuring you 100 percent that bad credit/no credit would pose no problem and that once you sign up you get the key to your dream vehicle.which i did. and almost 30 days after i got a call from them saying there are some documents i needed to sign which they just overlooked. Lo and Behold when i got there they rudely demanded i pony up another 1500 dollars on top of my 500 dollars because my credit wasnt good enough. i countered with an additional 500 cash and they said they will get back to me after deliberating with the other members of their company. They came back and instead of acceding to my counter, they put on more demands. They now demanded i get a co-signor or else \""you can just take a cab\"" and go home as long as we leave the keys with them.\nI demanded that they put down their demand in writing so that everything is recorded in black and white, They refused to do so and again said in the most rudest of decorum that they would do us a favor by taking us home because there is no way we can leave the lot without either getting a co-signor or returning the key.  I asked if I could get my 500 back and they said yes but they would have to deduct a \""sizeable\"" amount for my using their vehicle and i would get a trickle of my 500 dollar cash back ,if at all.   I had to accede to their demand because i did load the vehicle with close to 1500 dollars of accessories like GPS, body-enhancement kits and the like and wanted to avoid the embarassment and humiliation.\nSo in the end i was able to get a co-signor and later on i found out that they intended to put additional charges to the original contract, probably sensing that my co-signor is financially \""loaded.\""\nI am examining my legal options. This has caused me great aggravation .   Other prospective car buyers, BEWARE!\nThe dealership is a total Let-Down! A Total Joke! Rip-Off Artists of the Highest Calibre.\nThey are just to make a quick buck. They instantaneously give away the key to your desired vehicle because they know that they can earn fat commissions if your credit goes through .And if your credit isnt in the best of shape they know they can always threaten you to get a co-signor or charge you outrageous  through-the-roof car-rental rates .\nOnce you sign the contract all signs of friendliness disppear and you are left to your own devices. The salesman i talked to admitted that his job is to \""sales-talk\"" and that is what he is being paid to do which means he will stop at nothing and say all those sweet-sounding lies and half-truths til you get bamboozled into signing. After that everything goes downhill. A bunch of good-for-nothing scam artists!"
0,"Horrible.  The tools were shared between customers, she squirted oil on my toe nails, and immediately placed them in the water, didnt even rub the oil in, at all.  She got up three times in the middle of my leg massage to answer her cell phone or help other clients, the actual massage probably only lasted 30 seconds because she kept getting up. and to top it off, the paint on my nails arent even even!  I am going to redo them.  I got robbed."
0,The worse service ever She went to charge me and said the last time I was in the machine didn't work and charged me for the last time i was in. Ripped off!!!Will never go there again!!!
3,"STILL HAPPY!!   The other day I ordered some Kung Pao shrimp and Shrimp Chow Mein for take out that was honestly dreadful.  I called the next day to complain and was asked what I wanted to do.  So the following day (two days after the original take out) I went back and got replacements for the original order.  They did not ask for a receipt, they did not ask for the original containers back,  ALL they wanted was for me to be a happy customer.  No surprise the food was delicious as always.   Every one has an off-day, it is how you react  that is what I look for.   I am honestly relieved that I can still recommend this place and have my old stand-by when I am in the mood for good Chinese food.   Good job guys!!!"
3,"This place is awesome.  I'm a total girl and lacking in bike repairing ability.  Hell, I didn't even realize that bikes need maintenance.  Whoops.  Anyhow, they've tuned up my bike and fixed several flats for me.  I suck at cleaning/oiling my chain, but Eric takes care of me.  Everyone is super nice and knowledgeable, but I'm partial to Eric.  They've also ordered a bike rack for me and helped me install it, because obviously I am no good with manual skills....  I will definitely be back when I need to purchase another bike."
3,"My hubby and his father \""fixed\"" the constant running of water from the guest bathroom toilet.  Funny, how it was running again after my FIL leaves.  I swear it was just story telling and drinking.  LOL!  Anyways, I told my hubby get it fix or sleep in the tub!  The running water was driving me crazy.  He found Johnco online and give them a call.  \n\nOur tech, Jason came out and fixed the issue.  On his way out, my hubby asked him about the leaking drip system and if he knew anyone to fix it.  He gave us 2 options.  We took the cutting off supply to the drip system, since we were not using it anyways.  \n\nAbout 1 day later the toilet was leaking water outside this time.  Oh boy, this is not good.  We called and left a message.  Then we call again the next day, they asked a series of questions.  They sent out the same tech.  He explained the issue and fix it for GOOD."
0,"As a bit of a chili head, I have to say that I was very very excited about the atomic wing challenge here. Unfortunately, when we arrived we were informed that no such challenge existed anymore but they still have the wings. My coworkers and I excitedly ordered a round of the atomic wings and the wait began.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, the surroundings finally started to set in. I had noticed a bit of an odor when we arrived but hadn't paid it much mind. As it increased in intensity, I didn't have much of a choice anymore. Apparently, lunchtime is the ideal time of day to pump the raw sewage out and it just happened to run right through the door right in front of me. Not a good start.\n\nThe food finally arrives. This is going to be what makes it all worth it. I smell my wings and there is a little bit of noticeable tang and a some jalapenos on top. I take a bite nervously. Sort of cold. No noticeable spice. At all. Soupy wing sauce that doesn't taste very good on top of wings that I'm pretty sure just came from the grocer's freezer and found their way into Sport Pepper's microwave. Death knell.\n\nThe service wasn't bad but wasn't impressive either. Overall, between the dingy, dark decor, the overpowering smell of raw sewage, and the absolutely lackluster food, I just don't see myself ever being able to justify coming back.\n\nIt's unfortunate. I was really looking forward to this, too."
0,"Worst return policy in town!  The store manager did not even respect me, the paying customer, enough to come to the customer service desk to discuss a requested return. I tried to return a brand new dress with the tags attached and the original receipt, however, because I purchased the item more than 30 days ago they refused to issue me a credit to my Visa.  I was given a store credit.  My fiance tried to return a defective bottle of cologne this past weekend (the pump spray stopped working) and they would not exchange the defective item for a working item. We will be taking all of our business away from Ross and shopping at other discounters like Target, Anna's Linens, Tuesday Mornings, TJ Maxx, anywhere but Ross."
4,"This was an overall great experience. We took our very wary two year old son here for his third haircut in Sunday. We walked in and the wait wasn't long at all. The place was clean, we were greeted and signed up right away. There was a train table (older but all the kids loved it!) and a table with Lego Duplos. Our son was able to relax and play a bit before it was his turn which helped. \n\nHe got to pick his chair and was able to sit in the fire truck. He was so nervous about it, but Veronica was amazing. She totally put him at ease, gave him good ideas for distraction and did a great job on his hair cut. We are DEFINITELY coming back here! He was smiling at the end and told us he had fun. The price was really good as well."
4,I drive from North Scottsdale to see Karen. She's been doing all if my kids hair for years since she was at the Scottsdale location. Coming from NYC I was very particular in who touched my sons hair. I like his hair cut not shaved like a barbershop. She takes her time and does exactly what I ask her to do.
4,i have been taking my 13 month old son for his haircuts here since he was 8 months. they are friendly and efficient. the ladies who work here are quick and efficient. leave my son with the haircut i requested and while doing it in a fun quick way .\neasy to schedule appointment and very clean. great environment.
4,"We had Jessica, she was great! Our 14 month old boy's haircut turned out perfectly and she was very patient with him wiggling around! He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!"
0,"Wow, what a complete ass the owner is. Walked in with a simple power board with some bad capacitors and he refused to even look at it. Went on a 5 minute tirade about the internet and amateurs and how he's sick of helping people and wasting his savings on this business. I just backed out of his cigarette-smelling store in disbelief. Stay FAR away from this nut."
1,"Mediocre Thai food. I had the Pad kee Mao, a dish that was supposed to be wok fried in a chili and garlic sauce, but I tasted no garlic and little chili - it was asi, asi. My lunch companion thoroughly enjoyed his panang curry and was sweating up a storm from the spice.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish.  Oh well, it doesn't matter, with so many delicious options for Thai food in the valley, I probably won't return."
1,"The store near Bell and 7th St. was filthy.\nThe employee making the pizza obviously had a cold or sniffles or something.  Repeatedly touched his face and handled the food.\n\nMy slice of pizza was very good.\nBut the utensils were all soiled, the tables were dirty, windows dirty, etc.\n\nBeen to this and other Ray's pizza locations many times."
3,"Great job here as always, but they often mischarge me...rather, overcharge me"
0,"Yet another bad experience with Arizona Federal Credit Union. This morning I placed an order with a company in Scotland for some clothing. (Yes, a kilt). Two hours later I tried to use my debit card for a $2 breakfast and it was declined. While I am glad to have escaped  BofA's high fees by taking my business to a CU, at least BofA would call when they froze a card for a suspicious transaction. I didn't have to figure it out on my own.\nWhen I called the AZFCU call center to unlock the card they made me feel like it was my fault I wasn't notified.\nThe staff at AZFCU really need better customer service training. I also bet there is no trouble ticket in their system to get suspicious transaction notification fixed."
0,If there were an option for 0 stars that's what I'd choose. This place should be shut down. Years ago I made the mistake of taking my puppy Lucy to get spayed here and from the get go the staff was very rude and acted as if they were put out answering any questions I had at all. Later that day I picked Lucy up and her incision looked like a giant sloppy wound you would see in a horror movie. When I asked about it they assured me it was fine and would not send home any pain meds for her. The next few days Lucy was in extreme pain wailing and crying all night which shouldn't be the case. I thought that experience was bad but nothing compared to my brother's. Just yesterday my brother took his puppy Leo here to get neutered when they picked Leo up he was bleeding everywhere. When they brought it to the vets attention they assured them that it's normal to stop worrying. So they took him home. Well the bleeding wasn't normal he kept bleeding profusely to the point that his scrotum was completly filled up with blood and swollen up huge. This is the point they took him to the emeegency pet clinic where they gasped and said it is definatly not normal. They kept Leo overnight and good thing. They said if he wasn't brought in there was a good chance he would have bled out overnight. They also informed him that they get quite a few emergencies that come in after going to this hack shop North Phoenix Spay and Neuter Clinic. So take it from me if you can avoid this place at all cost if your pet means anything to you. I will never step foot in this place again.
4,"We had a wonderful experience with them.  They were friendly, readily available, and we liked how they weren't pushy with their sales.  After calling a few places for information and not liking their attitude and scheduling a free estimate with another company that pulled a no show, we went to Tile and Carpent Mecca on the recommendation of a co-worker.  We wanted to put in wood style laminate flooring in our hallways, dining, and kitchen area.  They came and did a free estimate and they were on time, didn't give us a two hour window, and they were in and out without trying to force a sale on me.  I liked this so my husband and I met with them on a Sunday in their shop (they opened to accomodate us) and they were friendly and honest from the get go.  They told us that we could probably find a cheaper alternative but the quality and service most likely wouldn't compare to theirs.  They said they aren't the cheapest but definitely not the most expensive.  They have a wide range of styles and price options available.  Once we placed our order, things got going and we are so happy with the results.  They had 3 guys come to our home to do the work, but we liked how the owner showed up with them initially, did random check-ins, and came afterwards to meet with us to discuss what we thought.  We've gotten so many compliments, we would definitely use them again.  The couple who owns the business are very sweet and down to earth.  It comforted me to know that we were supporting their livelihood and local business, so their reputation was on the line.  As opposed to if we ordered from Home Depot or Express Tile, the workers probably don't really care because they're in and out of peoples homes so quickly and they're not personally invested in the work."
2,"The food tasted really good, the time to make it, however, took a while."
0,"So ..according to The Sewers of New York, this was 75.00 dollars worth of food?!?! The food was edible and the service was sub par at best, and to top it off when we advised them of our displeasure, they didn't offer to make it right. Thank goodness we still have several days of our family reunion left!"
1,"We had a family function here and I was sadly disappointed. I felt that the entrees were of average quality , but the service was terrible. We had made a reservation days in advance yet still the staff seemed unprepared for our service. We sat for ages until we finally had to ask for them to take our orders. I believe I asked for wine, then water 3 times as did other members of our party until my husband just started walking up to the bar and basically serving our party drinks."
2,"On the past experience of my friend with this Chinese restaurant, we went and tried Bamboo House. My friend did all the ordering... maybe we'll change that procedure on our next restaurant visit. Bamboo House claims to be a Chinese restaurant, but also lists Thai and Vietnamese creations.\n\nWhat we ordered...\n\nStarters: Seafood Soup - This was a very thick soup filled to the brim with seafood ingredients: Shrimp, Scallops, Abalone, Fish, vegetables, and some ingredients I could not recognize! Mistake #1: The soup itself had a tap water aftertaste! My friend disagreed... but I know I tasted tap water!\n\nDrinks: Mai Tai - Yummy, yummy... sweet and very alcoholic. The bartender really knows how to mix his drinks. And you get a little umbrella \""thing\"" with your drink!\n\nMain Dishes: \n\nHouse Special Chicken - This dish was essentially Chinese Fried Chicken in a batter immersed in their \""special\"" sauce. The batter was slightly crispy when bitten into, and was especially tasty and had interesting textures when consumed.\n\nKung Pao Chicken II - Off menu Kung Pao Chicken without the Cashews. Skinned Chicken with Shrimp, Mushrooms, Peas, Water Chestnuts, and Celery covered by their \""special\"" sauce.\n\nBoth dishes were supposed to be spicy \""hot\"".... NOT!\n\nMistake #2: Never duplicate any meat dishes... we discovered both dishes were immersed in their \""special\"" sauce which made differentiation of the dishes difficult, at best! Did I just have the House Special or the Kung Pao? Let me take a close look! Not very creative cooking!\n\nDemographics of restaurant: All Caucasian clientele. Less than 30% of capacity.\nLocated in a small strip mall setting.\nService was friendly and attentive.\n\nProbably will not be coming back here for the food... But maybe for the Polynesian style drinks... They're pretty refreshing and Good!\n\nNext visit to any restaurant... I'm ordering for both of us!\n\nMy Friend's rating: 3\nMy rating:               2.25 (Saved by MaiTai)"
0,"My girlfriend and I ate here recently and I get nauseas thinking about this place.\n\nI ordered a seafood dish with noodles and veggies. The scallops were still very cold in the center. The little corncobs (cant think of the name) tasted stale in my dish as well as my girlfriends. I could only eat a few bites and I had to quit. \n\nI hate complaining when I go places and I should have said something to them, but instead I will simply not return and let others know to avoid this place. Simply put, the food sucks and this place needs to close."
1,"Meh, I've experienced better, pretty much covers it.\n\nThe young man who brought water and tea didn't know what tea he was serving us. No straws were brought- big peeve of mine. I dislike drinking from cups at restaurants.\n\nThe egg rolls tasted of perfume. Chicken chow mien was ok, $5.95 for M-F lunch special. They never asked if we wanted desert."

2,"I bought a Groupon for a cut, deep conditioning treatment, and style with Cassidy. This salon, and Cassidy, we're very friendly, and showed great customer service. The shampoo include a scalp and neck massage which was awesome. She massaged deep conditioner into my hair, covered it with a cap, then stuck me under the hair dryer for 10 minutes for unto soak in. Once she started to cut and style my hair I could tell that she wasn't very experienced, especially since it took her a very long time to blow dry my hair with a round brush. Unfortunately the hair cut turned out choppy and uneven, and she took off more than I asked for. I usually wear straight bangs, but told her that I would like to start wearing them to the side. She textured my bangs so they were as thick, but didn't trim them at all. She just pushed my bangs to the side, and put a lot of hairspray on them. When I got home and looked at my hair closer I am very disappointed."
0,"Regularly visit UPS locations all along Bell Rd as I have a small painting business with my fiancee and often ship express tubes with canvas in them. This location is by far the worst experience we've ever had with UPS. We had our tubes and canvas ready to pack on site and only needed to borrow some packing tape to get everything together. We were told by the owner that \""it would cost us\"" and he pointed to the wall behind us where Scotch packing tape w/dispensers and rolls of thicker tape with out a dispensers were hanging. Fine. We don't usually expect to have to pay for tape since every other store offers it for free for people to pack items themselves. We decided to grab the roll with out the plastic cutting dispenser since those have had a history of breaking in my experience. We turned back around to ask to possibly use their more heavy duty dispenser but the guy had disappeared into a mail room. We called to him a couple times, \""Sir?...sir??\"". Nothing. A little louder and I woke him up and got him to come back into our ongoing conversation. \""Sir, we'll buy this roll but can we use your cutting dispenser?\"" \""No. No, I can't allow that. Those tapes have cutting dispensers there.\"" We could tell this guy clearly didn't want to give us an inch of courtesy and the reason was unclear. We were nothing but pleasant to him. We placed the roll back on the wall and left. Obviously this guy gets so much business he doesn't need us to ever come back again as customers."
0,"I had quite an awful experience with Suzie's Mama Bear several years back.  It's been a while since it happened (about 7 years ago), but I definitely believe it is a cautionary experience worth sharing. \n\nI am now severnteen, but a while back ago, I used to be enrolled in Suzie's Mama Bear after school. It was just about the worst daycare experience I could describe for a child, but given my age, I was not able to articulate it to anyone. \n\nThe daycare, as I remember it, was a wild mess. Children were swearing all over, and none of the adults there would do anything about it. I had a dietary restriction to where I could not have milk, so my mother personally instructed them not to give me regular milk and brought them the milk substitute I should have drank for during snack time. The lady in charge never even bothered to use it, so I was unknowingly drinking regular milk each day without knowing it and having my health harmed.\n\nOne day, I was pushed by one of the older kids who was at the daycare, as bullying was quite normal there. I fell on my arm the wrong way and broke my wrist in multiple areas. I had to repeatedly ask the adult there to call my mom over the course of an hour before she actually instructed someone to make the phone call. Then, I had to wait about an hour and a half for the staff to actually call my mother because they seemed to view it as low-priority, thinking I may have just hurt myself. By the time I had arrived at the emergency room, it had been over three hours since I broke my wrist. \n\nSince then, I don't know what sort of changes have been made with the daycare, but I wanted to share my perspective. I definitely do not think this is a place anyone should be taking their children."
2,Nothing fancy here but the price is right: $17 for a pedicure and plenty of polish colors to choose from.
1,"After visiting Earnhardt Lexus looking at the ES300h but not really getting serious I went to Bell Lexus thinking they would have a better selection.  They didn't but I took a test drive anyway. \nAfter a short test drive we sat down to go over the numbers.  I was unimpressed with the negotiations.  Although they were polite, they seemed relatively dysfunctional.  Earnhardt had mentioned incentive financing which oddly the Bell Lexus folks couldn't or wouldn't match.\nI went back to Earnhardt and got the car I wanted at a better price, with the financing Bell didn't (wouldn't) offer, and a better deal on my trade-in.  \nTo summarize, Bell Lexus was not really competitive on price, financing, or trade-in, but other than that they were OK."
1,"I wish that I could have got ahold of Sherry's Pampered Pets so that I could have made the reservation that I needed. But after 2 attempts at contacting them by phone and leaving them a voicemail that never got returned, I never even got as far as making the reservation. I waited 3-4 days for a return phone call, and then made reservations elsewhere. If I can't even get ahold of anyone or get a return phone call after leaving a voicemail, I am sure not leaving my dog with you."
1,"About what one would expect from a conglomerate fast food chain as far as the food quality goes, but what was especially remarkable today was the very poor customer service. I sat outside, and when the employee brought my lunch out and did not bring a fork, she acted almost joyous that she got to tell me that I have to go inside to get my own fork. She will have no future in customer service I'm sure of that.\n\nThis was at 2:30 on 11/2/13."
2,"Love the bagels.  But . . . Need to have the boxes ready for grab and go. Never seem to have them ready when I get here, thus waiting in line contrary to the program. Bummer."
4,"Went with family last night...loved it! Our server, Julie, was excellent- extremely friendly and attentive to our table. The stuffed mushroom and shrimp scampi appetizers were delicious...excellent for dipping the really good garlic bread in the sauces. :) My daughter said that the fettuccine alfredo (not on the menu, but offered) was the best she's ever tasted. The butternut squash ravioli was very rich (almost too rich) but quite tasty. The guys both got the crab and shrimp stuffed ravioli with walnut cream sauce (not on the regular menu)- both loved it!  It's a really great place for a special date or a quaint dinner with friends."
2,"basic food, nothing special, but all tasted good.  Limited menu, funny wine selection, no multipuciano, or other usual italian wines.  Just the popular basics.  Right next to Goodwill, but better than you'd expect"
0,DO NOT COME HERE! I'm not sure why this restaurant gets the reviews it does. First off... salmon is not white... its pink.  We spent 25 dollars on the special that was far from special.  Dried out crab stuffed in white chewing salmon. Really?\nThe veal... don't get us started.  Chewy and I'm not convinced it was actually veal. The vegetables on both plates were not even luke warm.  \nGo to Babbo and spend a 3/4 of what we did.  What I'd do to have my 80 plus dollars back!  Summed up... just buy a tv dinner and save the cash!

1,Got here at 645 to be first for an oil change took 40 min to get car on rack. 15 minutes in the air to get the oil drained. Watched 3 employees talk about nothing before that even started. No one in lobby to great you and the customer waiting area has garbage in it from Thursday when I dropped in to try and get the oil changed then
4,"Spinato's. Where shall we begin? First of all my boyfriend and I were looking to try someplace new, and thanks to you Yelpers we found Spinato's!\nFANTASTIC PIZZA.  I feel ruined.  I could never eat from another pizza joint and feel okay about it...This place is in its own league.\nThe only knock on this location is the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired. We'll be back :)"
3,"I am a Chicagoan. Not the suburbs of Chicago, but the heart of the city. There are a number of things I miss about my city: Garrett's popcorn, neighbood festivals every weekend, Lou Malnati's pizza and of course my family.....not necessarily in that order. When someone says they have Chicago-style pizza I feel it is my duty to try it. There are a bunch of pizza places in Chicago that have amazing pizza and they all do it differently so there isn't just way one to make Chicago-style pizza, but Spinato's came pretty damn close. \n\nWe ordered the Chicago-style with 1/2 mushroom for my man. The mixture of yellow and red bell pepper was a nice touch, most places use green bell peppers. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side, I'm not used to that. The pizza was not greasy, had the right amount of cheese and toppings and the cornmeal crust reminded me of home. \n\nI'm happy to say that Spinato's lived up to the hype."
4,"Probably the best place for pizza and calzones. I love the atmosphere and service here. Its very mom & pop, but professional and fun at the same time. I've  taken my friends and family here, and both groups are quite critical in their own way... but they LOVED the place. My best friend Anthony is from NM and seriously comes to visit me because of our frequent visits to Spinatos - not to see me. \n\nObsessed with the spinach calzones. Joey is my favorite server. the riesling is divine.\n\nA+"
4,"The gluten-free pizza at this place is amazing. In fact, I'd say it's the best gluten-free pizza I've had since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease seven years ago. Unfortunately, I don't live in Arizona, but I can pretty much guarantee I'll be ordering the spinach special gluten-free pizza every time I come visit family. Bonus points: Redbridge gluten-free beer for only $3 a bottle!"
0,"After reading all of the rave reviews for Spinato's we decided to give it a try.  We get pizza for Friday dinner often and I was looking for something better and closer to home.  This location is a few blocks off of my normal route, so I put in an online order for two pizzas.  Having had fast food places miss online orders in the past, I gave the shop a call to confirm that the order was received and that it would be ready on-time.  \nWe had other plans for later in the evening so timing was critical.\nAt the scheduled time I arrived at Spinato's expecting to go in, pick-up two pizzas and leave.  \nNo such luck.  One of the 'clerks' in the take-out area started pushing buttons and making odd faces at the register.  Then he called the other clerk over and the both start mashing buttons and making faces at two registers.  Then the short one says, \""I'm sorry, I don't have an order for you, I can make it up in about 10 minutes?\""  Knowing that they normally need 40 minutes to get their pizzas ready, I was looking at undercooked pizza or no pizza.  I opted for the second choice and left.  \n\nKFC for dinner.\n\nA half an hour after I was home and finishing the chicken, someone from Spinato's calls and says \""We have your pizza waiting\"".  I told the young lady that the call was not appreciated and that I was in the store at the scheduled time and they had no order for me.  \n\nThen to add insult to injury, 3 hours after that, I get a text telling me that my order was confirmed.\n\nNot done . . .\n\nMy daughter really wanted to try the pizza and thought that the mistake was a one- time thing and we should still try the pizza.\n\nOK, we'll get pizza for Saturday.  So I run 20 miles each way to pick-up the same order they had lost at one store and picked it up from another location. \n\nYou can get better pizzas from the grocer's freezer.  \n\nThe crust is flat, no edge, looks like it was runout on a sheeter (machine that rolls out dough). \n\nThe sauce is tasteless, and just that, canned tomato sauce.  \n\nThe meats were also bland, who would expect that from a sausage and pepperoni pizza?\n\nPeople, this is not good pizza. . .  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n were"
3,"This place has become one of my new Chicago style Pizza places in this area. Been driving past this restaurant for way too long and finally decided to stop in and give them a visit.\n\nThey have a pretty good selection of many of the Windy City's mouth watering favorites. Inside is cozy and decorated with a traditional pizza parlor theme. There is also a nice patio outside for when the weather is enjoyable. Perfect during the nicer times of the year.\n\nTheir menu here consist of Appetizers, Salads, Baked Sandwiches, Pastas and plenty of Pizzas and Calzones. If you leave here hungry you are in big trouble. We always have a good portion of leftover pizza to bring home. Great for a midnight snack or when you have those late night munchies.\n\nExtremely friendly service. They will let you order your pizza and split it right down the middle. You can go crazy with two totally different kinds. They put a small line of sauce that shows you where it changes. Nice!\n\nSo far we have tried a 14\"" Chicago on one side and the Combo version on the other. Came back a few weeks later and did a 14\"" half Canadian with Nicole's Favorite on the other side. Great flavors with some really tasty ingredients. The pizza sauce here is a Chicago recipe and sweeter than what you would get at a NY pizza joint. So get ready and don't be surprised.\n\nCan't wait to try out their Italian Beef Sandwich and maybe a Chicago Steak Calzone. They even have Dessert. Saw the Cannolis last time but had no more room and was ready to explode.\n\nBring the family and friends. They will make you feel right at home. Get the thin crust so you can eat more without getting filled up. They also have thick crust for you dough lovers out there. PIZZA TIME!\n\n4.25 STARS"
4,Stand up guys. Scott took care of me and didn't pressure me into any repairs. He was kind enough to quote the needed repairs and offered to just do the bare minimum (safely of course) to get me back on the road.  I'll be referring friends to this shop so long as they are in business.
2,"So I'm a coffee fan through and through, and Starbucks to be sure is near the top my list usually. While this Starbucks is fine, staff service seems to be lacking. \n\nService is make a break, and unfortunately it's not making the grade today."
4,"ok -- so it's a dealership service center right?  just a GM corner of the world to take your money and leave you 'needing more' (more money or more repairs) ....right??   NOPE!  \n\nLund has always taken GREAT care of  my car. I have a little Saab and well, truth be told, it's needed a few repairs, one being pretty significant ....regardless i still LOVE MY SAAB!  \n\nEach time I have taken my car in, the service writers (Phil / Steve) have been GREAT!  They are helpful and know the vehicle -- they always makes sure i'm in/out of there as promised.   Their estimates are fair (i've compared them with others!!) and actually Lund tends to come in even less than they originally quoted.  Not sure about you but i'd rather be happily surprised with a smaller bill.\n\nWhen I pick up my car, I get a very detailed walk through of what they serviced, what i need to look out for, etc.  I also always return home in a very well cleaned car!  (nice little perk!) \n\nPrior to the economic bust - they gave me a free rental car each visit (all varieties of Saabs and even a CTS). That totally ROCKED ...but now, they only have the van service, which is still good - prompt, clean and courteous. \n\nThe waiting area has a variety of drinks/ snacks and tv / magazines to keep you entertained. Not the crazy \""spa, movie theater, yoga, tech center\"" auto mall thing --but it serves me just fine!!  Always a danish or a bagel to be had -- even cookies / ice cream and pop corn !!! (ohhh it's a party over there!!)  hehehe \nbut seriously, i don't need to have my car repair bill to be more expensive so it can cover the yoga instructor or the spa service expenses -- i just want my car taken care of.\n\nMaybe it's a Cadillac Hummer Saab thing - but  I am a LOYAL LUND fan!  \njust sayin"

4,"The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.  \n\nYou'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good."
4,Amazing food! Some of the best curry we have had! So craveable & authentic !!
3,"Love this little, genuine place! It has great lunches and has ruined me for pad Thai anywhere else in the valley! Their soups are a must!"
0,"This place is a ripoff. I had a storage unit for 2 years here. When I deceided to give it up they would not prorate my fees when I was told by the staff and manager that they prorate fees. They had no concern for my situation, the staff is very unfriendly. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."
1,"I was hoping for a spectacular neighborhood diner but it's rather ordinary as far as food, menu, and atmosphere.  I had a full breakfast and everything was just ok, service was just ok, and I don't think they've updated the furniture for decades.  Must be the location that explains their success, and those retired folks sitting up at the counter."
2,"Pinky's is a great place to stop for breakfast, or to grab a quick sandwich. The prices are good, and the service is friendly. It's the perfect place to take your really picky nephew who won't eat anything but grilled cheese or spaghetti... because they have something that he will eat."

4,"I have been adopted by a cat. It's been in the 'hood for months. For the past few weeks it was bunking on my patio furniture at night and would run if I tried to get near, but this past week it started coming into my house for its slumber. So, I figured I best make sure the little guy's healthy (fortunately, it had already been neutered so I don't have to worry about the \""multiplying like rabbits\"" phenomenon.). That's what made me think to review Dr. Stewart Cellers and Desert Hills Animal Hospital. \n\nWhen you walk through the door at Desert Hills you are, most often, greeted by a lovely white-haired lady named Lynne. I will never forget her kindness when my cat, Sissy, was hospitalized there for a few days. Lynne took such great care nursing her, always willing to answer my call with a progress report. From her updates, it was clear she was really getting to know MY cat. And, when the end was near for Sissy, the staff at Desert Hills were so supportive and empathetic... taking turns comforting my kitty. I'm so grateful for them! \n\nDr. Cellers is very knowledgeable and willing to take time answering questions. He gives great detail but does not confuse with medical jargon. He explains ALL options, is honest , empathetic and doesn't push. And, when you call for updates or test results, he'll be the one to speak to you directly! \n\nOffice visits/exams are about $30 which, I think, is pretty reasonable. Today, we wound up doing an exam and a full panel of blood work on my yet-to-be-named addition (to make sure all organs are functioning properly, no FIV or feline leukemia, etc.) and it ran about $150. \n\nI wouldn't even consider going some place else!"
3,"Now I'm not from Kansas City but I started eating meat again awhile ago and I'm pretty picky about what kind of meat I put in my mouth believe it or not! I havent had a pork sandwich in a few years and I usually hate teh pork!! The way this was cooked, seriously it was not fatty or I never would have polished the whole thing off. I liked it that much! I have no qualms with throwing shitty food in the garbage where it belongs. The taste was really good with just the right smokey flavor the meat was tender and not dry. I was so full I didnt even touch my sides so I cant say anything about the fries, onion rings, or slaw. It was a bit pricey but this totally hit the spot for me the other night....that is all!"
1,The last time I went I was sooo happy with the food now I'm sooo sad. The day before New Yrs Eve I was craving some good BBQ. I promised myself no more meat except fish starting New Years. So this was pretty much my last hoorah. I was looking forward to it ALL day!! I had a burnt ends sandwich with fries and onion rings. Well I couldn't even finish the sandwich! It was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty. About half way through my stomach started crying for help. I felt like dude on Man Vs. Food I was determined to eat it but it turned awful. I had to stop eating and I thought I was going to die. I had a gallon of tea after that and luckily pulled through alive. Not at all like last time. NOT ONE BIT!! Oh fries were not good either not like McD's they were pretty greasy more like Two Hippies but without the thickness. Onion rings were ok  meh nothing to write about.\n\nStill sad about the whole thing!

4,"I have been taking my doberman here for daycare for about 3 months after I was referred to them by a coworker who uses them as her vet - I have not switched to using them as my vet, but I may decide to in the future. \n\nI actually went to the facility without my dog and did a walk through and talked to the staff / trainers before I decided I would take my boy there I wanted to check it out.  I know probably a little overboard, but my dog is basically my child and I wanted to be sure that I would be comfortable leaving him there for a day - I actually visited 3 other places and this one was BY FAR the best. \n\nThe price is fair (about $17 per day for daycare) and they have a HUGE yard with grass, trees, kiddie pools, sprinklers. Last week the vet called me to say that Trey (my boy) was bleeding from his mouth - he probably bit himself or got too frisky with another dog - she said not to worry and that she would keep him in her office until the bleeding stopped. He likes to play rough so I completely understand that these things can and do happen. \n\nTo the guy who complained about his dog not being supervised and having to get stitched up: its a risk that you take when you bring your dog to a place like this - just like at the dog park things happen. What else should they have done?  Your dog got hurt and they fixed him..... I have been several times, andI know someone is always watching the dogs, but the yard is big and the dogs are free to roam around. \n\nAnother positive - their grooming prices are very reasonable and the staff is super friendly."
1,"This place seems like they gave up on watering all their plants - and not adding any new ones - a year ago...reminiscent of the final days of a going-out-of-business sale. \n\nThe slim selection of mostly desert plants looked mostly half-dead, even the cacti. There was a small selection of citrus trees (priced in the $100's) that were skinny as a pencil and had dried, shrunken fruit (lemons or limes so black you couldn't tell exactly what they were) falling off. In the green houses were more less-than-stellar looking plants.\n\nThere was a good sample of Mexican pottery, recycled steel landscape ornaments, and painted steel wall ornaments. Much of it was enjoyable to look at, but the prices were much more than I wanted to pay. \n\nOnly reason I didn't give this one star is that the young attendant was courteous and friendly.\n\nI had bought a $100 LivingSocial Coupon for $40.50 (with promotion), but after checking out the selection, decided to head home and get my money back. I went to Home Depot the next day and got five healthy plants for under $40 - which probably wouldn't have bought one similar type plant at Desert Gardens.\n\nUnless you are on the hunt for some particular rare cactus to fill your collection, save your money and time and go to Home Depot or even Wal-Mart!"
4,"Had a battery fail which had been put in in Minnesota at a Valvoline so I checked locally to see if it was still covered under warranty. I spoke to Tyler who looked my account up while I was on the phone and found that my battery was covered, but that Valvoline no longer stocked that battery. He assured me they could replace it with a different one, but it would have to be ordered in which would take a couple of days. No problem for me and saved me a couple of hundred dollars.  He later called me to let me know when it was in. I then met Tyler when I came in to have it replaced and get my oil changed. He was just as organized, personable and efficient as he'd been on the phone. There are a lot fewer Valvoline's in AZ than in MN, so it is so nice that one is somewhat conveniently located to me and supplies the same exceptional customer service and friendliness. Even more, the owner of the Valvoline called me himself, as a random customer service check, and was also exceptionally nice and caring.  It's been more than six months, but my experience as Valvoline remains the best customer service experience I have had in the 2.5 years I have been in Phoenix.  That one person, Tyler, took control of my issue and handled it flawlessly from beginning to end over the course of less than a week seems to be a rare thing in AZ (much more common in the Midwest - so I am still adjusting expectations) and I remain so impressed, that as a client, it was all handled with minimum effort, follow-up or inconvenience on my part, that I wanted to write this review in the hope you can have a great customer service experience as well!"

0,"what is it with my luck paying money for services that fail to fix my problem? I went in to Big O Tires after seeing an advertisement on their window for an A/C check. After driving around 2 wks in a hot as hell car I said enough is enough and gave them a call to diagnose the problem. I was told that I was almost a pound low on freon and sent on my way. Yay! Cheapest option, right? Wrong. So very very wrong. Unfortunately I dropped by an hour before closing so I'm guessing I was rushed out while they were closing shop. They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150. As I pulled into my driveway 15 minutes later my car was no cooler at all.\n\nNext day I book it there to see what they could do since I just dropped some cash there. \""Come in Saturday and my A/C guy will take a look.\"" Fine.\n\nCome Saturday I'm praying for a leak somewhere. Hey! I paid $15 for flourescent dye! It better prove useful. 30 minutes later and I'm told it is low. \""So it leaked since Monday?\"" I asked. \""Monday?\"" \""Yes. I brought it in Monday and paid for an evac and recharge.\"" He had no idea. Smell something fishy yet? So he takes it back again and looks it over finally coming back to say he was wrong about it being low (REEEEEAAALLY FISHY) and it is either one of two parts. I was referred to a shop for them to check as they couldn't do it there but they couldn't refund me for the evac and recharge. However I could have this shop do the repairs and Big O wouldn't charge for the second evac and recharge that would have to be done on my car. First off... nobody would let someone leave their shop after doing work only to have someone else finish the job. WTF.\n\nSo here I am now spending a grand for a new A/C today when $29.95 was supposed to diagnose this a week ago.\n\nIf you are feeling charitable, at least pick a more honest organization to throw your hard earned money at. Now if you excuse me, I have a district manager to write."

However, the waitress, Amy, was completely RUDE to us! After looking at my sister's ID, went to get a waiver for her to sign because her ID was, of course, still strait up and down. She laid it on the table and said in her snotty tone: \""Be prepared, you're gonna be filling out A LOT of these tonight!\"" The only other words she communicated to us were rude, as well. Of course, the rest of the night, we didn't sign one single waiver. We told Amy we just wanted the two shots and then we'd like the check, but she didn't come back for another twenty minutes after giving us the shots! WE had to flag her down to get her to finally come back to the table, and the place wasn't busy at all. My fianc\u00e9 and I had been to this Gallagher's many times before and loved it, but Amy ruined our experience and we won't be coming back.  \nWe came in smiling and she totally killed the mood."

Everyone seems to be closed for vacation.\nFirestone is literally up the street; we had the car towed there, and the opening hours were definitely a huge plus. 7 am is perfect if you need to drop off your car before work.\nThe prices, in my opinion, are inflated, as are most of these chain auto places-and they always suggest a million other things that your car should get, but that you don't necessarily need.\nThey were there for me in a pinch and I am grateful! We had only the necessary repairs done, without being pushed for anything further.\nAs another reviewer posted, the promised times are way off. It took quite a few calls and an entire day to finally get my car done.\nI've had tires and oil changes done here too, and they are always courteous.\nIf you need to wait while your car is worked on, they have a little seating area, with free coffee and a small tv set;more than adequate."

The last time I was there,  I had an appointment at 1:00 and wasn't seen until 1:40pm!  When I asked how much longer, the male owner, kept saying, \""few minutes.\""  When I gave him feedback on how it would be really nice if they could be more accurate with how late they are running so people could run to walgreens or come back, he said, \""If you don't like it - go someplace else- we have plenty of business!\""  Since I tip so well, I was shocked at how I was treated.   The fact that my gel polish would ALWAYS come off after only 1 week and the pedicures weren't that great made me wonder why I was even trying to make this nicely located nail salon work for me.  I will never go back!"
3,This place is having an amazing sale.  You buy one frame & the second is a penny!  I go once a year and buy tons of frames - I love the silver one's and they have some pretty cool contemp styles as well.  I give framed pics out as gifts quite a bit - who needs another tie or a sweater?  Everyone loves a nice pic!\n\nAnd since I go there a lot I know they aren't marking up there prices!  They have a great selection & the people have always been very helpful & nice.  I have also run in there when I need an item to finish up a painting (there paint supplies are a bit pricey) but there frames are great! Don't go during the lunch hour as they share there lot with several popular restaurants!
2,Average location. My order was incorrect as was about 5 out of the next 8 I witnessed.
4,"As a Native Phoenician who now lives out of state I come here every time I visit family and friends.  The merchandising of this business is incredible.  Even if you are not into cigars you will be wowed by the display cases and the way they are laid out.  It is masterful and graduate level stuff.\nThis business is truly a place that backs up what they say on the web site.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and it  comes from example from the top, Mr. Seferian.  He is a cigar afficianado supreme and so courteous.  The selection is second to none and the atmosphere to enjoy your cigar is superb.  As a bonus, most of the people there introduce themselves to you.  Very very friendly.  If I lived in Phoenix, I would be a fixture at this establishment.  It is off the charts.  In terms of doing all the little things that make an establishment a masterpiece, this place has all things covered."
2,"Today, I was rushing from one place to another and needed some fast food.  Not feeling like a burger, I thought that Panda Express sounded convenient.  I was not disappointed though at the same time, the meal was not a gourmet one either.  There was only one person working the register while at the same time serving food so there was a bit of a wait (and the staff member was a bit flustered with much going on at once).  I am guessing that another staff member was on a break as there was a second person there by the time I left.  The restaurant was also kept quite clean though it appeared that the forks and napkins needed some restocking.  \n\nThe food, however, was fresh and as tasty as I had hoped it would be.  I got a two-item combo with fried rice, beef & broccoli, and string bean chicken.  I also added on a chicken egg roll.  The restaurant had several families, a few people on their own, and a couple all also eating, and it appeared that everyone else was also pleased with their meals."
4,i use to go to this place few years ago and then i forgot about it after moving to another city.i just saw it on YELP and i remember their amazing selection.I think it is time for some russian caviar.
0,"I was referred by a friend and have had nothing but trouble with this office.  In November I found out I was pregnant and was having issues before my first appt; I had an emergency and had to get in right away and ended up seeing another doc.  I won't give names, but that doctor basically beat around the bush to tell me I was miscarrying instead of telling me flat out.  My husband literally played 20 questions with that doc to get a simple answer.  It was ridiculous.  Also in Novemeber I had the office call me on two different ocassions to reschedule because they made a \""scheduling error\"".  As far as I'm concerned thats something they should fix since people take time off to make appts in the first place.  Fast forward to today, another emergncy appt and I just got a phone call from them that they canceled my appt. I am so furious with the way that they run this office.  Try and make your schedule work, don't cancel people.  I'm livid and would not return here if you paid me to!"
0,"I wish I could give less than one star. There is no communication between the staff, their attitudes are poor at best, their reception is sloppy and they are commonly overbooked, and they frequently change insurance policies without contacting their patients about having to find a new office. I have never been so disgruntled with an office experience in my life and I would highly recommend finding absolutely anywhere else to take your business."
4,"My husband and I have been patients of Dr A. Katz for 14 years. He always treats us well, never makes us wait long to see him and listens. He has a good bedside manner and is extremely intelligent. We have always been pleased with his front office staff, RN's and NP's. Now that he's got a new location at Thompson Peak Parkway he is closer to our house. Dr Katz is just good people and a great doc."
3,"A nice Whole Foods, to be sure, but considering the Fry's right down the street has great produce at better prices I'm not really sure what would send me to Whole Foods aside from perhaps a search for something esoteric.  Not really much different from the Whole Foods back home in Ohio I'll still be here anytime I need bulk fleur de sel or perhaps quality coffee in a pinch, but otherwise I just can't justify the admission price."
3,"I like this little store. It's nothing compared to the giant store in north Scottsdale. However, I like shopping here because it's a little bit less crazy most of the time. They don't carry all the stuff (and no food court or bar-haha) that the other store has, but they still have most of the good stuff. I usually go there after shopping at Trader Joe's!"
3,"My 2yr old daughter loves this place. We've been twice now, and she can keep herself busy for quite a long time...a plus when you also have a fussy infant to deal with! \nThe little buildings are cute and there are lots of things to play with in each one. My daughter especially likes the school, grocery and doctor's office. \nThere's a slide as well, which seems popular, and a baby corner. There's also a little cafe area, which I didn't expect.  Looks like things are pretty decently priced unless you want a sandwich. Snacks and drinks seem reasonable. I didn't look at everything, and we didn't eat there. \n\nI will say it could maybe use more lighting? Or something? It just seems a little under lit. But like I said, my daughter loves it."
1,Saturday night. Looking forward to this show and we got here before 8pm. Show started near 930. So freaking crowded you can't see the band.  Its so loud you cant hear the band.  Fire Marshall bill would close the place. So over capacity you can't move. Let alone get to the bathroom. All about greed. Need to stop ticket sales while there is still room to move.
0,"I saw Courtney this afternoon for botox.  I've been getting botox on a regular basis for about 10 years & have never had an experience like this.  The ENTIRE appointment lasted about 6 minutes!  With the proper consultation, botox appointments typically last about 30 minutes.  \n1.) She did not discuss ANYTHING with me (other than to not exercise for 4 hours after the treatment)\n2.) She did not have me make facial expressions to determine where to put the product (EVERY Dr./nurse makes you do this, EVERY time)\n3.) She did not ask me one single question about what my concerns were\nShe basically came in, plunged the botox into my face, and said \""ok, you're all set\"".  I was shocked and literally speechless & will never step foot into this establishment again."
0,"I cannot begin to express how poorly I think of Corporate Office Centers. As the reviewer before me stated, the location is ideal and the offices are lovely, but the customer service is atrocious. I had a one-year lease in the office with a number of challenges throughout my term. Unfortunately, my requests for assistance fell on deaf ears. The staff is trained to make money, NOT to help tenants. Below are some examples:\n\nShortly after I moved into the office, I was told that I could not use my AirPort to connect my Mac to my printer and make a wireless environment. That meant that I had to run wires across the office and inconvenience my clients when they visited the office. Apparently, had I paid an additional fee, I could have used my AirPort, which is NOT a router, as specified in my contract and verbally.\n\nThen, when faced with personal and professional financial challenges, I approached the management about moving to a virtual office or finding another solution so I would not have to endure continued financial hardship. Again, I was flatly denied the option to even discuss the situation. \n\nFinally, after ending my lease, I was BILLED! The management requires a substantial deposit, yet I was billed for mail forwarding and cleaning. I had less than $3 worth of mail forwarded to me because I picked up the other pieces. I also never used or publicized the number provided by Corporate Office Centers, as I just forwarded my own number. Therefore, my COC number was not used, even though I still received a $375 fee. And cleaning a 125-square-foot office for $325? I have had my entire 1,300-square-foot home professionally cleaned for little more than that. That amount is ridiculous, especially since I cleaned all surfaces before vacating.\n\nI will vehemently discourage others from using Corporate Office Centers as they are a complete rip-off. I have heard this tale of woe from others who were lured in and are now stuck. If you need an office space, do yourself a favor and avoid COC. It will only cost you if you go this route."
3,"I stopped by Federico's for a quick bite to eat.  I ordered two beef tacos with a drink.  The woman at the counter was doing double duty at the drive-through so service was a bit slow, but the food was excellent.  The tacos were tasty, ,the lettuce was very crisp and fresh, and I was totally impressed by the food.  Very very good value for the money."
0,I have gone here a few times in the past because its the only place around. I have since began just ordering online. The customer service here is terrible and they make you feel really stupid. Avoid it if you can.
2,"Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review for a Pizza Hut. Or even check in on Yelp. Some secrets are best kept in the family. It's Pizza Hut after all. Everyone knows what they're going to get. \n\nSo what's the motivation this time? I noticed some really bad recent reviews for the carry out location I occasionally use. The workers there, however, are consistently nice and really seem to be trying to do a good job given the limitations that Pizza Hut presents. I just wanted to give them a little \""thumbs up\"". \n\nThree stars, the maximum rating allowed by law for a Pizza Hut."
0,"Used to get their pizza all the time, but its been a few years. Husband and I stopped today for lunch. Halfway thru my 2nd piece, a cockroach runs across our table. It had been in my husbands napkins. We showed the mgr. he said that they had been having problems but had sprayed. Don't think that I will go back. The pizza is good but apparently the old building has issues."
3,"I've been coming here for almost 20 years. I stopped after the first visit, as the place was so smokey. It took me another 5 years before I revisited, and luckily they had become nonsmoking by then. \n\nGood decent food. Great Philly steak sandwiches. The Stromboli is also very nice. Sometimes a wait, maybe 10 minutes at worst. \n\nAlways cute women servers, but service sometimes spotty. I hate that I ask for a minute or two to look at the menu, and then have to wait 10 minutes to order. I wouldn't care if they got rid of female only servers, as long as they were attentive. \n\nThey usually have a good weekly special for $8 or so, with drink. Lots of sports on, if that's your thing."
1,1st day for Cardinal football.  Thought this would be perfect. They raised beer prices by a quarter big deal. But the bad part is no sound for the cardinals game and they kept the juke box going.  We complained about it and they said to bad but the Dallas game that night we could listen to it.  Last year the girls could wear jerseys during football but not this year.  Thanks but no thanks
0,"I will never be back. We went once for dinner upon a friend recommending their cheese steak. We ordered an Italian sub and meatball sub. The waitress brought out the food within 3 minutes of ordering. My sub wasn't even hot which was a deal breaker for me. The Italian that I had a bite of had barely any meat on it. Thank goodness the fries were worthy. To top it off, our check was over $30 which is ridiculous for 2 sub-par subs, fries and 2 Cokes. It was Subway quality IMO. I really wanted to like this place."
4,"Glad to see so many people feel the same about Dr. Larson. My husband and I have been going to him for years, for regular \""maintenance\""."
1,"Dude, did you really turn to a co-worker and say, \""you take this order, I don't have the patience to wait for this\"" while my 9-year-old was trying to tell you what he wanted on his sandwich? There were no other customers in the store at the time other than me and my children, so I'm not sure if you just woke up on the wrong side of the bed, or if you somehow mistakenly think that your job doesn't involve serving people no matter how long it takes to place the order.\n\nMajor customer service fail."
3,I'm told this is one of the nicest Food City locations.  Where else can you get a bag of pastillera for a few dollars?  Instead of several dollars each at AJ's.  Love the selection of mexican food stuffs.  $15 Jimador  with a nice glass was a nice bonus find.
4,"WOW wow WOWwwwww! At first I expected this place to be a grocery store and was a little disappointed at first, but man was I in for a pleasant surprise. This place actually has books! Tons of them! I'm from Bosnia and wasn't familiar with the whole library/rent a book concept and at first I was offended that they wouldn't  take cash for the books I had chosen! I fought a bit ....especially when the worker said to bring them back in 3 weeks! However we worked things out! It's an amazing concept! You get to read a book for free and then take it back and choose a new book! America is so great"
2,"Went here with an empty stomach but armed with a coupon, because that's how we roll! *ka-ching*\n\n'They say there's no such thing as free lunch' - Well, they've probably never used a coupon. We got the buy one lunch entree with beverage, and get another lunch entree for free!\n\nMy husband ordered the Chicken Parmigiana.\nVerdict: \""It's okay but it's not gonna win any awards.\""\n\nI got the Spaghetti with meatballs.\nVerdict: It looks like someone threw up blood on Kermit The Frog's face (see pic). It's okay, but I won't nominate it.\n\nService: The waitstaff's friendly but we got there early so we didn't really need to scream for attention like a spoiled 5 year old kid.\n\nAnyway, we heard their pizza's great so we'll probably be back to try them (with a coupon, of course). :p"
0,"Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding."
1,"I went here the other day to help my friend find a wedding dress. When we first got there we checked in and then were told that our helper (can't remember her name) was finishing up with some other clients and to take a look around. We were told to flip the dresses that we wanted outward instead of taking them out ourselves. We walked around for nearly 15 minutes after the appointment was booked.\n\nFinally the helper came over...but by this time someone had put some of the dresses back to normal because obviously on a Sunday we weren't the only ladies there. So that was frustrating. \n\nNext, it turned out they had barely any dresses in her size - what kind of bridal store doesn't carry a good range of dress sizes (she is not unsually small or large)? I surely didn't expect that. She pulled one dress for my friend to try on...which she ended up not liking (not their fault, of course).\n\nThen our helper dissapeared for 20 minutes. Because she had only pulled one dress we were just standing around. She had, I believe, more than 2 brides booked, which is silly because this is for their special day, you should make your customers feel good and that you appreciate them. I finally had to go tell a manager because I couldn't even find the helper in the store. \n\nThe good thing here is that the manager came over herself, with the helper, and helped to pull dresses - THIS is why they get 2 stars instead of 1 because at least she tried to help the situation and listened to my concerns. \n\nHowever, even despite my friend showing her photos of what she was interested in (the poufy type fairy tale dress that is very common) she kept pulling dresses that were SO OFF of what she wanted. She didn't make the bride or any of the rest of us feel good about shopping there at all.  They also kept showing her dresses WAY above her budget!\n\nSo we left feeling completely unsatisfied. It was nice that the manager tried to fix the situation but it still didn't help. \n\nWe ended up at Adore Bridal boutique, where the consigned dresses are listed by size and she found the perfect dress."
0,"I am really disappointed with the service and experience I had with this David's Bridal. Today I went in for shoes for my bridesmaids and the help I received was interrupted and just bad. They only had 3 of the 7 sizes I needed and when I asked questions regarding ordering them, their future shipments, etc. I got \""unsure answers\"". I was frustrated but understood them not having all the sizes I needed. When I pressed for how I was going to obtain them, she never offered helpful information. It was only after I asked do other stores ship them to your location? No. Are you getting more in? Not sure. If other stores have them and I cannot drive there is there an option? It will be $15 to get them shipped per shoe/store. This was not great information or service. She gave me a list of a few locations that had some of the sizes but did not offer to call them to confirm. I left feeling unimpressed.\n\nLater, I called the stores she gave me and 2 of them did not have the sizes in stock that I was told. Now, I work in retail so I know your onhands can sometimes be off, but this disappointment could have been halted if she would have called to verify herself. I finally got a very helpful, friendly associate at the Avondale location (Jessica) and she did not have the shoes either (like the first associate said again) but she gave me options right away. She confirmed that she could ORDER the shoes and get them shipped to my closest location or to my house. An option I never heard from the Tatum location! I was happy to do this, and I even paid the one time $15 dollar fee to get them shipped to my house to avoid going back to the Tatum location and dealing with that horrible service. When Jessica was processing my order, she even made a remark that they didn't fill out any of my information correctly in the system and had to do a whole profile with me over the phone; even though I had been to the Tatum location twice (and purchased items both times). \n\nI wasn't going to put the employees name that helped me because I did not want to be rude, but please ensure management revisits training and what great service looks like with the employees working today, Saturday. I am not looking forward to picking up the shoes I already ordered... I hope I have a better experience then."
4,"Wow! So since we were on a budget we decided to go to the warehouse. I made an appointment 4 days before we would be there (coming up from prescott)  and was able to get in no problem. When I got there I was immediately greeted and met with my consultant Rhonda. Oh Rhonda! She took everything I said into consideration! I was set on the trumpet style dress, but was open to other styles. Rhonda ran around the store twice pulling dresses within our budget! I found my dress in our first round! I did try on 5 total, each with great merits and parts I had told her I wanted. But #3 was the one I fell in love with. Rhonda also helped alot as far as veils and tiaras went, bringing the whole experience into all that it would be on my wedding day! I met with a store manager as well (Erica I believe?) Who was extremely nice and offered any help she could provide. All in all the experience was more than I could hope for, and am so grateful for Rhonda helping me through one of the most taunting tasks of my wedding haha."
4,"Today was my first visit to Gab's I picked them after reading some Yelp reviews. I took my 2008 XTerra to Gab's to check the charging system after the quick-oil-change place on Bell Road told me it was failing. I called ahead, the receptionist was extremely friendly and said I could come down for a quick diagnostic test to see what's what. So I drove right down there. My first impression of this shop was off the charts great. The waiting room is bright, clean and spacious. The check-in was quick and painless. There's free WiFi with the secret code. Ask the receptionist. I barely had time to settle into a chair with my coffee when the technician came back with the results. The alternator was good but the battery was failing. Then came the best news you can hear from your mechanic: There's no charge today. Wait, that's my bad ear, did you say no charge? Yep, no charge for the diagnostic test and no unnecessary repairs suggested or completed. I' moved from know to like to trust in just one visit! Gab's is now my go-to auto mechanic for future needs. Thanks Gab's! I'll be back."
0,The last tome I was in I was waiting for my motorcycle to be finished woth service next door. The wings tastes awful and the fries were clearly frozen store bought. The place still smelled like rotten feet. Later that night I got terribly sick and had diarreah for hours. Clearly the chicken had turned. Will not go back! Truly awful!
0,"i'm not sure if this is the walmart branch, but it doesn't matter.  i moved her and opened an account at walmart (which i absolutely despise), but it was close and i don't know the area.  i came here with a cashier's check from my other bank. so for 10 business days i had no money.  so i called a day earlier so i can buy some food and the girl asks the supervisor that if i have proof that the check has cleared then i could access the money. so after some calls i get the proof and when i call back they tell me i can only have a portion of the money. even though it has cleared, i can't even touch my own money.  what bullshit!!!!!!!!!!  because i was new.  who fucking cares if i am new.  if i have money that the check has cleared, then i should be able to use MY money.  total bullshit.  also, when you call each person tells you different information.  i don't think the left hand knows what the right hand is doing in this place.  i plan on finding another institute and will make them give me all cash so this shit does not happen again."
2,"Not bad if you run in a get out in a hurry. Just has a weird vibe. It is in a nice area, but has a ghetto feel to it. I also prefer the superstores to the general stores. I don't usually shop here unless it is to fix a pair of glasses or grab a couple of items if I am in the immediate location."
4,Went in after a shift at work and was starving. I just had a baby 11 weeks ago so I'm trying to watch what I eat. They have new flavors of sauces that Louis showed me and samples me on. So I ordered the all white meat chicken with brown rice and veggies. I asked for extra broccoli and less rice. Louis took the time to show me if it was enough rice and veggies or sauce. You can tell you have some one working for you that cares about the customer. Thanks Louis
0,"I have to agree with the 2 guys that gave this place 1 star. The people are pretty cool that I've met while staying here but that is the only good thing I can say about this place. We stayed here because it is close to our house that is being remodeled. The management is horrible they will never take ANY responsibility if something happens! We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay. We bought the wifi that the complex offers but the signal is so bad we ended up getting a refund. I have lived in rough places but this was by far worse than living in the projects. Please think twice about renting from this place save yourself some headaches and look elsewhere."
3,Helpful staff! This is what I like to see!!! Love the selection and the staff was very great in helping me and my Auntie find what we needed :D
1,"very poor customer service, i am only going to arrowhead Buckle from now on!! completely ignored at pv and there selection was poor."
4,"Have been looking for a good deli around the office for quite some time now, decided to let Yelp help me and low and behold this is what I found. This is the real deal, freshly prepared sandwiches that are too die for! Plus a variety of fresh sausages, meats etc. Will be making this a once a week lunch run for sure! Try the #14!"
4,"Man, this place is just good.  I don't know if it's a European, American or Polish deli, but the sandwiches are damn good.  Hell it could be called Best of Antarctica Meats & Deli and they would still have some of the best sandwiches in town.  When you buy a sandwich, you actually get two, so keep that in mind.  The sourdough bread is amazing.  The cold cuts are very high quality and delicious.  I purchased a few Polish sausages to go and made them at home later.  Wow.  Impressed."
0,"I'm seriously so over sprint. Spotty coverage, half the time my apps don't work because of low coverage... dropping calls, etc. Not to mention messing up payments and bills.\n\nTonight, however, I'm livid. My iphone died and I plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes. No luck. I tried two other chargers and still nothing worked. So I took it in to the store.\n\nSome employee with blondeish hair and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted annoyed he even had to help me. I explained my problem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but \""if its anything more than that, youre gonna have to wait\"" Ummmm ok, rude.\n\nHe told me it was working fine and that I could just buy another charger if I wanted. No, I'd rather not waste my money. I got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now, and it's still dead.\n\nSprint might want to have knowledgible employees when it comes to Apple if they're going to be dealing with iPhones. Guess I'll head over to the Apple Store for help tomorrow. Sprint and their employees are useless."
2,Sabas Mediterranean is a great little restaurant for date night or family night. The staff is always friendly and can answer any question you might have. \n\nThey also have a great $5 gyro happy hour! Which is an awesome deal because the gyros are very tasteful.  I also really like the falafel.
2,"Stopped for a quick gyro to go, not bad but the cucumber sauce had overpowering garlic added, very bitter and bad taste left in my mouth for hours!\n\nGirl at the register was stunningly beautiful, will return for another try!"
3,"Everytime I go to this places I am surprised.  I just expect it to be bad but the food is actually really good. I have had a salad, a sandwich, and a melt. All were good good. : ) The service is always friendly to boot."
1,"My wife, son and I have been going to Casey Jones now for quite some time, however this most recent time we went the quality of everything kinda seemed to jump off a steep cliff.   We went in with some friends the other night and ordered some of their newest burger the \""Juicy Lucy\"", after ordering them medium, we were rewarded with two burgers that not only seemed to be bleeding but the cheese the oozed out of them reminded me of a horror flick where the guy gets stabbed and his guts just pour out.   After taking the burgers back to the kitchen and being assured the would be taken care of, the burgers deffinately came back cooked... almost with a propane torch, talk about hockey pucks! and to top it off we didn't even get cheese in the new burgers making them not so.. Juicy ya know.   Where as before I would have preached this place to others, I can honestly say we won't be making a return trip until they get a better cook in the kitchen, didn't think it was possible to botch a burger, let alone four! this place has astounded me in the wrong direction =/"
0,"As a diehard Packer fan living in Phoenix, I have been going to Casey Jones' for 4 seasons almost every Sunday.  Each year has progressively gotten worse than the last.  Service is appalling, food quality is dirt poor (except for the wings), everything is filthy, and the hospitality, overall, is terrible.  A week ago I went in; it started the season off on a bad note... I even called the manager over to explain that I am a loyal customer and hadn't seen it this bad EVER.  He didn't have much to say as I gave him some gentle feedback on my experiences, he didn't even apologize or thank me for my loyal business.  I pledged to myself I will never drop another nickel in that place again after that.  Not even for a DIE HARD Packer fan..."
0,"I have a misleading cited to shop at best buy again. I bought my laptop there in December, after an update it stopped working. Spent hours on the phone with the manufacturer who told me Best Buy would cover this they didn't care to even look at the computer. Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service."
3,"I had never been to a Ruby Tuesday's outside of Flagstaff Mall and was never impressed with that one.  We ended up here because it appears to be the only actual restaurant inside PV Mall, and it was too hot to walk across the street.\n\nNow, I don't know if the menus vary by restaurants, but this one had a completely different menu than the restaurant in Flag.  Much smaller and much better.  I had an avocado quesadilla.  Now you may think it would be hard to screw that up, but I was prepared for some green crap mildly resembling avocado, but it was actually the real thing.  My husband had the chicken pot pie.  That looked yummy-it was in a bowl of puffed pastry.  He was pleased.  Great salad bar, too.\n\nWhat stood out was the service.  Excellent.  Would definitely come here again, but probably would still shy away from the chain otherwise."
2,"We ate at the bar. My steak was cooked exactly medium rare but over seasoned. It had so much pepper on it that it made me cough...and I love spicy food. I was with a party of 5 but they only brought one loaf of bread; we had to ask for more. The bartender was friendly, but our server was an apparition."
1,"Perhaps certain places don't deserve the lowest rating because the person doing the reviewing is not a good fit for that particular kind of place, and so, cannot review it accurately. Because of this, I gave this place an extra star just in case I am biased against these types of places.\n\nNow I will paint humanity with a wide brush and put us all into two camps: \n\n1) Those who would rather play with a dog outside on the lawn on a nice warm afternoon.\n\n2) Those of us who would rather slip outside the backdoor of a rock club in Berlin to snort a quick line.\n\nLet me just say that in my camp we have no use for, nor desire to ever return to, this Outback Steakhouse type of establishment.\n\nWhat I truly think about this place is not suitable for public utterance, but I will go so far as to say the food was dull, the drinks were mixed as if they were for a teething child and not a grown man, and the atmosphere looked as if the decorator was commissioned from the school of bathroom design.\n\nIf you died and went to this place, you would not be in hell, but you would not be very happy."
0,"First time here.  It's too bad the food is pretty good because the service is horrible. It wasn't busy and the cashier girl gave us such an attitude as we were trying to decide which bread we wanted (it only took us 2 seconds max).  Food took awhile which is fine because you can't rush good food, right?  Well, then the cashier girl forgot one of our items, made me wait while she helped more customers that walked in after I waited in line to get the item, gave me more attitude when I asked her for it and the gave me the greasiest looking soup imaginable.  It's too bad the other food items in our order are pretty good because we won't be back."
1,"Asthma and respiratory sufferers avoid this place like the plague.  It stinks to high heaven of cheap teen cologne.  The merchandise is still over priced and staff is dumber than a box of rocks.  On the plus side, it's a great place for decent men's sweat pants.  Just make sure you don't pay full price.  Also wash the clothes when you get them home,  they will stink like their cologne."
2,"I know what you are thinking... why is this girl reviewing another Sports Authority?!  Well, I drive by this SA location all of the time and every now and then I pop in if I have some time to spare.  After all, I'm always in the market for a new workout outfit to motivate me to get to the gym!\n\nI recommend going to this or any SA location when in need of sports apparel, shoes, or equipment.  The selection is decent, sale racks can be great, and regular pricing is on par with most other places too...\n\nFor any girls that like the color PINK or are training for one of the many walks to find a cure for breast cancer, the selection of PINK apparel is pretty good right now and they have some really cute stuff to choose from in Nike, Addidas, Puma, Champion, Under Armour, and more!\n\nParking at this location is easy as it's a shopping center with plenty of spots to choose from."
0,Was there awhile back. Food was just average. However the reason for my 1star review-   On my way out i ordered a piece of chocolate cream pie to take out.   When I got home I opened the box and inside was a dried up piece of pie.   Literally.  I put my fork into the whipped cream and the entire whipped cream came off in one piece.  Underneath the chocolate was dried and cracked.  It was the consistency  of something that sat for 2 weeks in an arid place.   Im not making this up.  The pie had to have been a couple of weeks old.  What bothered me though was that waitress HAD to have known the pie was old.  The staff HAD to have passed it several times over the weeks.  I was floored.  I threw it out cause it was too late to drive back there.  Da did they think I wouldn't notice!  Will never go back there because that wasn't just a mistake.   They didn't want to loose money so they sold me it to instead. And they are famous for their pies.   What a laugh
3,"Very good quality / price ratio. Warm and friendly welcome, good effort to understand my broken English. Well located, very good comfort room and spacious. The restaurant on the 27 th floor very well. At recomander."
1,"I went to a late lunch here today.  Great food and great carhops!  A reasonable value and quick service.  Unfortunately, it all comes with a large helping of rudeness from the person taking the orders.  You never see the person who takes your order which is a major weakness in their system.   Today that anonymity was taken advantage of by someone who decided to be abrasive and condenscending  So if you are really hungry and want a side order of crappy attitude and abuse with your lunch, this is the place for you. Personally, I'm going to give it some time because no business can succeed with an employee acting like this."
1,"Wish I'd read these reviews before I went there, but I was getting my phone fixed down the street, and decided a quick car wash would help kill the time. The previous reviewers are right on the money when it comes to the ol' up-sell. You would think with all these reviews saying the same thing it would be looked into, and trust me, I understand the value of a good up-sell...but THREE times with THREE separate people? It's a little much. Plus, if I come in there initially inquiring over the $4.99 price and asking if there is anything lower than the $32 price (which to be fair, yes, there is) what in the world makes you think I am going to want to spend upwards of 60 dollars? Honestly. And it shouldn't take me 10 minutes to convey to you that I really am not concerned with my windshield right now...that's right, I'm gonna take a gamble on that one, I live on the edge like that....\n\nYou did do a pretty good job cleaning the car, but leaving a car wash of all places feeling frazzled is not my thing. Not to mention, I fell for the $4 \""Supreme Upgrade\"" and you forgot my vanilla air freshener. Dang it. Had no idea what kind of negotiation would occur if I went back, so I will look at it as a lesson learned and go on with my life....:)"
4,"The most outstanding customer service and extremely efficient wash, details, and oil changes! Anything and everything I need exceeds more than my expectations. I go to this wash at least two times a week and I leave happy every time!"
1,"I've been going to Classic Barbers since 2003, now with over 40 visits documented in my home accounting program.  Like others, I've been served by all of their barbers and have been fully satisfied with their services.  However, I am not going back.  They've instituted a new policy by charging extra for payment by credit card .  I'm sure they have their reasons.  I hope their reasons outweight the downside of losing loyal customers."
0,"So, I just moved in the area and was looking for a new place to get my hair cut. I gave this place a call and politely introduced myself and asked the woman on the phone whether they did only appointments or walk-ins today. She interrupted me mid-question and answered in a tone acting as if I was some kind of annoying pest. I ignore it and ask their approximate wait time and she laughs at me, says \""ugh.. just come in!\"" *click* Yes, she hung up on me. The phone call lasted all of 20 seconds.\n\nI immediately called a different barber shop and took my business to somewhere else. As a suggestion to whoever manages this place, please train the bitter, angry woman who answers your phone to have some basic courtesy because you just lost a potential twice-a-month loyal customer."
3,"Just moved back to Phoenix and decided to check this place out. Peter cut my hair and did an excellent job. I also got a neck shave followed by a surprise neck and head massage. Total came out to $21 bucks, which I thought was a great deal. I'll be back to see Peter again."
2,We had been told by a few people to go here and get our mattresses. I had called the store and had gotten a quote for a set and then sent my husband in to look at it. A couple weeks went by and a living social deal popped up $39 for a $200 voucher.  It sounded to good to be true-right? Well it was! I purchased the voucher and headed over a couple days later to get a bed.  When I got there the sales guy told me that he already reduced all the beds $200 ( voucher-can't be used with any other sales) and that basically the living social deal is no good. Hmmmm that sounded a little unethical to me. He basically went into a contract with living social and then turned around and said he reduced everything so therefore the voucher is void! The funny thing is he quoted me prices weeks before the living social deal and had NOT changed his pricing from then????\nDon't get me wrong his prices are decent I just wasn't impressed on the fact that he did the living social deal just to get people in the door.  I went home and contacted living social and they refunded my $$$ and said that if this is what he did then he broke his contract with them and these are not the businesses they want to work with.  Again decent prices just didn't like how this deal was handled.
4,"Great service every time. Always seem to have what we need. Today I took in 5 watches. Normally I go to another place for watch batteries that might be a little cheaper, but lately I was having trouble getting there before closing time. This place is open til 8pm on weekdays and 7pm on Saturdays!  Even 10-5pm on Sundays!!  This is great news."
1,"They do have just about any kind or type of battery. My issue is with the website. After looking up the battery you need, then you select the store nearest you and check stock. Then you arrive there to purchase the battery and they tell you they DO NOT HONOR THE INTERNET PRICES. When the internet site directs you to a store they should honor the price."
3,"Love this Jamba Juice.  The bo-go coupons come through so often that it makes it tough to go there without one.  I have to modify my order to make it dairy.  Pet peeve- it's \""sherbet\"", not \""sher-beRt\"".  There is no second \""r\"".  If you're in the smoothie biz, please say it right."
4,"THE BEST DIVE BAR I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!\n\nI used to live off of Bell Rd. and Tatum Blvd. This place wasn't that far from where I used to live. I used to come in every Friday and Saturday nights. \n\nGreat place, the karaoke is great (I sang there a few times myself), and the drinks are reasonably priced. \n\nSince I moved in 2004, I have only visited it about 3 times since. And the last 3 times were all new people and new bartenders. So I didn't know anyone anymore. The last time I had been in was last year in 2010. I still liked it and only 1 person remembered me. But I still liked it, lol!"
1,"I used to love this place back in high school, so I decided to drop in for a delicious protein smoothie. \nI ordered a medium high protein smoothie, and was absolutely salivating over the upcoming flavor as I hadn't eaten all day.\n\n Well my first disappointment came with the price, a whopping $10.00 for a d*mn medium smoothie! Holy cow! What are they adding to this to make it so god-like you ask? I have no idea, my only add on was friggin peanut butter, which was only a small dollop. \n\nMy second complaint was the service, although it wasn't awful, it certainly didn't entice me to ever want to return. \n\nI think I will stick with One Stop Nutrition, I can get the same exact smoothie, with peanut butter, for $5.00. \n\nI'm not trying to bring the gavel down on this place, but they certainly need to double check their prices, I definitely don't taste the quality or see the justification in charging an arm and a leg."
2,"A-OK sounds right.  We all wanted some Italian for our family fun night dinner, and we were kinda on our way to that side of town (half way on the way, jump street on 59th and bell) so I figured whats a little further gonna hurt if we go somewhere that is suppose to be pretty good.  Yelp says its good for kids, but we felt like maybe that isn't exactly correct when we walked in, there were no other kids at all.  I try to teach the kids that nude art is not wrong, but they were still caught off guard, so the statue and paintings made them feel like it was not for kids either.  Overall there was a strong feeling of eyes looking at the table with the kids...I could have been feeling self conscious, but it wasn't all in my head.  I  went into an \""oh well, its no biggy\"" mode just so we could eat and move on with our night.  We had driven over an hour to get there, so we were starving and not willing to hunt something else down.  \n\nOur waiter was nice, but was also busy with a big party, so our service took a lot longer, but that is totally fine and understandable.  The bread and butter was very good, it made me excited for the meal to come.  I ordered chicken Parmesan, the Hubby and oldest ordered Chicken Fettucini Alfredo, and the youngest ordered lasagna.  Overall the food was OK.  It wasn't bad. The marinara is good, so my parm was good. The kids gobbled their food up. It was not wonderful, amazing, great, it was good. \n\nEven if it were not so far, I can't say I would be back again.  I think we could have had a little better food right here at Babbo."
1,"So we got duped by all the rave reviews for this restaurant. First we get escorted to a tiny little table that was practically like sitting with the people at the next table. We asked to sit at the many empty tables for four. Were told no as they all had reservations. The waiter must have noticed the perplexed expression on my face because he came back after we sat and told us that a reservation had cancelled and offered us one of those tables...So points for that...Side note, all those tables were empty for the entire time we were there.\n\nI ordered the Chicken with prosciutto...I promise you that what I got was chicken with some sort of thick slab of very salty pork product that was not prosciutto, accompanied by the limpest over done pasta I've ever had..The noodles broke in the fork because they were so water logged and soggy. Also served with a basic marinara sauce that in no way complimented the lemon wine sauce on the chicken. My husband ordered the special..seafood risotto. Plenty of seafood, but we're still trying to decide if it was really risotto or some undercooked rice..There was none of the creaminess associated with well prepared risotto.\n\nAfter that we decided to go for broke and order the tiramisu..You can get better at your basic supermarket bakery.\n\nThe service was very good as the waiter and busser were very attentive.."
3,"Great Salsa!\n\nWhile driving down Cactus we had a sudden craving for Mexican food and stopped at the first place we found. \n\nWe were seated immediately and had wonderful service, I saved the receipt so I could remember to put her name in my review but I can't find it. Once I do...I'll let ya know!\n\nWe had a slew of folks that helped bring drinks, chips, salsa and everything else that we needed. I was pretty impressed with the level of service we received. \n\nThe ONLY downfall is not having an Italian dressing that's not creamy. No one likes creamy dressing. Please get a true vinaigrette  on your menu. I loved your taco salad but didn't have a good dressing to put on it. I promise to add this to my roatation if you do."
1,"i really hate to do this, but i have to. service was slower than slow. my bagel + cream cheese was super skimpy on the cream cheese. turkey chili was lukewarm and not as good as it should have been. the staff seemed gloomy and sad. it just wasn't a good experience. it really is too bad, i haven't had lunch at a einstein's in forever and i was hoping it would be as good as i remember it."
0,"2/2/11- Talk about going downhill! Dunno know if it is a new mgr or what but when I get a roll with my salad and the bottom half is covered in black mold...EEK! \n\nThis little stuck-in-the-seventies place is the restaurant at the Belair Golf Course off of Bell Rd. Its really somewhat of a hidden gem though if you're looking for regular ol' American food. Its quiet, has a lovely view of the lake, peaceful, good service and above average food. The breakfast is especially good with the chicken fried steak being my personal favorite. Its actually real steak not some pre-breaded b.s. I like the club sandwich for lunch- generous amounts of meat, fresh lettuce & tomato, hot fries- how can you go wrong? My only reason for not giving it another star would be the decor. Its perfectly fine, I guess. It's clean. Its just so seventies. But, hey, go there to relax with friends, get a drink from the bar and soak up the seventies charm."
4,"Mango Habanero tacos. Amazing. The employees here saw that we were hungry, and they were slammed. I was so elated when they swung by and gave my boyfriend and I a total of 4 free meal coupons out of a thank you. A little patience goes a long way, and so does gratitude for your customers. Best Rubio's ever! :)"
0,Never eat here. They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up.
1,"First off let me say that up until tonight I was a huge fan of Rubios. I would always order their grilled shrimp tacos or bean and cheese burrito. It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.\n\nOn a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's. They have two strikes against them in my book."
2,"I graduated from PVHS in 1976, the Bicentennial year! Moved to Phoenix (and into PVHS) near the end of my sophomore year, 1974. By comparison, the high school I left (in Wisconsin) and the school I came to (PV) were opposite ends of a coin.\n\n1. There aren't any cowboys in Wisconsin. In contrast, I got to describing PV as \""6,000 cowboys and the Drama Club.\"" And I wasn't far off. \n2. None of the required reading in my high school in Wisconsin (Slaughterhouse 5 by Vonnegut and Siddhartha by Hesse, for example) we even AVAILABLE in the PV library. I remember asking about those titles and the librarian called them \""smut\"" and seemed offended that I would ask. (If found out that if you wanted to read those books you had to take classes from Mrs. Alderman, who was the best English teacher EVER. She just passed in 2011 at age 97. )\n3. The quality of education in Wisconsin, on a scale of 1-10, was 12. Here, they were happy to teach at a level of about 6. \n4. Smoking at both high schools was not allowed but people did it anyway. Smokeless tobacco though? In Wisconsin nobody'd even HEARD of it. Out here, it was Cowboy Candy! Guys were spittin' that shit all over campus.\n5. You could bring a knife to school and wear it on your belt and nobody cared. In Wisconsin, nobody even thought about doing that.\n6. By coming to PV I managed to get through high school without ever writing a \""term paper,\"" because none of my teachers ever asked for them. In Wisconsin I couldn't have avoided it.\n7. The study hall was a great advancement out here, compared to the cafeteria used in Wisconsin. PV's study hall was a separate building with a very small room you could actually study in. The rest of the building was filled with air hockey machines, pool tables, a snack bar and a stereo playing whatever albums kids brought in to play. \n8. I will say that the English department down here had it all over my Wisconsin HS, because you could take classes based on types of literature. I took Science Fiction, Humor in Literature and other interesting classes.\n9. In Wisconsin,the drinking age was 18, which means seniors and teachers frequently socialized at the same bars. This led to odd situations, to be sure, but nobody went to jail for it. In AZ at that time drinking age was 19. That didn't keep the occasional teacher and student from commingling, but nobody cared. It was a different time."
0,"How on gods green earth does this place have 5 stars? I had the worse experience today and would never, ever recommend this place to anyone. \n\n1. They had extreme police videos on Spike tv on full blast the whole time. I always bring my kindle to nail salons to read while I get my pedicure and could not concentrate at all because the volume was so loud. \n\nThe women who was doing my mani and gel pedi was way more concerned with the tv than my nails, to the point that she cut me while trimming my cuticles. I had to tell her that I was bleeding before she even noticed, she had literally just been watching the tv for about 30 seconds WHILE USING A SHARP OBJECT ON ME!!! \n\nI dont know about any of you, but when I go to a nail salon I want to relax a little bit, not listen to sirens, gun shots or a narrator talk about how long people will be in prison for trying to kill their husband... maybe I am crazy though? \n\n2. The gel manicure itself was horrible, 4 of my fingers have polish along the back of my nail bed and my pinky does not have any polish along one side. I tried telling the women while was doing the mani, but she just kept shaking her head and say it was fine, I am pretty sure she did not understand me. \n\n3. After she was done, I politely said \""I am very unhappy, this is not the type of manicure I am used to.\"" She said, that she thought that they looked great and acted as though I was crazy. All the workers at this point started talking and the owner came over. She was young, and clearly lacked experience in customer service. She did not offer to fix them and said I had to pay. I gave her my credit card and told her I would never be back. \n\n\nHORRIBLE!!!!!"
0,"Terrible service experience! I went in to buy some tires, so I was waiting at the tire service counter with one person in front of me and another behind me. The advisor who was helping the person in front of me said to me I'll be with you in just a moment sir, at which I nodded and said that's fine. Well after about 10 mins I am still waiting... now the person in front of me is outside the store with the advisor, I am at the counter waiting for help, one person behind me. While I am at tbe counter, another advisor walks up to the person behind me and says how can I help you, and took them to another service counter. The person behind me was foreign, and obviously didn't get that what she was doing was rude behavior, however the Service Advisor should have! I waited 5 more minutes to no avail, I left the store, they lost a sale. Very unprofessional, I will not go here again."
0,This place has completely given up. I don't know if they have had new owners within the last 4 months or so but its gotten really bad. Unless your one of the regulars who have probably been drinking since 11am you don't get much attention here.\n\nJust went there tonight for the 35 cent wings on Monday night. Waited 5 minutes before the lazy waitress decided to come greet me. Placed my order right away as I could tell how often I would see her again. Just got 2 dozen wings. ....... 45MINS LATER my wings show up. Not exaggerating at all. NEWSFLASH- Wings take 8mins in the fryer...why would I have to wait 45mins??? When they finally showed up I let her know Ill just take them to go since Im out of time. She didn't seem to care at all I was clearly upset. Also NOT ONE TIME did she refill my drink...not one time. And to top of the whole fun experience I get the check to find out they have stopped the wings deal on Monday. \n\nIts sad cause I used to go here with all my friends every Monday and this place had good waitresses who cared but like I said earlier these people now don't care one bit. NEVER AGAIN. Thank Jackie for the great experience and hope you can find another dump hole to work in 6 months when this place is closed.

Oh yes, you can ALWAYS say BACON!!!!\nFriendly service, reasonable prices and fresh warm donuts. YUM. \nThis place is my go-to spot for donuts when I'm in the Phx/Scottsdale area. \nHIGHLY recommended. And trust me, I've eaten a TON of donuts."
4,"Ever since we moved into our place a few years back this has been our favorite and only place to go for donuts.  A very popular and renowned donut shop has since been opened in our area, but Rainbow Donuts can't be beat!  After going to the new one once or twice we realized how much better Rainbow Donuts is.  They're always friendly, always delicious, and always a very wide variety of all the flavors you'd expect.  Highly recommended!"
1,"I'm a comics purist. I want to be able to walk into a store and find my comic in pristine condition on the shelf. I want someone to roam the aisles or stack shelves and if I have questions, I want them to enthusiastic and help me. If I spend a lot of money at the counter, i want to be treated like a regular or someone worthy of respect.\n\nInstead, this is my typical experience. I walk in and I see all of  stores employees standing behind the counter and laughing and talking obnoxiously loud with one another.  I don't see anyone looking at comics. The most activity in the store is at the card table. I usually don't find my comic on the shelf because they failed to order enough comics as usual.  I walk up to the counter and wait 3 minutes until the employees finish their conversation with each other.  I ask them about the comic and this is their response: \""Uh..which comic is that, Yeah, sorry I have no idea when they came out. I don't read Marvel or D.C. sorry.  Yeah I don't know if we will get that in. You might want to try one of our other stores dude. Oh hey, we have this sale on Crapola #1\""  After responding no, I'm not interested \""You sure dude, it's a great book and that's a really great price\""\n\nThis is usually what I endure when I walk into Atomic Comics. I went to All About Books and Comics and the employees actually knew which comics arrived this week on the top of their head. They   knew which ones sold out and that was rare because the issue I wanted was usually on the shelf in multitudes. They were in great condition.  They were pretty normal everyday people who read comics as a hobby as opposed to being these weird emos who were more into manga."
0,This company is good at cleaning your pockets and that's it. Terrible experience even after they were sent back to re-clean. This company does business under numerous names so check out the phone  number - buyer definitely BEWARE - awful cleaning service.
0,"I will never shop at Artie's Ace ever again. First, I ask one of their employees for help and his response is \""no English\"". He literally did not speak one word of English. Second, I went to return Christmas lights and after debating amongst themselves whether they accepted returns they tell me it will be a 25% restocking fee. Nowhere on their receipt does it say that. I dispute this unclear policy which they did not like being questioned. Next, the cashier tells me the lights need to be in the box.  Okay I will box them. But wait she says the lights must be tested. Great test them. Nope need to be boxed. Needless to say at this point I am extremely frustrated and getting mad. Finally, their \""manager\"" comes out and he says he has heard enough of me talking to his \""girls\"". What is he their pimp? Btw, he looks like a pimp with his fake tan in the middle of December and bleached hair. We go back and forth which at this point he starts yelling for his employees to call the police because he is kicking me out. His store is by \""invitation\"" only and I am not welcome there. Fine I start walking out and we keep talking outside where he tells I cannot return the lights because I did not put them in the box and that he is not my \""maid\"". He makes more threats about calling the police and taking my license plate number down. Awesome! I ask him for his name. He refuses and asks for my name. I tell him it. I ask again for his name and refuses again. I ask if he is the owner. Nope. Are you the manager? Yes. Awesome! I leave with the lights and will never shop here again. Horrible customer service!"
0,Wasted my time going there at 658pm Friday night when their website said they closed at 8pm.
4,Super friendly and attentive to the small things. Had frames repaired months ago. Went back in because a different screw came loose. The same gentleman replaced it for free and tightened up all the other screws. I know it's a small thing but most places these days would fix what they have to and move on but I really appreciated the little extra time it took to make sure I was taken care of.
2,"Definitely a hole in the wall bar. All the bartenders are nice and they have cheap specials. They have board games (which is unique and fun), darts, and arcade games. Some nights they have live local musicians and they play the games on Sunday. Nothing fancy and very tiny, in fact most of the time you will have to order food out b/c they don't have much. The food they do have fried pickles and iguana balls(chicken balls) are really good. Just kind of boring as far as bars go with crappy country music and usually not a lot of ppl in there."
0,"I went to Ulta in Desert Ridge and was really disppointed.  I came in to get my hair trimmed about forty-five minutes before they closed.  When I came in there were two stylists sitting in the waiting area talking to the receptionist.  They asked if I had an appointment (I didn't) and then told me they couldn't take me so late, which was fine.   Then one of the stylists, an older gentleman, found it necessary to lecture me for a good five minutes on how late it was, which I thought was terribly rude.  It's a shame, because I work and live very close and was hoping to find a good salon in my area."
0,"Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards. \n\nI was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.\n\nI would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.\n\nCheers,\nUntil then, get the beers in...\nJust not at Shogun."
1,"I'm giving this two stars only because our server was great.  We went for happy hour and perhaps that was the problem...the spicy tuna roll wasn't spicy and tasted like they made it yesterday.  The tuna tataki didn't taste fresh and was rather bland.  We tried the inferno roll, but i could barely taste it through all the mayo.  On a positive note, the Godzilla tails were pretty tasty.  Sorry Shogun, you can do better!"
3,"I am sad to see all the negative reviews....though it seems that a good majority is for the sushi, which, I do not eat. \n\nI am pretty much IN LOVE with the Chicken Katsu here. I order it with a side of teriyaki (I like to dip my chicken Katsu in the teriyaki sauce, then the Katsu sauce for a sweet and savory flavor) \n\nThe Tempura is always great, we get a mixed starter. \n\nThe miso is tasty. \n\nI love the little salad they serve with the peanut dressing, its the first thing I eat off my plate. So good! \n\nI didn't give them 5 stars because this last time we went (Tuesday night) our waitress was a total space Cadette. She looked like she was barely old enough to work. Had zero personality. Just wasn't feeling her at all. \n\nOther then that, this is one of my go to spots when I have a deep need for some Chicken Katsu. I have had this dish at other restaurants and none come close to Shoguns."
0,"I am downgrading my last rating of 3 stars.  Some time ago, I stopped going to Shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident.  Time passed, and my husband and I recently decided to give their Happy Hour a try.  We parked the car, walked toward the door, and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds."
0,"Our family has frequented Shogun for years and we are done. The service is awful and the food has gone  downhill. While I hope that their manager Shelly has success turning it around, it is obvious that the owners don't care. Our friends are saying the same thing."
1,"Some friends and I were meeting up for sushi and this place was one of the closest sushi places to their house so we decided to stop by.  It was fairly busy when we showed up but we were seated right away which was nice.  Half of our party (the guys) were going to be showing up a little later but we went ahead and ordered some drinks and appetizers to tide us over until they showed up.  The waitress was nice if somewhat lacking in her knowledge of the menu but we didn't really mind.\n\nAfter getting our appetizers and initial drinks we really didn't see our waitress, well actually let me rephrase that, we saw her at other tables around us just not at ours.  Now, I understand that we had told her we were going to wait to order until our party shows up so it's not like we expected her to show up and take our whole order, but she wasn't even coming around to fill our water glasses or to check and see if we needed refills.\n\nOnce the guys showed up and we ordered the food came out and I was kind of underwhelmed.  None of it was bad but it was all pretty average.  The only thing memorable were the Panko Breaded Onion Rings which were fantastic.  Honestly I would go just for those babies.  As for the sushi I may try a different roll and see if that made a difference and I would definitely hope for a server who's a little more attentive."
2,"Sushi was very good and fresh. The restaurant was very busy, probably due to the $0.25 draft beers on Monday night's. The sushi counter was kinda awkard with high panels."
0,"Visited Coco's on a Monday afternoon (parking lot was \""unusually\"" sparse.. counted 3 cars total.  Seating was quick, order was taken quickly, salads were delivered quickly.  The main entree didn't arrive until 30 minutes later (entire restaurant was empty except maybe 2-3 tables.  Someone must have to slaughter a cow to make 2 cheeseburgers.  My stomach felt upset for about an hour afterwards.. Service was A-ok, waitress had to be reminded to refill the tea, didn't take up completed dishes (manager took some of the dishes and said he be right back to pick up the rest  - - didn't happen.  Waitress was advised to split the checks - - didn't happen, sent her back to make the change.\n\nCoco's gong down the same path as Marie Callendars.."
0,"I was looking forward to coming to this place as it is very close to where I live and we are always looking for a new place to try. The parking lot looked busy but we decided to give it a try and hope that we would get a good breakfast before we started our errands.  WRONG!  We actually didn't even order.  We walked in and instantly noticed how outdated the place was but we were willing to still give it a try.  We stood at the front door, waiting for a hostess but no one came over for a good 3-4 mins.  There seemed to be a decent amount of employees working but no one greeted us or acknowledged us.  A younger girl came over and without even making eye contact, just said in a very low voice, \""hi, how many\"", we asked how long the wait would be and she said about 10 minutes.  Weird thing is, we noticed empty tables and booths all around but didn't want to be a pain and say anything, maybe they were short staffed even though they seem to have quite a bit on staff.... We sat down and we instantly started to notice how disgusting and dirty the place was.  The floors were disgusting and we were able to see the display case for their pies.  The case was nasty.  You could clearly tell the glass was not cleaned inside or outside for quite some time.  The inside of the case where the pies were, you could see food and other things on the bottom.  We both cracked some jokes about how gross the place was and both decided to not wait to eat.  We just got up and walked out.  Do not go here, you will be just as disappointed as us.  We ended up going to the 5 & Diner that is a minute away.  We have been there about 3-4 times and have always received good service."
0,"We did not have a good experience here. The food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low.  The server was slow and when we got the food to go sauce leaked out if the bag creating a massive mess. The containers just weren't able to hold all that bland flavor.\n\nIf a one star rating doesn't tell you to skip it, I don't know what will."
2,"Dillard's is one of my favorite department stores, it really is. And being a man, this is just for the men's section. (That tiny little corner of the store)\n\nThe selection here...is absurd. Styles from 3 seasons ago...Brands like Affliction and Ed Hardy, really?, I mean...REALLY?! (Both of which are brands traditionally worn by douchebag 20 year old men, for those of you who are fashion-challenged ;) )\n\nThe Calvin Klein and Murano booths are smallish, though both can have surprising deals and interesting finds! Compared to the Fashion Square facility, the largest Dillard's in America, this location is depressing. But on a positive note, the men's cologne booth here is fantastic, and the employees here are excellent. At every Dillard's I've been to, the customer service is where they go above and beyond."
0,"I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor."
0,"I have been bowling on a league at this location for 2 years.  They were bought out this last year and it sure went downhill!!!  They are short staffed, never anyone at the food counter.  Plus I saw the person behind the food counter cough directly onto food, which I told the manager.  How disgusting!!  I will NEVER have food there!  The staff just doesn't to care like it used to with the old owners.  Plus now they charge for coffee for league bowlers!  They never used to before.  It's just gone downhill!  If it wasn't for my wonderful team members, I would go to Brunswick!!!"
2,"This Safeway holds a special place in my heart. It is only a block away from my house, the shelves are always stocked and it never seems to be busy.  There is a pharmacy (and they are quick!), meat counter, floral department, bakery and a Starbucks kiosk.  The staff is friendly, though often in no rush to get customers on their way.  There are some great deals to be had here...just don't forget your discount card.  Without it the prices are downright unreasonable, hence, the somewhat sad, three star rating."
2,"Best hot and sour soup I've ever had!\n\nTake out! It's a hole in the wall. Family owned and ran, great people! I've been going here since a kid service and quality are consistent! Make sure you call in your order takes forever but that's how you know it's fresh!"
3,They have really good cheap sandwiches for lunch
1,I had to call 3x  before I got a call back for an estimate.  Still went with the company. Paid 50% and waited 1.5 weeks before I HAD TO CALL to see what the status was...they were done but never called tell me..now let's see how long it takes before they finish the job. Frustrated customer.
4,"I been going to Lims for more than 7 years. Their food is delicious. They have the best fries,orange chicken,rice, crab puffs and chicken wings In town. It's also super affordable and the waitresses are always super nice . I highly recommend to take your family here ."
0,"Disgusting. Typical cheap, dirty, greasy Americanized Chinese food. Clean your damn restrooms! Chicken thigh meat in the chicken and broccoli. Hot and sour was pure barf. Dark."
2,"Wow - a lot of 5 star reviews on the Dragon Palace.  I suspect many are giving heavy handed reviews as this is a \""sentimental\"" favorite.  I guess even my rating is slightly biased that way too.  But 5 stars people?  Meaning it cannot get any better than \""woohoo, as good as it gets\""?  Ok, I'll end my rant and get to the review.\n\nIn short, this is your typical old school Mandarin/Szechuan style chinese restaurant.  Decor is slightly tired, but who really cares about decor anyways for a neighborhood chinese restaurant?\n\nStaff couldn't have been friendlier.  It's family run (from what I gather) and take out service is quick and efficient.  They include almond cookies, sauces, utensils, and fortune cookies in a nice packet with your to go order.  Everything was packaged VERY well.\n\nThe menu is a diverse variety of your typical chinese items.  Be aware that some dishes (like the Moo Goo Gai Pan) have alternate names (like \""Snow White Chicken\"").\n\nStill with me?  Good...on to the food.\n\nI ordered BBQ pork slices, Kung Pao Chicken, and a dish they called \""Bo Bo Shrimp\"".  \n\nThe BBQ pork slices were generally not too fatty as they can be other places, however some pieces were sliced too thin as they were dry.  Also, the seasoning did not permeate the meat that much.  There was also no \""sauce\"" (which is good, because Char Siu should not have any sauce per se).  Maybe I'm just spoiled with good BBQ pork, and I also realize it's just an appetizer, but could have been better and more flavorful.\n\nThe Kung Pao Chicken is very average.  First I'm appreciative of chinese restaurants that use dark meat instead of white as it's not dry.  But add to that a lot of peanuts that were a little overpowering (I felt like an elephant), lots of cubed green pepper and onion, and a lot of sauce made this the typical Kung Pao chicken.  Was it bad?  It wasn't bad, but not 5 stars great either.  I don't know if I really understand why Phoenix area chinese places are compelled to throw a ton of vegetables in Kung Pao.  It'd be nice for once to have a relatively vegetable-less \""meat\"" dish and order vegetables separately (like how you order at better chinese places).  Compared to other places in Phoenix, it was probably better than what I've had, but again, not 5 stars \""amazing\"".\n\nThe Bo Bo shrimp was a breaded shrimp dish with a spicy brown sauce.  On the positive, I tasted the ginger and garlic come out of the sauce, but the breading on the shrimp was so heavy it was falling off as I ate it.  Perhaps it was because it was take out and it got soggy, so I'll reserve some judgement for when I dine in person, but I've had plenty of take out and the shrimp are not always like that.  I would have preferred a lighter coating which can be achieved with a dusting of cornstarch.\n\nI can see why this place has gotten the accolades because relatively speaking, there isn't a lot of good accessible chinese food here in Phoenix (well, unless you go to Cofco Plaza, Lee Lee Market, Great Wall, etc.).  But again, there is much better around.\n\nWith that being said, if you've read my other reviews you'll see I am a big fan of locally run non-chain restaurants.  So don't let my review scare you too much, I'm just picky and have high expectations.  I certainly could have ordered items that are difficult to make poorly (Mushu pork, mongolian beef, etc.) but chose Kung Pao as it's difficult to pull off properly.  So please try this place for yourself and form your own opinion.  At least you have mine."
1,"One step above a hole in the wall buffet place.  Food was edible.  Very bland, service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot.  I'll take my money elsewhere."
1,"I was really looking forward to finding a good Chinese food restaurant, but this was not it. The only reason this gets two, and not one star is because of the reasonable prices. 12.95/person for the Mandarin Family dinner was a good deal. However, the food was flavorless, overcooked, and the atmosphere no better. \n\nThe Wor Won Ton soup was fair. The wontons had almost no meat in them, such little meat that I thought there was nothing there until I took a closer look. \n\nThe egg rolls were overcooked and the filling was not tasty.\n\nThe fried wontons, like the soup, had almost no filling. My daughter said it looked like a tiny booger. She was right.\n\nThe shrimp with lobster sauce was fair, though too salty for my tastes. \n\nThe Sweet and Sour pork - again, overcooked, burned breading on the outside.\n\nThe House Special Chicken was just OK - the sauce was thin, runny, and also overly salty. \n\nI can't believe how many good ratings this restaurant had. I was sorely disappointed."
3,Menu looks like every single chinese takeout place on the east coast and they aren't pretentious.  Clearly I'm not in California anymore.  Fantastic.  This place made me pretty dang happy.\n\nIt's rot gut chinese.  Boom.
0,"Oh for the days when the funny guy with the mustache was making the donuts fresh for us! I had an issue with this location limiting the menu selection on a prepaid discount offer, I contacted the corporate office and was reminded that their locations are all franchised. So, FYI there is a much better run franchise 1/2 mile west on Bell!"
2,"The pizza here is really good. It has a real pizzeria feel to it. Also seems like a cool bar to hang out at. \n\nI havent had there wings but I heard they are pretty good. So I was going to order some for delivery one night. I tried to order them like I always order my wings, with the hot and bbq sauce mixed together and then tossed on the wings. They told me they couldnt do that. WTF?! Any legitimate place that sells wings will do this. So I asked if they could just put the hot sauce and the bbq on the wings, you dont even have to mix it. They still said no but they could put the bbq sauce on the side.. Haha, so I said, \""you cant just put the bbq sauce on the wings instead of on the side?\"" still no, so i said no thanks and hung up. \n\nKinda ridiculous if you ask me, It might sound like I was being a pain in the ass but i really wasnt asking much of them. I have worked at many restaurants and people order wings like this all the time, its a really simple task to complete. \n\nBut the pizza really is good."
1,"Average food, VERY limited delivery area, and abrupt customer service.  Very meh."
2,"The pizza and wings are okay. Nothing special. The wings were pretty good for baked, but aren't going to win any awards. \n\nBest thing about the pizza is the sauce, which is on slightly on the sweet side, making this better than the typical non-Chicago pizza."
4,"Super veggie pizza. Steve, is always totally friendly. Solid Craft Beer Selection with 10 or so taps.  Why don't they make their apps?..Music is good as well  but they usually have the same groups.  One of my favs in the (51) Corridor."
3,"Friendly, accommodating, and the pizza and wings are always good.  It is one of my go to places for a casual dinner out."
4,"I've been coming to this practice since we moved to the Valley in 1990 and the doctor before Dr. Dameron took great care of my teeth and Dr. Dameron takes just as great care.  I have a small mouth and he's very considerate, especially when performing procedures.  His staff of hygienists and assistants are very nice and pleasant to deal with.  I would recommend this office to anyone in the Phoenix area looking for a dentist."
1,"This place is just ordinary, there is nothing really great about it except that they deliver.  the best item I had on their menu was the shrimp in lobster sauce, the sweet and sour and orange chicken tasted like it was previously frozen and similar to something you can buy at costco in the freezer isles. They are a bit overpriced, but I think most of the asian food in Arizona is overpriced and lacking in authenticity."
3,"Just got back from breakfast at the 40th Street Cafe.  For a Tuesday morning, it was BUSY.  Only a couple tables open.  My waitress Sherrie was a total delight; I never saw a smile leave her face.\n\nI ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant (75 cents extra, totally worth it), sub bacon instead of ham, and sub scrambled eggs instead of the over hard egg just like I saw in a picture here on yelp.  It was great!  Loads of bacon, the eggs were great (not dry like other breakfast places like to serve you).  The hashbrowns were good - although not seasoned at all, like another reviewer noted, so I had to salt them myself... but that seems to be a norm for breakfast places like these, since a lot of their clientele is of the older generation who can't handle salt.\n\nLots of regulars here, lots of people just sitting drinking coffee and reading the paper.  Although one woman was totally rude and annoying - my waitress was taking the order of a woman sitting at the table next to me, and a woman at the table across the aisle threw her wadded-up straw wrapper at the waitress while she was taking the order - it almost landed in the full pot of coffee on the table - then apologized to the customer getting her order taken, saying she was trying to hit the waitress, and let out the most ungodly hyena-like guffaw I've ever heard.  I get that you know the waitress and you're trying to be funny, but jesus christ.  Have some respect and try to contain yourself.  She was at least 60 years old btw.\n\nANYWAY, overall it was a great experience and I had a good time just sitting there eating watching the price is right on their 20-year-old television.  I'll be heading back there for sure."
3,"Massage Envy \n\nI'd give you the name of my favorite massage therapist, but then I'd have to kill you. \n\nBack when I had a big paying job, I used to go to the Camelback Spa as often as I could. It's luxurious with awesome amenities in a gorgeous setting. Well, Massage Envy is NOT that. However, for those of us who are more money conscious, Massage Envy offers a wonderful experience. \n\nMassage Envy is located in a strip shopping mall. When you walk in, it's a pleasant environment and friendly check-in staff. After you sign in, you wait in comfy chairs until your masseuse calls you back. Each therapist has a copy of your chart showing your preferences and past experiences. They'll also ask you if you have any problem areas that need special attention. Then they'll step out of the room while you get ready for your treatment. \n\nMost of the masseuses will ask you about the pressure and your comfort. The massage table also has a built in heater, should you become cold. The lighting is soft and the music soothing. \n\nAll in all, this is a pretty awesome experience for $49 a month for your first massage and then $39 for any other massages you receive during that same month. They also have a family discount plan. If you need to use a different location, even out of state, your membership allows you to use the services of more than 600 Massage Envy locations nationwide."
4,"We have 4 dogs and a cat and it takes a lot to make my wife happy especially when it comes to her babies.  Dr. Kastner and Dr. W. are both great veterinarians and good people. The staff is awesome and we refer our family and friends all the time. They know us and our babies by name and provide old fashioned customer service. We have been to other vets and they are OK but this place is awesome! Great service, great information, good pricing, and they know and love our family. They listen to our concerns and only provide us what we need rather than selling us services and products just to make a buck. They will always have our business."
3,We us AZ Sunrays for Gymnastics and Dance...and I couldn't be happier!\n\nMy daughter is constantly asking when we are going again!\n\nStaff - friendly and want to teach their technique.\nFacility - clean\nClasses - engaging for the kids!
4,"school is almost over and last night when i went to our open house at school i realized how bless my kids are to be able to go there and what great teachers my kids have! This school is academically amazing (alex is 2 grades ahead, sara started the year struggling and now is getting a's and b's partly bc her teacher has given countless hours of her own time (free of charge) after school to work with her, & trey actually likes school!) This school doesn't just use the title \""christian school\"" this school is just as serious about academics as growing the kids in their relationship with the Lord. I truly think this is a treasure and i would love to share the experience with all my friends. If you are thinking about a change for next year, go visit before schools out, you have to see the kids there with the teachers to experience God's presence in this school!! With 3 kids in this school all with different academic abilities and personalities this school has been a great fit for all of them. Academically kids are pushed. If your child needs extra help a tutor will meet with them, also teachers have homework help times after school to work with kids. If your chid is gifted they will be placed in honors classes and be expected to perform!  I have kids at both extremes and know this first hand. My only downfall with this school is that after school programs are limited in the early grades. However, the school is always open to suggestions and if parents have a desire to start something I know from experience the school makes the time and the space. I feel like at this school a lot of the kids go to club sports, private lessons, etc so the school has tried but many of these kids are already spread thin after school.  We have been there for several years and I know from reviewing the national testing that my kids do every year that all 3 kids are at or way above grade level (even my child that struggles.) Your child will be pushed but PVCC believes in their students and they will provide the means to build confidence in the kids and to help them be successful and to grow in their abilities so the kids can stand on their own to be successful in later academic endeavors."
3,"Just about any kind of Asian food is always my preference so I've tried many places. Wang's Express is more of \""fast food\"" style restaurant but has a surprisingly large menu to choose from. They have lunch specials; which are like combo meals with rice and egg rolls and such, or dinner plates in different sizes. While I admit I'm not a fan of their egg rolls, everything else is amazing. I recommend any of their chicken or beef dishes personally (Orange Beef is my favorite) and the Crab Wantons. So if you want fast awesome Asian food but sick of Panda Express, go check out Wang's Express."
1,"We walked out.  There was no reason for the poor service we got this evening.  As there were very few people there, lots of open seats were available.  We were seated by the bus boy as soon as we got there.  Then we waited.  When everyone else is already eating 2 minutes is to long to make a table wait.  We left.  My wife spoke out about how this was her 2nd horrible experiace at this location in as many weeks.  Tonight she was feed b.s., l's and e's about how there was a credit card issue.  To us it looked as if our server was just goofing off not really caring if he waited on anyone or not.\n\nGood luck with dinner service here, We've never had this experiace during breakfast, so it'll stay a breakfast place, maybe lunch, but no more dinners."
2,"Everyone tells me I should have had one of their burgers. But it was morning and breakfast seemed like the way to go. Silly me. \n\nBreakfast was ok. Nothing to write home about, but it was ok. Hotcakes were kind of chewy (yeah, I'm not sure they should be chewy). My Mom used to say that pancakes should be light and fluffy. My eggs (over easy) were perfect. White all cooked, but yolks still runny. Sausage patties were a little dull. I should have gone with the recommended links. Lesson learned. \n\nWould I go back again? Yep, but I'd have a burger next time . . . even for breakfast.\n\nService was very good. Thank you. \n\nStanding outside in the parking lot after wards saying goodbye to my dining companion, we noticed that one of their three (3) American flags was hanging upside down. Did that mean they were in distress? A little bit in distress? Two were right side up. Or did someone just put it up wrong and not notice? Or perhaps it was a signal for breakfast and now that it was almost lunch the distress was over. Before my companion could go in and let them know, an employee came out and reversed the distress signal. Whew! Burger anyone?"
0,"This was some of the worst sushi I've ever had, especially for the money. I could barely get it down. The place is dumpy and depressing inside. All around terrible."
0,"My less than stellar review is for service.   We waited 30 minutes for our meals to be delivered.  When we questioned the waiter, he was not helpful, so we asked to speak to the manager.  The manager did not even come to speak with us!   We were loyal neighborhood customers, even walking to the restaurant frequently!   My husband then wrote an email to the owner, and it was ignored by him as well.   This is obviously a business that does not value customer service, we were very disappointed and Eastwind has lost regular customers"
0,"This place used to be a great inexpensive dive to grab a bite with friends. They got rid of table service, so now you must order food and drinks at a counter. What little staff that are still there seem to be inexperienced and nervous. Food quality has gone down yet their prices have gone up ruffly 35 percent. You are now paying Kabuki prices for no service, blah food quality, and a busted up environment. It's a real shame that this place fell apart."
1,"I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, a small order of pasta salad, and a drink and it came out to $13. For $13 I could of gone to a restaurant. Paradise Bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off."
2,"Not impressed. Customer service we received wasn't up to par -- guy wasnt able to answer simple questions regarding products they sell. Spoke with store manager who took care of the situation really well, but not blown away with their products. Ended up throwing a Turkey in our roaster bc everyone was disappointed on Thxgiving :/"
0,"Where do I start, well, let me just make this short and simple....  We had ordered from them the delivery/ catering option to be delivered on the 24th for a Christmas eve party.    40 guests were invited, that's right 40, and would you believe it, they never show up!!!! I mean, no phone call, nothing, the plans  and evenings of 40 HUMAN BEINGS, customers, potential customers, WERE NOT FED and this is on CHRISTMAS EVE for a party, not that easy to just change plans.  And can you believe as the hosts how we felt, this was beyond something terrible, this was a Christmas Nightmare!!! This place was even called the day before at 2:00 to verify the order.  No excuses on this one.\n\n\n Places like this, who could even possibly do this to their customers, or fail to deliver in this fashion, there should be a law against this, this was just wrong, beware people, on just principle I would say this place in not worthy of ones business, after this incident, I am left speechless, it caused soo much stress and heartache, unbelievable..."
1,"YUCK!\n\nI have not been cooking lately - busy with work and home...\n\nI went there for homestyle food and it was not good.  \n\nAlso, like the previous reviewer, the server did not know anything about homestyle food."
3,"Quick, helpful, and clean  what else do you want?"
2,"Not a huge fan of Baskin-Robbins.....but they do have a decent deals during the week but only during certain hours. The place is nothing special and the seating area along with the tables are always in disarray. I hear this establishment has been around for many years but this one is very small....outdated....and a bit messy. Some renovations might improve it....but for the most part I would go elsewhere for Ice Cream. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
3,"When I lived in Arizona ( from age 5 to 30), I ate at La Parilla Suiza a lot, at several of their locations. This is the one closest to my childhood home, and I think it was the prettiest of the restaurants. My mamma and I used to eat lunch there. My dad and his third wife liked it too ( but not with my mom, of course).... anyway, ahem.\n\nI love their melty cheese and mushroom appetizer, their chips and salsas, their tamales and enchiladas.. and the fajitas. \n\nIn college a Latino friend of mine took me to eat fajitas at the one in Tucson near the U of A campus, and I was busy forking chicken and peppers into my tortilla ( daintily, like a lady) when he took my fork away, put a tortilla in my hand, and said \""no, LIKE THIS!\"" and demonstrated how to grab the stuff in the tortilla.\n\n I have to admit, it was faster and more fun. \n\nThe fajitas are typically really really good, across the board. \n\nI miss LPS and as much as I try to emulate their fajitas in my home, it's not the same. they do a great job. If you get to Phoenix or Tucson, give it a try. MMM. \n\nOh, and the tortilla soup, to die for. Really.\n\nP.S. They catered my dad's wedding to his wife, and the food was fabulous."
4,"Wonderful daycare/preschool. My kids have been there for 2 years and we have had great experiences with all of the teachers. They have a Christian environment which at this age is perfect for any religion- a good foundation of bible stories, God and kindness which we can build upon at home."
1,Service is almost always slow and food is just okay. Even my beer was warm tonight. Kinda of pricey but what do you expect out of a hotel restaurant?
1,Stick with sandwiches.  Everything else is so-so.
1,"The room and staff were great.  Great room, clean and up to date. The restaurant there is anything but good. It is mediocre at best and very overpriced.  I got a Ruben sandwhich which I had to spit out- seriously.  It was thick meat and undercooked and grizzly. Awful. I have no taste of Russian dressing.  Room great... Food is horrid."
2,"Hotel\n\nNeeding a centralized place to crash with some members of my group, we chose the Courtyard Phoenix.\n\nI tend to prefer the Hyatt chain but Marriott is usually my second choice.  The place was affordable and check in was a breeze.\n\nRoom was good- not outstanding, but good.  Specifically the bathroom sink was barely draining and the air/heat unit came on with such a loud bang that it woke my ass more than once.\n\nBed was comfy and the free wifi was speedy enough - so no complaints there.\n\nAll in all a good experience save for the exceptions above.\n\nFriendly help all around the place too.\n\nParking all around."
2,"since i don't live here anymore,(and i already cashed me safety deposit) let me just say i really enjoyed my 3 years. it wasn't too loud- im like a granny and just called noise control when people were super obnoxious. loud parties at 4am on a weeknight are not cool with this loser. \n\ni never had to deal with extra parking bc i had a garage and a parking space. besides, it's not hard to figure out which spots are never parked in so you can use them for a night or two if you have a few guests. NEVER park on the ramp. a friend made that mistake only to find his car missing the next morning. \n\ni always felt safe, i never heard any stories of car theft or home theft and i was there for almost 3 years. \n\ntowards the end the staff was really getting on my nerves bc they NEVER answered or returned calls. the old staff was super good about doing things quickly but not the new staff. so just stop in and demand help. \n\nbe really annoying, i found that to help as well. call over and over, or leave 10 messages. \n\ni left my apartment spick and span so they charged me nothing for moving out and i got all of my money back. (they didn't even notice that i painted the walls and didn't paint them back to white) so it is definitely worth your time to clean before you leave- don't be gross. i even went above and beyond and made nice vacuum lines for them. \n\nthe only thing that bothered me on a regular basis were the people smoking on their patio. all of the patios faced each other so whenever anyone would smoke i could smell it. \n\nthe storage is amazing. i was able to fit more in my 600sf apt than i am  in my 1500sf house. i am exaggerating, but there were TONS of cabinets and the bathroom had even more cabinets. \n\nlastly, towards the end i noticed a lot more really yucky people moving in. im not sure if the prices dropped a whole ton or if they started offering assistance or what. but like, people with no teeth type of people. i had one on my floor and they would always lock their 10 year old out of the apt. i had to call the cops a few times bc she would be out there for hours asking to be let in.  :( but i think this might come along with being in this part of town? idk. all apartments have weirdos. \n\noverall, i enjoyed it and i would recommend it. the location was awesome."
2,"Good service.  Free sufficient size samples and not just a spoonful.  The regular size is more than enough! When I was there, they were out of a lot of flavors though =("
1,"Unfortunately my apartment complex caught fire, and I was forced to stay here temporarily.  My daughter, I and two cats came here. I asked for a \""handicap\"" room, as my knee had gone out. While the neighborhood isn't the greatest, the train noise can be bothersome.  However, I loved the safety bars installed throughout the bathroom as I had troubles walking. \n\nOverall if I had to do it again, I'd stay at the Scottsdale location."
3,"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  My family and I have been eating at Carolina's for about 12 years now.  It is truly delicious mexican food.  They have the best beans, tortillas and enchilada sauce in town!  I cannot get enough of their food.  My favorite meal is a bean & cheese burrito enchilda style with a butter tortilla on the side.  Try it, I promise you will thank me.  \n\nThis place is streaming with professional business people, police officers, firemen, construction workers and everyone in between.  The line is sometimes out the door on weekday lunch hour.  It is actually better to pre-call your order in, although the pick-up line can also pretty long at the lunch hour.  \n\nThe only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars is due to the location and building's interior/exterior.  It is in a pretty poor neighborhood in a crumbling building.  But hey...maybe that add's to the authentic appeal?  Another Carolina's recently opened up on Cactus & Cave Creek, same food but much nicer location.  \n\nAs an addendum to this review the food is definitely 5 stars - it is that good!  Try it!"
1,"carolinas, your enchiladas ruined it for me.\n\ni can't imagine eating another one of your soggy tortillas swamped in a pool of the most horrifying enchilada sauce my taste buds have ever met. mole overload and non-existent chile. lacking any real taste to it whatsoever.\n\ndisappointed."
3,"So after doing an internship in Downtown Phoenix, I was introduced to Carolina's. I was a little apprehensive at first, but I had heard many rants and raves about this hole and had to try for myself. After my first bite of Carolina's burrito, I was in love. It was awesome, and I continued to sample many of the items on Carolina's menu for the remainder of my internship, never once disappointed. I even brought home some of their famed tortillas - just those warmed with a little butter - simply melts in your mouth goodness. Awesome and cheap too!"
2,"I almost feel peer pressure to give it another star, but it IS just A-OK for me.  Been here a few times, trying to love it more... The tortillas are awesome, and buy as many as you're going to eat w/in a few days... the tortillas aren't full of crap and won't stay soft forever.\n\nBut for the rest, it's good or ok.  The Oaxaca burro consist of soft boiled potatoes (was scared it was the home fried kind) and really enjoyed it.  Meh on the enchiladas and the red chili beef's flavors were too muddied... not the bright chili flavor I get elsewhere.\n\nI'd come here whenever I'm looking for Mex in CenPho, but I wouldn't make a point to drive out to it."
1,"Had some tamales, and they were one of the worst I have ever had! There is no way this place is the best in town? Now I am not condemning this place, I will come back and give them another try. I will try something different and maybe I might change my mind. But I just don't get the hype!"
2,"This was supposed to be one of the best Mexican food in Phoenix and to be honest it was okay.  Don't get me wrong it was good but not one of the best.  The tortillas were very good, but everything else was just okay.  The last thing, bring your bullet proof vest, just kidding it just in a rough part of town.  Give it a try and see for yourself."
3,The best beef tacos in the valley!!! I also love the salsa because it has the right amount of heat. The homemade tortillas are excellent and I always get an order to go. I would give it five stars but the building is a dump. Still love Carolina's though!!!
2,"Food and salsa are great the service is always bad. I have been going here on and off for about 6 years and will be giving them another break in service for about a year. Not sure why you would call your order in a head of time and then wait for 3 breakfast burritos while watching people who just walked up to the counter receive their food. When I asked the young lady at the counter how they were getting their food before me when I called in 20 minutes prior she said it all depends who takes your order and who is making it... Well as I had an appointment to be at, that is why I called ahead and asked how long it would take, I told her to cancel my order to which she said \""Okay!!\"" with a big smile. I sure hope their food quality never gets to low because their customer service won't save them. See them again in a year... well if they are still there."
2,If you aren't afraid of the atmosphere you'll probably like this. Not for anyone that has any diet restrictions. But man was it packed and cheap. I felt like we had found the Dallas Buyers Club of z Mexican Food.
3,Chorizo and bean burro and the butter tortillas are a must have! The tortillas here are sooo good :)
0,"Just ate here and have never been so disappointed in a local Mexican restaurant. The green chili and beef burro consisted of 90 percent beans, 5 percent green chili mush and 5 percent beef. Both burros we got fell apart completely as soon as we lifted them up to take a bite - all of the filling came out of the bottom. My mom got the enchiladas. The sauce was okay but the tortillas were stale and difficult to cut through and chew. I wish I could say that my experience was at least satisfying but it sadly wasn't."
4,"I needed bodywork done on my car & after asking around my work mechanics all recommended me to see Ron at at Toms Auto Works. At first, I went to 4 other body shops with good ratings to get estimates and lastly Ron. Ron gave me the best bid so I went with him. His shop was very clean & professional. When I came to pick it up, I was extremely happy. They fixed it up better then it looked when I originally bought it!! And they washed and shined it :) I will def be back... Excellent service & work!"
3,"I'm originally from NC, so needless to say, I'm incredibly picky about my BBQ.  For instance, I feel that neither the sauce nor the smoke should over-power the meat.  No place in the valley has a true NC BBQ sauce, but if you like thicker, heavy BBQ sauces as opposed to the thinner, vinegar based sauces that we have in NC, then you will love Hap's sauce.  I'm of the opinion that smoke should complement the meat not over-power it, and they absolutely achieve this expectation of mine.  You shouldn't assume that I mean that their BBQ has no flavor; it absolutely does, and it is perfectly balanced.\n\nWith that said, Hap's is by far the best BBQ I have found in the valley.  Their ribs and pulled pork are spectacular!  They have a strong, smoky flavor without over-doing the smoke as a lot of places do.  Their brisket is not as good as the ribs and pork, but It's still better than most places I've tried in the Phoenix area.  This opinion has to do to with my pork biases: We don't think highly of beef BBQ in NC.  I've tried their lamb as well, which I wasn't a fan of, but if you like beef BBQ, you probably would love the brisket or lamb.  My only complaint is that they're not open on Sundays.  I highly recommend this place!"
4,"I travel across the country on a weekly basis, and eating barbecue is what gets me through the days. I have eaten at every good barbecue spot from Kansas City to North Carolina and not once have I come close to the greatness that I experienced today in this joint and I live right here in Phoenix.\n\nI got the sampler and it was worth every penny!  I've never experienced a more flavorful, juicy, meaty rib in all of my travels! The pulled pork was so tender with just the right amount of smokiness....mmmmm. I've never had smoked lamb, but will dream about it from this day forward. They make a minty sweet sauce to go along with it and it is a real treat!\n\nI give this family five thumbs up for starting this place and serving the best 'que of all time!"
0,"I booked a rental through Costco Travel.....\n\nthe line was extremely long( like waiting for a ride at Six Flags).\n\nIf you prefer to use a debit card, they will slap $200 dollars more on hold in your account and run a credit check. I think that it's the most ridiculous thing ever. \n\nI hate the fact that I didn't get to choose my car at their garage. A slip was given to me on where my rental is parked, and I had to get to it on my own; without any personal interaction if i had any questions about the vehicle. I didn't like the Ford Fiesta they rented out to me. The breaks were making some sounds....AND!!! it was cherry red. I didn't like a cherry red car.\n\nOther companies gave you options and are more personal. Some even pull the car up for you, and help you put your luggage in the trunk.\n\nI like to be treated like a princess.\n\nTheir insurance is also pretty expensive. I was shell shocked and for the very first time, i drove a rental without any form of insurance. Thank goodness, the car was alright. My damage: $152 for a 6day rental. Not bad."
0,"Crap. Crap. Crap.\n\nYour local \""Independent Weekly\"" owned by a HUGE corporate conglomerate that owns something like 16 other \""Independent Weeklies\"" in other towns.\n\nHorrible layout.  Horrible entertainment writers. Great for puppy training and starting fires.\n\nCrap. Crap. Crap."
1,"Not so much a liberal approach to reporting as a brainless attempt to convey \""news,\"" New Times has continued to disappoint and frustrate me on a weekly basis. So, why do I subject myself to the pain of this paper? Usually, only two things [garnering it the two stars]: Savage Love and the Night&Day. The former keeps me informed (and sometimes offers new ideas to keep that spark going ;) ) while the latter gives me something to plan on doing over the weekend. Honestly, it was N&D that turned me on to Cazwell. Some times the restaurant and movie reviews aren't painful. Otherwise, there is no worthwhile content in this paper. That, and I feel I've been duped by their fabricated stories a few too many times and you're wasting your time; you're not The Onion and are wasting our time if you think you are.\n\nWhile I consider myself left-of-center, New Times just dives off the deep end without its inflatable floatation devices. I'm not member of Sheriff Joe's fan club, but I don't view him as a serpentine demon. And while I admitted up front that the sex column piques my interest, the avalanche of provocative advertising is too much at times. I don't want to think my sushi has been in contact with a naked person, thank you very much.\n\nWhen we buy a house that has a little more property and I can start my garden, New Times will be part of that process. It will do wonders to keep the weeds at bay."
3,"Love their fried fish with fries and the endless supply of ranch. Oh sooo good! The price is right, the service is ok. There's room for improvement. Call in your orders during rush hours."
2,"I thought Knock Kneed was pretty good.  Although a bit pricey for what you get, I think the ingredients are pretty quality.\n\nWhat I did notice about the fish is that it doesn't taste super fishy.  Not sure if that's good or bad for you but for me it was great.  I'm not a person who really likes much seafood as I feel it's always too fishy for me.\n\nI got a combo with two pieces of fish.  The breading was outstanding and the hush puppies were dynamite as well.  I'd probably go back just for the hush puppies.  \n\nThe condiment bar is a nice touch as well.  You can get all the cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, hot sauce and malt vinegar you want.  Love it.  I got all those.\n\nThe cole slaw was pretty decent.  I'm 'A-OK' with this place but I'll probably have to make another visit before I up the star quotient.  \n\nAmbience,..?  Uh...it's alright.  I like the open window lighting.  But the 'hood aspect of the location gets five stars from me.  Two strip clubs within walking distance.  Well, allllright.\n\nPretty good."
2,"Knock Kneed Lobster is a classic standby that offers damn decent fried fish n chips. It beats Pete's and Pirates by a mile (but god do I hate Pete's) and the fish is freshly breaded in the back, fried to order: not frozen hunks of prefab awful.\n\nThe breading is very crisp and the fish flakes apart and is quite tasty with a generous dose of salt and lemon. The fries are basic, run of the mill fries, but they do the job.\n\nI used to love Sullivan's Pier in Mesa, which was the family's Mesa location, because they had this legendary coconut shrimp and tropical sauce. Sadly, both are missing at KKL, though their other offerings are good.\n\nYou're definitely at a dive; that's part of its charm, I suppose, but it is what it is. It's also just a buck or two more than you might expect to pay for a fish n chips lunch, but it tastes fresh and good and I'm alright with that."
2,They have good kettle corn
0,"I feel so bad for those live Midget horses. It was so hot out there, and one was limping. My wife was so bummed, and it ruined our whole shopping experience. \n\nOther than that, it's the same ol parkn swap, just getting smaller, and smaller every year."
0,"I was excited when I bought my project car. Hey, it was in pretty good shape for its vintage and it's very rare. I did need to have the bumper chromed as they were off a late mid century Japanese car. These cars where not known for their sturdy materials, every knows that. \n\nWell, I decided to put all my faith in the folks over at Papago and it turned out to be a massive blunder. Well, they probably did their best. But, their best isn't good enough to restore your dream. Hey, if you need a tub faucet done, go to them. In addition to a filthy location, you'll get some rudeness, a lot of lateness (and a few \""We'll have it tomorrow afternoons\"") and then, when they botch the job, they'll tell you it was the material they had to work with? Really, the same material that I brought to you weeks before and asked you to make perfect? The material?\n\nSo, now I have to live with this substandard job and take it to a real restoration place, one that knows what they're working with and won't blame the material for their botched work. I gave them a 1 ranking, after all, they get me SOMETHING back. Nothing I want, but it is something. \n\nEmail me, I'll show you the kind of work they did for me."
1,"FYI - if you plan to rent a car, allow extra time.  All of the car rental agencies are located in a separate terminal.  There's just one big bus to hop onto.  In light of the new TSA regs, they have little baggies for you to put your gels into [or lip glosses in my case].  Here's the interesting thing....At PHX they're drawstring... LAX has totally different bags....draw your own conclusions.....\n\n\nETA.  GGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....I had to update this review.  The only reason it's not one star is because my bag showed up....EVENTUALLY.  I recently had to check a bag from Phoenix to Oakland, because it takes more than a quart size bag of liquids and gels to maintain the Rhubarb for a week.  Somehow, my bag and I did not end up on the same flight.  They found it within 24 hours of me getting home.  But it was a LONG 24 hours, and they just weren't very nice about the whole thing.  At one point this chick asked what was in my bag....um, I don't know.  I told her I did not make a list because I did  not anticipate the neanderthals at PHX would lose my beloved Samsonite wheeley.  When she asked me what type of bag it was, I said, do you want a serial number????  \n\nOK, end rant.  let's hope they do better the next time."
3,"The airpot is splendid.  All the rental car locations are in one place, so you just need to find the one shuttle.\n\nBut what makes this airport better than others? They provide booties for you to wear when you take off your shoes, and ziplock bags in case you forgot to put your 3 oz. bottles of whatever liquids into ziplocks.  \n\nThe airpot does need some color though. From inside the terminals looking out, the entire airport looks sand-colored."
1,"I liked the old airport better.  I hate large, hard to navigate, walk forever to get to your gate airports.  My parents and I once didn't find each other till an hour after I landed because it was so big and confusing.  My parents always hated that there was ALWAYS construction going on there and it kept changing so you could never be sure the route you took one time would work the next time you went.  It was almost easier to just drive there from San Diego than to fly."
3,"What can you say about an airport? I'm sure someone out there will find plenty of things to complain about but I have flown in and out of PHX for years and never had any issues. I even flew out on the first day open after 9/11 and everyone was great and things were running smoothly. I can't complain, they know what their doing down in PHX."
0,"I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.\n\nThe bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's \""one person\"" for both directions.\n\nThen to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times."
1,"I've never checked in at this airport, restricted entirely to layovers. What stands out, however, is how many fellow fliers I spend time with complain about the check-in service and security. I don't know what's going on from that side, but I hear it time and again.\n\nFrom my side, I can't help but notice that I have to change gates nearly every flight thru there. Since I'm usually sleeping, I've been lucky to wake up shortly before the announcement with time to make the gate-change. As has been noted in other reviews, the terminals are far apart and gate changes can be rather drastic.\n\nOne big positive is the lack of arm rests on the seats. This makes it real easy for a peep to catch up on some quality nappage. There are also a lot of places to eat or drink at, all with the standard airport mark-up but with at least some variety. This 'port makes for an acceptable layover, but I've so far been able to avoid checking in here and suggest the same."
1,"Okay. Disregard anything else previously said. Driving in and around this airport is a N-I-G-H-T-M-A-R-E. Strange ramps that lead you in circles, easily missed turns, etc. Trust me, I've been compared to a human version of Google Maps, and getting lost is a once in a blue moon experience for me, but this airport has continually duped me. Looking for Terminal 2? Good luck."
3,"I'm a weekly regular as business traveler. I love how easy it is to get through this airport, if It wasn't, I'd probably quit my job. Most of the time I travel is on the west coast so I mostly go Southwest, terminal 4. Terminal 4 is probably the larger of the 3, and can be a bit overwhelming at first, southwest, US Air are the two big airlines that fly out of this terminal. \nI love that SW has outlets now so you can charge your cell phones and knock out some work on your computer \nQuick tip is to pack light, print your boarding pass b4 hand and head straight up to level 3 and go directly to gate. Sunday afternoons/evening and Monday morning are high traffic tine so I avoid flying on those days as well as weekday early am flight before 9am, anything after 9 is a breeze. \nUtilize east economy parking $8 day vs terminal overnight parking @ $25 day (ouch), Buses run every 10 min, I've never had to wait to long. The Gecko bus which is the west side of the lot has a quicker bus route (avoiding the overflow lots) like the Roadrunner. \nAllow for extra time due to the construction going on at airport."
1,"Not so much a fan of this airport.  Is it just me, or do you feel like you've landed in 1985 when you get off a plane here?  The furniture and d\u00e9cor need some serious updating.  And I'm not picky about my airport interior design, but it's just depressing here.  Everything seems so dim and dingy and worn-out.\n\nAnd despite free WiFi, there is a major dearth of outlets in this airport.  What outlets we could find were dead, too.  Awesome.\n\nAnd sure, the layout *makes sense,* but does everything have to be so spread out?  You'll be excited to fly into A12 and hear your connecting flight is leaving from A22 only to discover you have to walk a mile to get there.  \n\nThere are some good food options, I'll give them that.  I had an excellent burrito at 10 am Phoenix-time, because I was on Eastern-time and starving for lunch, which made people stare at me like I had three heads.  And on the way back through, a bagel breakfast sammie I enjoyed.  You know you're a Yelper when you remember airports by meal."
0,There was a wendys. Thats it in my terminal worth mentioning.  Bathroom doors don't lock.
1,"If I ever wanted to feel like I was in a movie I'd rob a bank for the thrill or date a 15 year-old. \n\nEvery time I've made a connection here I've sprinted, shoved my way and slid feet first to the next gate (TERMINAL). Whether I'm on time, late or early. Rieffendiculous! Who the hell is in charge of coordinating the connections?\n\nI suspect someone is on Colored Time and it pisses me off. \n\nAlso, I 'd like to speak to the architect who designed this airport 'cause this cumulative time consumption is busting my balls. Thanks Shek S."
2,"I know this place intimately........good customer service from all the airlines, great fast check-in of luggage and the airlines are usually on time.  Food is mediocre though.  Baggage claim can be a bit of a wait though...usually 20-30 minutes."
2,"A quick update after my first business trip in more than 8 months:\n\nAs a nursing mom, I now have more to worry about when going through security.  At 5am on a Friday (which is actually quite busy because of all the business travelers returning home to the East Coast).  TSA had to place each of my clear bags into the bomb-matter-detecting machine, but the agent was more than courteous, explaining the process and what would happen if the machine alarmed.  Luckily it didn't.  Even though I had over a dozen bags that had to be scanned, I was done in 5 minutes.\n\nThere's not much in the Delta portion of Terminal 3, but Starbucks and Wendy's are usually open for breakfast, though the lines are quite long.\n\nNow that the construction is done, it's much easier to find the rental car shuttle.  And I was pleasantly surprised at how short the wait was at 12:30am, despite the multitude of people who'd arrived late like me.   The rental car shuttles always smell quite strongly of soapy air freshener, almost to the point of making me sick.  I guess that's better than smelling dirty, but it is quite overpowering. \n\n#Yelp365 - 169/365"
2,Lots of construction going on here. But the traffic is never heavy so its ok. they have decent places to grab food and have cool trinquet shops for souvenirs . I come here cause I don't think there is a choice.
1,"Bleh.  This isn't one of the better airports to fly into or depart from.  Not only is the interior in a serious need of a remodel, the eatery options are limited (with the exception of Terminal 4).  Couple that with the seasonal threat of thunderstorms and it adds up to an airport I try to avoid.  \n\nThe most craptastic feature of this airport is the \""U\"" shape of Terminal 4, with no direct connection between the A and D gates.  This isn't a big deal for people that connect on U.S. Air and Southwest since the airlines are clustered by carrier in the same or nearby gates, but if you have a multi-carrier trip (U.S. Air/Southwest combo for instance), have fun walking 20 minutes from the A to D gates.\n\nIf Phoenix is your destination, note that the off-site rental car counter takes 15-20 minutes to get to with the shuttle bus."
4,"I love this airport. Seriously people. My home airport is LAX. Do you know how much it sucks!! \n\nPhoenix has a lot of things going for it :\n\n- It is a relatively easy airport to navigate. It is spread out, so those of you with children or disabilities may have a little bit of a harder time but there are mobile walkways which are a big help. \n\n- FREE WIFI. Seriously. It's like one-click access too, I love it! \n\n- Plenty of places to eat. There are  little cafes, sports bars, kid friendly places, stores with snacks. There's tons of places to eat!\n\n- Childrens playground (international terminal), it's a nice little way to wear out kids who are going to be on long flights.\n\n- Plenty of restrooms (I never once encountered a line...)\n\n- Clearly marked TVs with flight information. \n\n-  Security moved quickly both times I was there (Christmas Eve and New Years Day).\n\n- Impressive baggage claim (as Heather said the TVs tell you where your bag is going to be, avoiding all confusion). \n\n- Lots of windows to view the amazing Arizona sunset."
0,"To hell with this airport and really, to hell with Arizona.\n\nThat hurts me to say, I met my wife while we both lived and worked at Grand Canyon, and I've spent a lot of time in mostly northern Arizona.  At one time I dreamed of retiring to a small ranch with lots of big dogs and Mount Humphreys looming in the distance.  No more, those days are long behind me.\n\nThe combination of my disgust with Phoenix - really just a hotter, dryer version of LA -  and the unseemly politics of people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Governor Brewer have  pretty much taken me to the point where I don't plan to set foot (or spend another dollar) in that state.\n\nThis airport blows.  It's huge, if you rented a car it succeeds in outdistancing even Providence in terms of how far you must travel to get your vehicle.  Plan on an extra half hour to take shuttle buses and then hunt for your car due to the extreme lack of effective signage and staff.\n\nAnd please tell me why the hell I'm paying for your football stadium.  Your team sucks, you have a (ridiculous) corporate sponsor for it,  so why are people who could not care less about the Arizona Cardinals paying a stadium surcharge?\n\nI'll continue to vote with my dollars, and none of them will be heading to Arizona.  As someone who flies a lot, all over the world, Sky Harbor is on my personal shit(hole) list."
3,The TSA was extremely friendly and understanding
1,"My experience here is not one that has a lot to cover. I was pretty much in and out here so I can't really give a glowing report. Usual fashion the better restaurants are in the main terminal and if you head out to security you end up on one of the satelites and then you have limited selections. I do wish that there were more connections ports for power as many people were wainting in line to power their various mobile devices. I have been in many a better airport than this, nothing overly negative, just nothing to write home about."
2,"typical airport, moody security and the boarding areas are pretty small"
2,"As many times as I have come through here, I don't have much to say.  Maybe that's a good thing.  It's not the kind of airport you enjoy navigating within.  You just kind of want to get out and on your way.  The rental situation has been a sore spot for me, with lackluster experiences every time.  Once you're in the car and on your way, however, I will say it's relatively easy to access getting to the city or on the highway out."
2,"The Good: Free wi-fi, fairly easy to get around (Terminal 4), Decent dining options (Terminals 3 and 4)\nThe Bad: Parking in their garage can cost you dearly, relocation of offsite parking shuttles, terminal 3's somewhat confusing layout, Terminal 2\n\nBeing a person who frequents this airport, I can tell you it is not Incheon nor Dubai.  However, it is a decent sized facility that can accommodate larger aircraft.  Many of the gates now have newer jetways to accommodate the larger A321s and could easily accommodate the A330s/340s.\n\nFood options are decent, even though scarce in some terminals.  However, that is changing.  They are building restaurants such as McDonald's and adding new ones such as Starbucks.  Even baggage claim has a Starbucks.  \n\nThe above is mostly about Terminal 4 but Terminal 3 has good food options but the terminal is very dated.  Has a fairly confusing layout to the unfamiliar.\n\nTerminal 2 is even more dated.  Shame that United and other carriers use this terminal when spaces are available at 3.\n\nOne of the biggest problems I have with the airport is how the off-site parking shuttles are positioned.  The best way to describe the area is chaotically dangerous.  It is literally at the end of the airport where traffic at different points merges and in front of the corporate cars.  Just imagine a parking or hotel shuttle trying to get in and a corporate car trying to get out with traffic whizzing past between 35-50 mph.  Herding cats would be more orderly."
3,"I am most likely considered a \""casual\"" traveler, I take one to three flights a year at the moment, and I've had pretty consistently good experiences here at Sky Harbor, plus the thought of a bunch of wonderful local restaurants and breweries moving in sooner or later just makes me all kinds of happy. The traffic around the airport is always very manageable, whether it be foot or vehicle traffic, the runway has never been swamped enough to delay any of my flights, I have never been harassed or detained by security for any reason, and there always seems to be someone nearby if I need help with anything. I even will typically show up a bit early to hang around the airport and explore for a little bit... I've been to quite a few airports in my day and I've got to say Sky Harbor is my favorite."
0,"Had to stop here for connecting flight coming from cancun. After customs, u have to physically get ur luggage (the one u checked-in) from the carousel, then check it again for your connecting flight. The problem i encountered was going to security again to go to the gate for my connecting flight. The security specifically shouted to everybody that we need to take out all liquid we brought and place it on top of our bags as it entered into the scanner. This caused so much hassle because i didnt expect they demand such a thing. I fly a lot and this was the first time they demand such. Of course since i didnt know, the specific liquid (mouthwash) was at the bottom of my bag and i have to remove all my stuff out of the bag to get it..urgghhhh!!"
2,"Free WiFi! Spread far out, but I guess if you have one thing in Arizona, it's space"
3,Great airport to fly in or out of.
1,"Most confusing airport ever! I've been to quite a few airports and I've never seen an airport so difficult to navigate, that includes walking around inside and driving on the roads outside.  Just very poor signage.  Airport is nicely updated though..."
0,"You guys are too kind.  MacRae's review was on the mark but conceded one too many stars.\n\nThis is 1985.  Old, ugly, worn out, and dirty.  Time to replace the carpet and the furniture, y'all.\n\nIn 1985 no one had laptops, phones, kindles, and notebooks to charge.  In 2013 they do, and \""Sky Harbor\"" hasn't adapted. Does the general manager ever wonder why people are sitting on the floor by the wall outlets.  There was one charging station that I saw, but it didn't work.\n\nDid I mention that the waiting areas at the gates weren't large enough for the number of people on the flight?\n\nThere is free WiFi.  And unlike SD, there is more than one runway."
0,"I hate this airport, friendliest my ASS! From security to gate agents to bus drivers to parking cashiers, this is one of the LEAST friendly airports I have ever subjected myself to. I've lived in many cities and currently have to endure the complete crap this airport is in every imaginable way. I'm so frustrated with it I will consider driving to LAX just to avoid using this shit hole. Yup, sitting here now after getting effed by United on a code share with Lufthansa. Umm, Lufthansa... why do you code share with this abomination of an airline? Maybe driving to Tucson is an option because I am not coming back to this place. PHX? BOO!"
1,"Most of this airport seems really nice. The security wasn't bad, but it was late afternoon, so I think we caught a good time.\n\nI, however, got stuck in the Delta terminal, and it was the worst airport experience of my life. First of all, there was a Starbucks that closed at six pm, y'all. SIX. There was this little burrito place that my friend and I decided to eat at because our only other options were Wendy's or a gift/convenience shop. That food was just.. no. It was not the worst I've ever had, but I wish I'd have gotten Wendy's. We were told it was the oldest wing of the airport.\n\nThe lady in the gift shop was really nice and told us our options, which was to go back out and then come back through security, or pick one of the two whole options inside. It was tiny, old, and definitely not built for the 21st century."
2,"Not my favorite airport, but definitely not the worst. TSA Sent me to the wrong place to get a SuperShuttle outside, which sucked in the heat carrying my luggage, but otherwise I had a pleasant experience. The security line was lonnnnng on a Thursday afternoon, but the TSA Agents were actually friendly. \n\nNote to all: You can opt OUT of that body scanner, its not required. Just as ai was about to request to opt out, a new x-ray machine line was opened and their scanner was broken sooooo I got to walk right through. Aces!\n\nI like the tables located at my gate with the charging stations, made getting some juice for my iPhone a lot easier."
2,"I will give it that it's a friendly airport, but it feels very dated in areas.\n\nI'm not a fan of the set-up that much either.  Now, in fairness I'm used to the Tucson Airport, but it just isn't very intuitive once you get inside.\n\nAlso, the concourses that I've been on have been lacking in quality food choices."
3,"The airport is not a bad airport at all. It's actually better than a lot of airports! I love that the roadways leading in and out of the airport is not too confusing. The only terminal that is confusing is #2 because it's not connected to the main building. \n\nBut it's nice inside. It has all of the usual restaurants and magazine stores and coffee shops. The coolest place is La Grande Orange. I was surprised that there was one in there in terminal 4. Good restaurant for food!\n\nThe place is pretty clean too. It's very well kept. They started upgrading the entire place. Now there's LCD boards giving you information on the roadways, recharge stations inside and a sky train that takes you to the light rail station. For free. To ride the light rail is not free. But you can be dropped off at the airport light rail station and take the sky train directly to the main check-in building. \n\nThe airport only keeps getting better. :)"
2,"If you've never been to the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, don't be alarmed - you aren't missing anything. Really. \n\nOn our most recent trip to Phoenix, we thought we'd see a lot of updates from our last visit but it still seems really outdated with very few restaurants to chose from. A lot of airports these days are getting facelifts and bringing in more trendy places to eat but not so much here.  At least not in the Southwest Terminal.  \n\nI will say, I love the moving walkways though."
0,"Gate C has to be the worst gate I have ever tried to pass through....horrible slow service and the TSA agents do not care if your handicapped or having a heart attack......they just ignore you....this gate takes the \"" Hurry Up and Wait \"" to another level.....still trying to get through the x-ray part 1 hour later.....not kidding.....I feel sorry for the First Class people who paid more money to get through the line faster....when they too have to wait....there must be about 20-30 people waiting to check into 1 st class....something seriously needs to be looked at in this airport!"
0,This airport makes no sense and has gotten to big for its britches.  The gates layout sucks and you can't tell who is coming or going.  It is hot and there are very limited charging stations.  The TSA folks all had their Cheerios peed in and were very rude.  The rental car area while nice is a 20min bus ride.  All in all not a fan for this sometimes necessary evil airport.
2,"Sky harbor in general is good but terminal 2- not much of anything. Limited restaurants and only few flights that fly out there. If you coming to terminal 2, then plan on not waiting out here too long."
1,Not a fan of this airport for one reason. There are very few ways to charge anything. Lots of chairs but no outlets. Not sure how such a busy airport can have such few options. Security was also a little strange I had pre-check which got me into a different line but then we just merged with everyone else. How does so much of the general public qualify for the pre-check line. It's not as bad as Midways system but it's up there.  Also I know it's 120 outside but does it have to be 90 on the inside?
2,"I travel quite often, always with the same airline so I have my routine pretty much down. I can see why a first timer would be confused or have a poor experience here the airport is HUGE. Be prepared to WALK especially if you are flying in. \n\nTons of places to eat even if you are not actually flying somewhere so whomever is dropping you off can park and go have a bite to eat with you. \n\nIf you're getting a rental good luck you have to take a shuttle to get to the rental port and it's usually busy so be prepared to wait a bit. \n\nIf you're flying in each and every time the bags take FOREVER to get the baggage claim port on average it's about a 10 minute wait BEFORE they announce that your bags are being loaded to whatever baggage claim port.. So once again be prepared to wait. Oh not to mention this is after about a 10 minute journey to the baggage claim area after you get off your flight."
2,"I've only transferred through the PHO a couple times (so I can't comment on the security), but I think it's just A-OK. \n\nHighlights\n+Gates have plush seats.\n+Not overwhelmingly large, so going from terminal to another isn't too bad. (Vy is absolutely right.)\n+Free WiFi.\n+The mountains surrounding the airport are gorgeous. \n\nDrawbacks:\n-I understand that airports have their fair share of chains, but this one seems to have slightly more.\n-Bathrooms are kind of bleh.\n-Not enough seats at gates. (Saw too many people sitting on the ground waiting for their flights.)\n-Too many people riding on the golf carts and drivers not telling people to get out of the way. (Like me.)\n\nThis airport is the definition of mediocrity."
2,"I fly into Sky Harbor quite a bit. Althought it's not the worst, it's not even close to one of my favorite airports - I prefer DFW (gasp!) over this one. \n\nFirst issue - way croweded most of the time - everywhere. It's sometimes difficult to find a place to sit. Second, the food selection is OK outside of TSA. Once inside it is limited and the places they do have are really crowded. Finally, getting a car rental is really a pain. You have to take a 10 minute shuttle bus to the rental hub. All similar to DFW except DFW has some pretty good eateries and places to just sit - it's much bigger. I have to say, TSA pre-check here is pretty quick though."
0,"The dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly.  The volunteers in kitty city were another story.  I've never had people make me feel like less than a human being than I did there.  A human being who came ready to adopt this afternoon had one of the cat volunteers given me the time of day.  I'm really sad cause I am a cat lover and our cat died in November.  The dog people were so nice I thought for sure kitty city would be the same.  I fell in love with a kitten in minutes but the attendants gave me either funny looks or completely ignored me for a family that was still looking around.  The service here broke my heart.  They are doing such a great service for animals, but I didnt feel welcome.  I'll have to find someplace else to go."
0,"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ORGANIZATION! They don't have animals' best interest in mind. My girlfriend and I found a really sweet stray dog we are currently fostering, and asked if they could help us network him to find him a home. Not only did they say no, they said they wouldn't help solely because he looks to be a chow mix. We told them that we would pay for his expenses and provide shelter, but they still turned us down without even meeting him! To top it all off, the woman we spoke with(Tracey Varga) was incredibly rude. What a disgusting and uncaring organization!\n\nUPDATE!!\n\nApparently they \""do not discriminate against any breeds\""... the email we received says differently. I've posted a picture of said email. We found a permanent home for the little guy this afternoon. So much for him being \""hard to adopt\"" huh? Choose carefully which organizations you support, folks. There are plenty of very helpful shelters which don't rudely shut down people trying to help."
0,I'll keep it short and sweet.\n\n- Overfilling parking lot. Good luck finding a stop to park your car. You may have to park on one of the alleys and hope that you won't find your car scratched/dented when you get back.\n\n- as you wait for a good 20 minutes or longer for a shuttle to get picked up from the terminal you'll watch 2-3 shuttles from other PHX parking lots pass. \n\n- pretty rude staff at the booth. Slow checkout.\n\nBottom line: spend a few cents more and park somewhere else.
2,"not a bad place to stay. the staff is fairly helpful, but doesn't seem to like their jobs too much. i was greeted with an audible sigh upon check-in like i just interupted a thrilling game of solitaire. the room was clean and comfortable, but this IS by the airport, so bring some earplugs. the \""high speed internet\"" they advertise and offer is nothing but wireless dial-up at best. but...the price is right, and there is a cool bar/lounge next door.\n\n2/29/08 - I left some dress shirts in my room upon checkout, and when I got back to California, I called them, and they sent them out UPS at no charge!"
2,"This place was just \""okay.\""  I would use the term \""old timey\"" to describe it.... I would also use that term to describe the clientele.  I went there for a business lunch, I would say that most of the older male population of Phoenix did the same.  I must also note that there is ZERO ambience-- it looks like a Best Western dining hall.\n\nOn to the food.  I had been craving prime rib, so that is what I ordered.  Though it was accurately cooked to be medium rare, the texture and flavor were not great.  The meat was bland, and it was not all that tender.  Even the au jus lacked flavor.  It was served with some sort of potatoes that I didn't really like either.  However, I have to say that my companion ordered the filet-- also medium rare-- and said that it was really good.\n\nI am not going to give this place a bad review, but I can't give it a stellar one either.  Im addition, the prices are a little high for such boring food.  I am truly ambivalent about Stockyards.... and life is too short to eat mediocre food.  ;)"
4,"Big fan of unique steakhouses across the country and this one joins the club!  First of all the Wild Boar and Venison sausages as a starter with chutney were full of flavour and so delicious.  The Buffalo Rib-eye may be a bit pricey but come-on, when is the next time you can complete the Boar-Deer-Buffalo Trifecta in one sitting??  The Buff rib-eye is full of deep, rich flavors and worth every penny....Service was excellent and the whole experience was a delight  - will return!"
3,"Stopped in here with my husband, his nephew and girlfriend for dinner last week. It was nephew's birthday and he loves steak so I wanted to take him special. Since this was the oldest steakhouse in Phoenix and a historical landmark for the city, it fit the bill. We all enjoyed our meals. My fillet was cooked perfectly. Nephew said his ribeye was a little salty but personally I enjoy some seasoning on my steak. I don't like it when places serve it totally plain... or worse, with a bunch of butter. A steak should be juicy enough to stand on its own with just a little salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. I did enjoy that we also got a very rich and beefy demi-glace as well (served on the side). I also liked that you get your choice of starch included with the steak as well as a soup or salad. I ordered the sweet potato mash which unfortunately I did not care for at all. There was something off about the taste and it wasn't as smooth whipped as I would have liked. I did really love the soup, though. That night it was a cremini mushroom bisque that was delectable. It would have gone really well with a good earthy red wine but unfortunately I wasn't drinking that night. Other people at the table enjoyed a few beers. They have the usual domestic and European choices as well as some taps from local Sonoran Brewing Company. For dessert hubby and I split the strawberry shortcake and they also brought out a chocolate brownie a la mode for my nephew. So nice!\n\nOverall, maybe the food was only worth about three stars but checking out the old photos of downtown Phoenix and all the cowboy art on the wall made it a cool experience. I really liked the old school saloon as well. This is definitely someplace every Phoenician should come at least once."
1,"So I guess maintaining customer service isn't their attitude. With a backyard that is half dirt. I get charged almost twice as usual. Telling me that it's \""overgrown.\""  I can say it was higher than it was when they were supposed to do my yard versus when they actually made it, but it was the same height as usual when they come. Additionally, they were only in my yard for 20 min. You can't mow and weed an overgrown yard in such a small amount of time. Good service is hard to find so this loyal customer will say good-bye to snappy lawns."
2,"This place is kinda hit or miss. One time I went and there on a Thursday night and there was a good selection of young girls that were friendly. Then on a Friday night there wasn't a single attractive in the place.\n\nThere is a $10 cover and the drinks are really expensive. This place is okay, but largely avoidable."
3,"Flew this airline once when I was flying from PHX to PDX (Portland, Oregon).  Really enjoyed my flight experience.  This airline flies out of Terminal 2, which is the first terminal once you are off from I-10.  Easy parking access and literally walk right in to the security check-point.  Will definitely try again if I'm going to the PNW area again."
4,"Late night great food as always.  Very clean, and staff was awesome."
1,I wish I had read the review recommending to avoid the stale wheat bread before I ordered.  It was stale. Mushrooms were canned. Did not like getting hit with the $0.35 credit card fee but the prices were reasonable to start with. I had a hearty and warm and salty sandwich that will keep me going all afternoon at work. Food was delivered fast. It's an OK stop if you don't have much time for lunch.
3,"We were on vacation in phoenix, and on the drive home our group was tired, hungry, cranky, and everything else that comes with a weekend of partying. \n\nWe were looking for a bakery that was doing breakfast, but could not find anything. We stumbled across this place, and we settled for lunch. \n\nThis was complete serendipity. We loved the food and the service was amazing, I think the girl who helped us was Ileen. She was incredible. \n\nWe all got different sandwiches, they were all super fresh, and very tasty. The baked potato soup was amazing. And we got 4-5 free cookies as well.\n\nWe walked out saying to each other, when we are back in the area, we need to come back here. \n\nThis place kills Panera. KILLS IT."
1,"The only reason I'm giving AccuTemp two stars INSTEAD of one is because their replacement specialist Mike was awesome.  If we could have dealt with him the entire time we would have gone ahead with the repairs -and likely be giving them a better review right now.  \n\nThe reason they are getting such a low rating is because:\n\nI called AccuTemp originally because I liked the fact that their technicians are non-commisioned.  I told the lady who answered the phone that I needed to schedule a repair estimate.  She responded, \""A repair estimate. Okaaay.\""  My initial instinct was to hang-up.  I have an A/C unit that is functioning subpar and I'd like someone to take a look at it.  Call it what you want, I could do without the attitude I was getting over the phone.  But I thought, just because receptionist irks me, doesn't mean their technicians aren't great.  So I clarified what I wanted and we scheduled an appointment for a couple days later.\n\nWe wanted an estimate for replacing the Air Handler up in the attic at a rental property.  The replacement specialist (Mike) gave us a quote, but suggested that we have one of their repair technicians take a look at the unit since there might be a cheaper solution to our problem.  We found Mike to be very honest, professional, and courteous.\n\nSo we set up another appointment with a repair technician.  We scheduled several days in advance and were told he would arrive between 1-5pm on Friday.  On Friday at 5:20pm the renter's called to let me know that nobody had showed up/ were wondering if they should keep waiting.  Now granted it was Memorial Day weekend, and I'm sure they were slammed, but a courtesy call would've been greatly appreciated.  I called the office and got the voicemail since it was after hours.  I left a message and waited hoping someone would call me back.  Finally I thought to call Mike (replacement technician) on his cell, even though he wasn't involved with our repair.  Within minutes Mike called me back and said he had called the main office and they should be getting in contact with me shortly.  Again, awesome customer service by Mike!  The main office did call shortly and said they could have someone out there around 7:30pm or the following morning.  The renter's were NOT happy with this at all as they had Memorial weekend plans, so we rescheduled appt for the following Tuesday.\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon I get a snide phone call (same receptionist, lots of attitude) that the repair technician is at the rental property, but nobody is home.  At the same time the renters are calling me to let me know it's almost 5pm and nobody's showed up yet.  So I asked the receptionist if she was sure he was at the right address (Ave not Dr. or St.)  Turns out he was at the wrong address,  She apologized and said he'd be there shortly.  He suggested we have two parts replaced.  But before he could replace anything we needed to install plywood in the attic so he could have easier access.  \n\nIn speaking with the receptionist to get clarification over what exactly was needed, she said two 8'x2' sections 1inch thick ($50 at home depot). I asked if the sections could be cut at all so we could fit them in our car, but she said \""No.\"" and suggested that we \""rent a truck from Home depot\"". We live 60miles away from the rental property and the whole process was turning into a huge headache. \n\nSo we went with a different company.  Visca A/C -(http://www.yelp.com/biz/visca-a-c-phoenix#query:visca%20air)  Their estimate for the same two parts was half the price of Accu Temp's (granted Accu Temp is a larger company/ probably has more overhead costs), but after checking the A/C they also said only one of the two parts even needed to be replaced /the other was working perfectly fine which again cut the cost of the repair in half.  And they said the attic was easy to navigate -no need for any plywood!"
2,"Yelp reviews sent me to this Company. They were a second opinion for repair over a personal recommendation. I was blown away by the professionalism of the technician and Dave ( install coordinator?). I would have given the company 4.5 stars but the original phone call to receptionist / assistant/ call operator was off putting. Kind of an air of arrogance. Made it past that to the actual nuts and bolts of the operations and was very satisfied even though the news was a unit replacement at $4k. Within 24 hours a crane was onsite and replacement complete. Then I received a phone call from Lisa for payment. Same attitude, coldness, indifference to my business. It's tough to see the people actually doing the work in the field professionally, honestly, and promptly get tainted by the phone answerer / bill collector. Fix that problem and this company is amazing. Overall still happy I chose them for my repair."
4,"Ambassador Blinds helped me come up with an idea for my 20' wall of glass in my home in Mountain Bridge.  They installed Hunter Douglas motorized  shades (with a Custom built wood cornice) and a wireless remote control.  That was 1 1/2 years ago and my remote control stopped working a couple of days ago.  I called JoDell yesterday and he and Alfredo were at my house today with a replacement.  I had thought I would have to wait for it to be ordered, but they just swapped it out!\n\nThey also did a great job on my wooden shutters!  I highly recommend them for all your window covering needs!"
0,"I had a tire throw a tread the other day in the extreme heat, so I limped in here for a used replacement.  The going price around town is $20 to $25 for a used tire, mounted, balanced, & stem.  This guy charged me $30, no stem, & he didn't even balance it!  The first time I got on the freeway it was like driving a paint shaker!  \n\nMy next tire experience was just about the opposite, buying a whole brand new set of four tires, mounted, balanced & stems for $143 at Firestone!  (* * * *)  \n\nI recommend that you AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!     :-O"
1,"Normally I try to stay away from McDonalds because they are everywhere so they are where I go when there is nothing else.  I still end up eating there every year or so with travel.  This time though I was just tired and it was the closest place to eat.\n\nI went through the drive through and got one of the chicken wraps with fries and a drink.  When I got my bag there was no ketchup!  They didn't even ask if I wanted any.  Despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing I had.\n\nI don't normally eat here so I can't comment if the blah taste of my food was typical or not, but it wasn't worth the calories.  Plus I was peeved to be without ketchup."
4,"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but serves up awesome food.\n\nOn a recommendation from DarrenC, I tried this place.  I drove right past it on my first pass, totally didn't even notice the little stand-alone building sitting back from Broadway in the ghetto.  They have burgers, BBQ, Catfish, sandwiches, etc.  The owner is, apparently, a preacher and likes to blast emotional, uplifting gospel-type music which, surprisingly, adds to the enjoyment of the place, and I am not a fan of church or religion.\n\nOh, and the best part.... they serve up sweet tea.  If you work around here, just try it, you will be adding it to your rotation, guaranteed."
1,"Based on the reviews, I had to to try this place. I had the pulled pork with potato salad and some sweet tea. I was no where near being blown away like many of the other reviews suggest. At best, my meal was just shy of mediocre. The pork was reheated in a microwave and the bbq sauce was bland. The potato salad was run of the mill with a factory fresh quality. I suspect it is purchased and not made in house. Even the sweet tea was lacking. It's probably closer to micky d's sweet tea than anything you will get in the deep south.\n\nI will say the place does offer value for what you get. It's just that the food is not special. What is special is the place itself. I will go back again and bring family or friends just to see the expression on their faces. \n\nIt's more about surviving the trip than it is about discovering a tasty hole in the wall."
3,"Went to AZ with my baby over the weekend. :)  He had to stop by his home office so I chilled at the library while he went to work. When he was done, he texted and said, \""Be there in 20 with food.\"" I was sooooooo excited because I know that my boo don't mess around when it comes to food. ;-) Actually what ended up happening was, we went together to get the food and yeah it wasn't ready when we got there but I know why. The gentleman behind the counter had cooked everything FRESH. I'm originally from L.A. so hole in wall places like Mim's are what I look for.  Loved the bacon cheeseburger and fries.  There's nothin better than a \""house\"" burger y'all. LoL.  Next time, I'm gone try the catfish... :)  Oh and the outside of the place looks sketchy but don't let that fool ya.  Again, I'm from L.A. so sketchy neighborhoods etc don't bother me.  The food is yum :-D Try it. :-)"
2,"The tortillas are very good, but the quality of the meat that they place therein is a bit of problem.  The first time I went I had the carne asado burrito, and although the taste was good, I chewed the meat in that thing for an hour and half and my jaw hurt. So the second time I went, I got the chicken burrito figuring the meat would be more tender. It was, but still the quality of the meat was lacking.  Again, the taste was decent. The third time I ordered a egg burrito for breakfast, and I must say that the quality of the eggs they put inside the burrito are just great.\n\nReally low prices and some nice baked goods.  I would certainly buy a bag of the tortillas they sell at the counter."
1,"The food was mediocre. The shrimp in my cocktail was stiff and rubbery, and the margarita I ordered was more ice and salt than alcohol.I would have settled for fast food instead. The atmosphere is nice and inviting, and the staff are courteous, but take a while to get to you after initially ordering."
1,"We went for a casual lunch on our anniversary because of the great Yelp! reviews. We have mixed reviews, ourselves, though. The lunch crowd was small...not a good sign, but it is near South Mountain, which isn't a hub of excitement during the week day lunch rush. Inside, the place is old and worn, but clean. The tables aren't very inviting. There are fish tanks with large fish in them. The place is warmer than we like, so the overall effect was a bit dark and muggy.\n\nThe people who work there are wonderful--extremely helpful and nice. Honestly, that is the only reason we decided to stay--didn't want to turn around and walk out just because it looked kinda grungy inside (that is, because the food reviews were all so good.).\n\nThe bottom line is this: Everything on the menu is seafood,and it is Mexican. We did NOT love our food, but we did not get sick later, either.\n\nThere are no other meats. If we were at the ocean I think it would probably be fantastic, but inland, uh....no. The fish tacos tasted extremely FISHY and not in a good way. The crab meat enchiladas were authentic, dang it, but unfortunately the verde sauce was too tangy and there was pimento in the mix. It left a \""stale\"" flavor in our mouths.\n\nWe would love to know the day of the week the fresh fish comes in. If we knew, we'd go back on THAT day. Otherwise, skip it."
0,Called today to order a pizza was told they won't deliver to me. No reason why. Nothing. I wont order from them again. Their loss. Funny they used to deliver here. Scoffs .. Guess my money isn't green enough for them.
4,Great diversity of plants and they have Christmas trees this time of year. I'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the grounds. Very friendly staff that helped us with putting the tree on the roof of the car
1,"I made an appointment for someone to take a look at my roof.  They were 15min late so I just left since this was for a rental.  They called me later and said I didn't need to be there, which was not what I was told by the person who set up the appointment in the first place.  \n\nSo this was on the 16th and sure its the holidays, but why does it take this long to drum up a bid?  So I sent a message through the website to which I didn't receive any response.  Then I called and an answering service took a message saying they were open that day and would call me back.  \n\nI've pretty much given up on this company at this point.  :/"
1,"Fairly mediocre.  Whenever I went by, unless the specific barber that I normally go to, you're liable to sit around for a few hours until someone is able to help you.  Another person said it best, \""I went to the \""Barbershop\"" for a haircut, not the whole damned movie\"".\n\nI discovered \""Esquire\"" downtown and it's certainly a busy professional's barbershop so that's my new spot.  \n\nI can get a professional haircut in a reasonable period of time."
2,"I frequent Jays.  Best gyro deal in the area.  The place is not fancy at all.  Don't expect that great of service.  Be sure to listen for your order to be up.  It is barebones, but my stop in Tempe for gyros.."
1,"It had been about three or four years since I last visited Jay's Gyros and thought I'd check it out again, hoping to find a meal which wasn't as forgettable as my last. It was. \n\nThe people here have no sense of customer service. While it's a quick serve restaurant and I didn't plan on five star service, a mere \""hello\"", \""thank you\"" or a simple smile would have been nice. The person taking my order didn't know the correct pronunciation of the word \""gyro\"".  Once my order was ready, it was placed on the counter and I only knew that because I barely heard a whisper of the announcement.  She couldn't speak up?!?\n\nThe facility is old and the furnishings dated. In fact, I think one of the interior pics posted here may also be outdated, as I don't recall the blue booth-style seats shown. Little effort has been made to spruce up the interior; not so much as blue paint on the walls which is common for Greek restaurants. There was one large screen TV with soccer on, but don't plan on catching a game here. The glare from the lights above would tick off any serious fan. \n\nI ordered the chicken gyro (about $6) and Greek fries (about $2.50.) Both were made to order and served hot. They fries were OK, but the paper bowl they were served in had been soaked through with lemon juice, making for a messy dish. The pita was fine, but nothing to write home about. The fixin's (romaine, tomato and onion) were crisp, cool and plentiful, but I didn't care for the rectangular strips of chicken at all. They didn't look, smell, have the texture of or even taste like chicken. They seemed just like frozen, processed pieces of mystery meat they got from some mass distributor of restaurant food. \n\nOne other thing I don't understand is their odd hours. Greek restaurants don't often serve breakfast and have to rely on their lunch and dinner business. Jay's closes at 4:00pm, so it's either lunch or the special-less early bird special. Guess I'll have to use the Del Taco drive-thru next door. I think their mystery meat is available 24/7."
4,"I work in the same dying business park as A.G.E. in Phoenix. Walked over said i need a new windshield, Curtis gave me a quote. Called them a week later best price in town next day FIVE STAR installation. no gimmicks, excellent service is what they do. \n\nI have had a few windshields replaced and this was by far the fastest, cleanest and top notch install. The last guy did not do a very good job replacing the molding on the windshield and i thought i wood have to buy new moldings. nope, dood was able to fit them in perfectly and looks excellent...\n\nThis company really is Auto Glass EXCELLENCE!!!"
4,"I know this is a long review but I hope at least one parent finds it helpful....\n\nOur two year old attends cactus preschool and we could not be more pleased. Prior to Cactus our little guy went to a \""big name\"" preschool (I wont mention the name) but it was horrible. Cactus has superseded our expectations on multiple occasions. The first week at his new school was a little rough and my little guy cried for the first 10 minutes every time we dropped him off. His teachers were patient and welcoming and now my son claps and sings when we pull up to the building. When I call to check on him they give me updates with out hesitation and with out making me feel like a parent that is being too needy. My son ALWAYS comes home with the cutest crafts that he made in class, the refrigerator ran out of space very quickly! My husband doesn't typically pick my son up and when he did the afternoon teacher made him run back to the car to get his ID before they would release our son to him. I was very impressed by that b/c teaches at his old school would just \""take our word for it\"" =\\ . My son got hurt while playing a fun game in his class and they called me almost immediately and tended to his tiny injury just as I would have, ice pack and some extra TLC. When i pick him up, his teacher always has control of the class room but in a way that is nurturing and interactive.  I really like the small window on the class room door. It lets me look in and see what and how my son is doing before disrupting the flow of things. I'm always pleased with what I see. We are potting training my son and they are so helpful with the process. His teacher actually asked us to bring in some big boy underwear, the previous school did not want the hassle of taking him to the bathroom every 30 mins to an hour and cleaning accidents.\n\n If you are looking for quality childcare I highly recommend Cactus on Southern. I feel like I'm leaving my little guy with a second family b/c they seem to care about the kids and not just the payment at the end of the week. Which by the way is another great feature. You only pay for service you actually use, if your kid is sick or you want to take a family day you don't have to pay if your child doesn't attend. Even on my days off I'm tempted to take him because he loves it so much and he really gets a lot out of it.\n\nMy only complaint is the location. Its not in the best area and shares the corner with a gas station that is your typical south phoenix gas station. I really don't like that but I'm glad I didn't let it deter me from enrolling because the quality here really is exceptional."
4,"First time impression was awesome! Sat down as soon as I walked in, the server came right over and asked me what I'd like to drink and if I know what i want already! They must have a lot of regulars that come her for a quick good meal and go. Great business. I ordered the special, whatever it was it was fantastic. Fries were yummy and crunchy. Everything is great here, I look forward to being a regular. It's super close to my company's office!"
4,"Keep hearing great stuff about this place.  So, today I am going.   I will see if I have to change by review after I eat there,\n\nMade it there and it was worth it.  Great fish and chips and peppersauce burger for the son.  We will be back."
2,"Whataburger are one of the well known fast food in this area and this is really a messy one.\n\nI want to acknowledge first their service! I can give them 5 star for that but their service is not all that I came here for. Its their food and their service but the food has the biggest factor here.\n\nThe burger I ordered was really messy, dont know how the hell did it become that messy. I guess the kitchen staff need a little training on cleanliness on their food.\n\nThe 5 star service that I wanna give is for the Counters. For the food its 1. My final Rating would be 3 star."
0,"I like to stay at Hilton Hotels, because I have an expectation for accommodations that are a little more upscale.  Well, skip this one.  In all the hotels I've stayed in this was the WORST mattress.  Didn't sleep at all.  I would have been better off going out to my car for sleep.  The room was what you'd expect in a less expensive place....old thin linens, furniture that needed to be replaced badly.  Then there was the restaurant.  I'd traveled all day and decided to go pick up a sandwich at the restaurant.  I figured they could do the least amount of damage to a club sandwich.  I got to my room....couldn't even eat it.  The white bread (not toasted, but totally dried out was also MOLDY.  There was no mayo on it, not that I would have eaten it if there was.  Yuk.  I fly out of Sky Harbor often, but will NOT try this hotel again!!"
0,"Staff was like they did not want us there..\n\nwe had a golf tournament there this weekend-\n\nWe had a group of 9 foursomes, so 36 players, we have played there for 10 years. They had 1 server for 39 breakfast, the gal was nice and did her best but the management was so very unprepared.. some of the group waited an hour for their food, and never got food because we had to go tee off.. \n\nPlayed came off course and was kicked out because they had a wedding behind us.. Literally told to leave, The management was so disrespectful to everyone in our group.  I have been in the hospitality business for about 20 years and have never seen anything like this.. \n\n\nThis comes with my strongest recommendation not to come here and play."
3,"I'm sorry, only 2-Stars for LIttle Caesar's Pizza?  I just can't let that go by.  A friend & I dropped in to this location a couple of days ago & each ordered an \""Ultimate Supreme\"" pizza, at only $8 each for a large, \""Hot & Ready!\"".  Friends, it got home still hot, & it was DELICIOUS!!  Was it as good as a $20 pizza at your favorite place in the Valley?  Maybe not, but I bet it was 80% as good for 40% of the price!  After eating half, it also reheated well (in the toaster oven, not the microwave) for a couple of snacks the next day.\n\nI strongly assert that the pizza here is better than that at Papa John's, Pizza Hut, Numero Uno or Dominoes, the primary competitors (who all actually charge somewhat more).\n\nNeed to spend less?  Pepperoni pizza, only $5 for a large=3 Stars.  Cheap & good!  When you don't feel like paying $20 for your pizza, THIS is your place, folks!\n\nFun fact:  I'm an old Vietnam Vet (managed to survive 3 tours over there without ending up with the beard, shopping cart, dog, & cardboard sign!).  Do you know that Little Caesar's bends over backwards to help Vets become franchise holders, even if they are short on money?  This is a class place people, & I hope you'll try them next time.  Get the $8 pizza if it fits your budget.  Yeah for Little Caesar's Pizza!!"
2,"After updating my driver's license photo on a Friday morning (because that's how I spice up my vacation week), I wanted to eat somewhere outside of my general dining zone. By chance, I happened upon El Mesquite and was pleased with my breakfast. My server brought out chips and salsa; man, their salsa kicks ass! Great flavor and fantastic heat. That held me over while I was waiting on the chilaquiles. As others have stated, the beans are on the runny side. But mixing them with rice fixes that.\n\nThe staff here was super nice, too. And for the prices, I'll definately be back when i find myself on the south side."
3,"nice place to get grocery and gas, its a convenient neighborhood grocery store in south phx"
4,T-Bone steak ride was wonderful!  Horses are beautiful and well cared for!
2,Unique experience but don't get suckered into the ride at night and then T Bone dinner at a cabin in the desert. The cabin is a restaurant behind a neighborhood that is ok but not worth the $50 you will spend for two people.
0,"Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place, and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites, could not wait all day!!"
0,"\""I guess nothing is ever as good as you remember it\""\n-Marge Simpson\nUnfortunately, I tend to forget why Gino's pizza is the most awful pizza place in Arizona.\n\nAbout every four years I forget that they use the world's worst watered down sauce, synthetic tasting, plastic-like cheeses and toppings, and a crust that seems to only consist of equal portions of flour and water. That leads to forcing myself into a journey that reminds me that this place is a poor excuse for a pizza parlor.\n\nIt's clear this place has a steady stream of customers, (the owner flaunts an ever changing sports car out front of the restaurant). How else could he afford to drive nice vehicles? That leads me to believe that there are like-minded saps who make a residual journey every few years to find out why it's been so long since there last visit.\n\nOn a positive nod to nostalgia, they still have the same arcade games I fed quarters to as a child. That tends to bring a lighter side to each visit.\n\n\nIt is very clear that this is the worst pizza (find out for yourself!), but at least you can always rely on the on that consistency."
1,"I have heard many good things about this place and then saw mixed reviews on Yelp.  Bill Clinton even ate here.  (I don't think George Washington slept here!  You east coasters will get the joke.)\n\nMy overall opinion is that Poncho's is a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.\n\n- my server was very nice and attentive (except for refilling my water) but the kitchen was very slow\n\n- the chips were fresh but still very greasy\n\n- the Pollo Fundido, one of their signature entrees was a good sized but soggy chimichanga with lots of moist chicken stuffed inside it.  It was then drowned in a white cream cheese jalape\u00f1o sauce.  All very salty to me.\n\n- I ordered rice and beans that we're okay at best.  I know they are refried beans but these were also greasy.\n\nBottom line - with over 20+ Mexican restaurants within a few miles of here I will continue trying new ones vs returning here.\n\nSorry Poncho's!"
2,"I think that Myles and Kristin already said a lot of what you need to know about this sketchy-looking but oh-so-handy-to-have-nearby Chinese place, so I'll just hammer out the highlights:\n\n-Closed Mondays \n-Delivery area goes from 34th Street (E) to 35th Ave (W) and 1-17 (N) to Dobbins (S). Do note, though, that we live off of 19th Ave south of Dobbins (about 1 mile south of the southernmost boundary of the delivery zone) and they said that they would deliver to us without a problem, so definitely still try if you're just outside of the zone. \n-There is a $12 pre-tax minimum for delivery \n-Food is decent quality for the price and not as greasy as one would expect\n-Paper menus have some decent coupons on them. Best one gives you 10 free crab puffs or 3 free egg rolls with purchase of $15 or more\n-Lunch specials are ridiculously cheap (from $3.50 - $4.50 for entree and rice; $4.15 to $4.88 for entree, rice, egg roll, and crab puff) and are served until 3:30 pm\n\nDefinitely not worth driving to if you don't live in South Phoenix. However, if you do live in South Phoenix, this is a cheap and reliable Chinese dine-in, pick-up, and delivery place."
3,"Decent food, when in the mood for Chinese I go here. Sometimes I even have it delivered. Food is good and service is great."
3,"I have been very impressed with Dr. Yocham and the entire staff at Southside Animal Hospital. My dog Lucy has a tendency to be very timid around new people and he has always done his best to make her feel comfortable and calm. He also is very affordable. It is a breath of fresh air to take a dog to a vet and not be reccommended expensive medications and multiple follow up visits. \n\nWhen Lucy was exposed to Parvo I called a local vet who wanted $30 just to walk in the door and have a discussion with me, not satisfied with this I brought her to Dr. Yocham. He explained that since she was current on her vaccinations she was in no danger. He told me to monitor her behavior and explained all the sign to watch for. This visit was free of charge. \n\nHe won my trust on that visit and I have taken her back to him for all her vaccinations. They do not make appointments for visits so there can be quite a wait at times, but his caring and a dedication radiates in his work. I would reccomend him for any of your four legged family members."
3,"Totally can not talk crap about this place. There was no line today at all, food is very tasty and fresh, service is nice. Quite interesting experience if you have not been there and absolutely worth checking out.\n\nNot 5 starts for price and upkeep - i feel both cold be somewhat better.\n\n\""I like\""\n\nEugene"
2,"If you go at the right time of the yr everything is in bloom and it is soo pretty. I went there the first time and ate the french toast which is amazing!,\n\nNow heres were they lost a star. I ate breakfast there and I got egg whites and some other stuff. I went back to my hotel, about 3 hours later I had the 2nd worste food poisoning. I was in the bathroom the whole day and couldnt leave the next day for check out. I in no way could drive back w/o using a bathroom in 5 mins.\n\nI lost about 5 lbs so they earned that star back ;)"
2,The ambience and the setting is awsome but i expected a lot more from the food.  Came out slighlty on the cool side so by the time I was finishing my plate it was warm at best.  We had breakfast but i will be going back to try their lunch and dinner.
2,"\u00a1Ol\u00e9!  Stopped in here this morning for, of course, the BUFFET!  :-))  Today it was featuring 20 or so tasty breakfast treats, which is more than you'll have room for.  I had a big bowl of delicious pozol\u00e9 this time, along with some chorizo & eggs, some other fancy scrambled eggs, home fries, a taquito, a sausage patty, & a couple of warm corn tortillas.\n\nIf you haven't been here, this comfy cafe serves 100% home style Mexican food, & they really know what they're doing.  The buffet is served up cafeteria style (kind of a minus), but they're not afraid to give you a good helping of whatever you ask for.\n\nSaturday & Sunday Breakfast Buffet $5.99 - Served from about 9 AM to Noon.  Yum!"
0,"Ok ,,,, I haven't been to this restaurant in about three years I went back thinking it was going to be the same O same O(which I loved) it turned out to be a very big disappointment;( won't be back plus they were rude"
4,"I love this location.  The staff is always awesome and super friendly, especially at night :)  Out of the Taco Bell's I've been to in Phoenix, this is definitely my favorite for that very reason."
0,First time going here. Horrible service. Wouldn't recommend anyone going here. I was told two ppl would do my micros n it would take 5 hours at the most but only one person braided my hair and it took nearly 8 hours. The braiders were rude and didnt even acknowledge my presence except when they asked me to pay. It was the most uncomfortable 8 hours I've experienced while getting my hair braided.
4,"The smoky smell of grilled chicken lured me in from downtown phx. The chicken is grilled over fire and the style is truly \""Sinaloa.\"" The chicken comes with rice, beans, a grilled jalape\u00f1o,  tortillas, and a small side salad. The beans and rice taste home made and the chicken is delicious."
2,"I wish I could write some original witty review, but I have to repeat whats been said before.  It's super cheap, there is absolutely no decor, the lunch special was enough for me to take home as dinner as well, it was fun reveling in a ridiculously value-saturated lunch with 4 strangers.  Egg roll sucks and egg drop soup fairly bland, but entree was fine and surprisingly the fried rice and kung pao chicken were not too greasy.  Definitely will become a weekly lunch spot!"
0,"We spent months with our child in the 2s and 3s class & we had many concerns. I wrote an email to the 2 teachers. I praised them for their dedication & effort. I also expressed our concerns. After so much time spent with the 2 teachers, I had grown to admire, respect, and like them both. They never returned my email or talked to me again. We got an email from the director who, despite our time in the classroom, dismissed all of our concerns and disinvited our son from the school. This was very painful and unexpected. But it was the best thing for him. We got him into a play based school & helped toilet train, & provided food, & was cheaper, & had better hours, & had fewer holidays . I heard the teacher is now teaching older kids which I think is a better fit for her skills. The staff & faculty, parents, grounds are nice, & the kids are great. But it is not a good value, very friendly to working parents, & has too many holidays. Love & Logic is not for us. I don't know if it was a culture of pride that interfered with their ability to discuss my concerns. But the idea that they are beyond criticism was arrogant & cost them a great kid, committed parents, & a favorable review."
2,"I was super excited to go to South Mountain Park because:\n\nA: it's really close to where I live\nB: it had all these great reviews\nC: I wanted to start hiking and I thought this was a great place to start\nD: my roommates had a map of the park on the fridge about the various trails, so I felt like I knew where to go/what to do \n\nSo I put in the address from Yelp into the GPS, and I passed by a ranger station, but once I passed that I didn't really see any other parking lots to pull into. I didn't see an area and kept driving up the mountain. Finally, we reached a lot, and found where a trail started. \n\nIt just seemed more difficult that I thought it would be. I would try going again, but alas summer is here."
3,What a truly amazing view and ride through that mountainside! I will recommend this place to anyone that ends up in the area. It is something to see for sure
1,"I sort of kind of really really wanted to like this park, but pulling in it clearly was going to be the lesser of all Phoenix 'mountains.' \n\nIt's not a big place and in some places it's littered with garbage and broken bottles, I even saw a dirty diaper. Listen, there is nowhere in the world that anyone wants to see a dirty diaper, FYI. I don't even want to see it in a garbage can, much less in the middle of NATURE. \n\nThere is also a horse corral near so you get that lovely aroma along with hoof prints everywhere. It gets more peaceful and beautiful the higher up you get, but I was even sort of discouraged from HIKING by one of the riding guys. I thought those hills were for hiking. Apparently not.\n\nIt can be pretty, it's easy to hike and there are a lot of pretty rocks, but if you want something that will take your breath away you might want to go to Camelback or Superstition, etc."
4,Great Service! Reliable and friendly. I just needed a new headlight installed and they were quick and accurate! The price is right ;) I will go back!
0,"Don't forget anything on the table, the staff will steal it! Hope the busser enjoys the new Oakley's! The 12 year old hostesses have trouble seating and communicating with guests! For a second I thought they were gonna pass me a note and make me check yes or no if a booth was ok! And don't address the manager about anything substantial, as long as his high school staff thinks he's a cool boss, his self esteem will be neutralized! A little adult interaction might do him good!"
0,"Could be the most inefficient operation.  They had one guy moving cars and four other guys standing around. Took over an hour to get a wash, and that included no vacuum as well."
1,"I don't understand how this rates so high.\n As other reviewers have said, this is not good sushi. It's edible (thus the 2 star rating), but it's not great. I have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and each time I've been only mildly satisfied. They do not serve real crab, their rolls fall apart, and the service is not that great. Maybe I'm going at the wrong time? I have been there during lunch time each time I've gone and have not been impressed at all. On the 3rd try, my friend and I decided that we would not be returning any more."
0,"I think I would like to try the Sakana that everyone else is reviewing because I surely could not have been at the same place... \n\nFinding high quality sushi in the Phoenix area has been a challenge for me as most of the places I get referred to are a bit too \""Americanized\"" for my liking. Sakana is thou the worst offender of doing this. My husband and I went the other evening and ordered what we thought were 7 different rolls...nope-they all tasted the same. \nFake \""krab\"" minced up and doused in mayo- minced tuna..again doused in mayo-and what didn't have mayo had cream cheese or was deep fried-ick. \n\nEven when asking the waitress what was in the rolls (we like to try different things) she at no time said \""krab salad\""-she just said crab...so when I get rolls that have this stick all minced up with mayo you can certainly understand my frustration. The head chef came over and apologized-however stated that it was their \""style\"" and that's how most of the rolls are. \nDinner was atrocious and you leave here with your clothes reeking of oil due to the teppan bar that they have. So money wasted on something I could have done myself with a jar of Hellmans and a package of VandDeKamp Krab and additional money wasted on a dry cleaning bill. \nSave your palette and your money and go elsewhere if you are looking for good, clean, sushi. If you like all the mayo & cream cheese rolls then this is your spot."
0,"My family and I have been dining at Sakana on Elliot for at least a decade and for the most part, have been very satisfied with our experiences. In fact, we would call it one of our \""go-to\"" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was \""borderline\"" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer."
4,"This is my favorite sushi spot.  The price is right, the staff is friendly, the sushi is pretty darn good and the ambiance is nice and cozy.  Great for a date, or even just lunch.  I can walk out full and sakied up for 20 bucks!"
2,"I randomly get the worst sushi cravings known to man, so I found Sakana on Yelp and decided to check it out. We got there for happy hour, and obviously that means it's going to be busy, I get it. We walk up to the hostess and let her know there will be 2 of us. She responds, \""It's going to be at least 30 minutes until there's going to be a table, so...\"" This is normally where said hostess would put your name on the list and tell you to have a seat, but this girl just blankly stared at us like they didn't use the crazy advanced technology known as a waiting list, which requires crazy things like a computer, or even paper and a pen. We awkwardly looked at each other for a few seconds, until I finally said, \""That's fine...can you put my name on the list?\"" She actually responded, \""Oh, you want to wait?\"", as if no one in their life ever waits for a meal at a restaurant. ...Darling, what is the purpose of the chairs in that little area in the front of the restaurant if not for waiting? I've never had a strong urge to eat my dinner there while people waltz in and out from dinner. She then asked us if we wanted to sit down immediately at a \""shared table\"", which I thought might be something similar to the tables at Benihana - but no, it was literally a table we would have to share with two people already sitting having their dinner. Nothing says romantic date like 2 randos coming over with the hostess and sitting down to eat dinner with ya! We declined and waited however long it took, then went back to our own table. The food was pretty good - not the best sushi I've had, but certainly not the worst, a little overpriced even with happy hour and most of my review was just based off of how completely inept the hostess was, but I won't punish the food. :)"
2,"It's always a good sign when you arrive at a restaurant 5 minutes before it opens and there's already customers tugging at the door trying to get in.\n\nIf you purchase a large Kirin beer, you can add an appetizer for $1. We tried the calamari tempura, which was pretty good. I liked the light tempura batter, and the fry on the calamari and accompanying jalapenos was good. We also had the edamame, which were a little undergone to me. Still, everything was such a great price that you can't complain too much.\n\nThe Sakana lunch special is a really good value - big plate of sushi and rolls for $10. A friend and I split this, along with 2 additional rolls. The fish portions were good, and I thought the rolls were very fair for the price. Alaska roll was nice, as was the Mexican caliente roll.\n\nPortions were generous, so we weren't able to finish everything even after indulging ourselves into a food coma. For the lunch prices, I think Sakana was good. I'm not sure if I would stop in for dinner, but if I'm in the area again for lunch, I might stop in."
2,"This sushi restaurant has fresh fish and is the best I've found for a reasonable price in the valley (This coming from an east coast foodie who LOVES sushi.) However, the service is bad more often than it is good and NEVER go here in a hurry. I've never made it out of there in less than an hour. Once I went in there and asked for an itemized check, it took them 25 minutes to bring the check back AND it still wasnt itemized. In fact, I still don't know what it was. I love their sushi but its about time for me to find a new sushi restaurant after how many times I've had waitresses be rude and even ignore me. \n\nTheir redeeming quality that kept me coming back so long was their happy hour prices Sunday-Thursday. Its a lot of sushi for a small cost. So if you have plenty of time and don't mind a bad waiter or two check it out!"
0,"It has been two years since we've been to this location.  We stopped coming because the service was horrendous, the food was mediocre, and overall the experience took way too long.  Why did we think anything had changed? It hasn't.  Today we were here for nearly two hours!  That's two hours of my life I'll never get back!  And it wasn't an enjoyable two hours!  We asked for Splenda multiple times.  Splenda never came.  We finally asked a manager who brought the Splenda.  Refills were slow which is a shame.  If you are going to make me wait forever for my food you could at least keep the tea glass filled.  When the food finally did come, three plates arrived and two of us had to wait another 10 minutes.  Once the food arrived our waitress immediately dropped the bill.  Really?  No problem.  We will gladly get out and not be back!  Can't believe two years have gone by and they still haven't figured this out!"
3,Some days on the way to work I will make a stop here... I order the same thing The Southwestern bagel sandwich it's always really good I would say split it with someone it's really a lot of food plus it comes with a cup of fresh fruit... It's a good start to a day I would say.
3,Yummy bagel sandwiches for lunch. I had the BLT and was pleasantly surprised to have plenty of perfectly done bacon on my sandwich. Flavor was great. My husband got southwestern bagel sandwich and it had a great flavored spread and also tons of meat. It took about 8-10 min to have our sandwiches prepared so I wouldn't recommend if you're in a hurry. I'm not sure if it always takes this long.
1,"My first time at this location, and if the food weren't actually pretty good, I would have rated it a one.\n\nWe visited during a lunch hour on Saturday, and I wouldn't have thought the amount of business justified a waiter taking literally a few minutes to get our drink order. In fact, I think ours was the only table in the section with customers seated. I was tolerant of this initial slowness thinking it would get better from there, but it never did. Every step required an extended wait right up to getting my check. The waiter didn't even check in on us while we were eating. When I got up to go to the bathroom after the check had been presented suddenly the waiter was there to get his money. And this is the ONLY time I've been asked for my ID with my credit card at a restaurant. \n\nSome might defend that as a necessary and even nice security step given the world we live in today, etc. But if left a bad taste in my mouth. A restaurant shouldn't be doing this. I had just spent over $100 for a dinner and drinks in a far nicer place in Denver, and wasn't asked for an ID.\n\nSo overall, a decent place with good food who needs to manage their help a lot better, and stop asking for ID from customers paying with credit cards."
4,Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well.
3,This is a decent place to enjoy a couple glasses of wine and some nosh with a friend.  I would give it five stars but I'm rather turned off by the inside seating area.  This place is best when you can sit outside in cool weather.  Especially around sunset =)\n\nOccasionally they do have live music playing outside which adds to the ambiance of the dimly lit evenings.  A relaxing atmosphere that I think is a must to enjoy =)
2,"We use to love this place, but the food - value ratio is on the decline. We had the thin crust pizza and it tasted like crackers with red sauce. We enjoy the live music and warm tea on the patio at sunset, but it has changes so much. I am not sure if we will give it another try, very disappointed."
4,"I absolutely love this place. I have been twice and Katie (bar manager) has been my server both times...she is great! She recommended the bacon/Squash flatbread and it was outstanding! The wine was great, and even greater on HH (which, btw their HH is from open to 6pm M-S. They are not open before 3pm though, so don't try going here for lunch...it's a chill, nighttime place to bring dates or close friends/family members.\n\nOn weekends, there is always an acoustic musician playing. I have experienced Blaine Long and Notes from Neptune. Both phenomenal. \n\nLong story short...if you read my reviews you know I like chill spots with great lighting and patios. This is another one of those....I will be back for a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc time.\n\n:)"
3,"Went here for happy hour with my mom and sister. Was greeted by the humans right campaign sticker on the front door which immediately put a smile on my face. We stuck to ordering a lot of drinks and appetizers that were on happy hour menu. They had a free appetizer for checking in which you can't argue with either. \n\nLots of drinks to order from. Appetizers were amazing, service was great, always came back to check if we wanted more drinks or food. The only reason I docked one star was because the server assumed that my sister was my mom and that my mom was my grandma. It's a common mistake to make, but something no one should ever assume. \n\nOverall, I definitely recommend!"
4,Staff is excellent and knowledgable.  Flatbread was fantastic.  Very cute and great atmosphere.
1,Overpriced and overhyped food. Last time turned around at the door due to the smell and waiting line.....
0,Feeling generous with the one star today. Food was good but service was lacking. I don't believe that you should have to wait 30-40minutes for water to arrive at your table or watch your appetizer pot steam for that long either.  The bad service outweighed the food this time. Disappointed. Seems like the Melting Pot should read some of these reviews to make improvements.
2,"Food was pretty good.  Server was friendly, but we had a difficult time understanding his accent.  Normally OK, but unfortunate here since there is more waiter-interaction than normal.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor in this place was a bit dilapidated.  When we arrived, we weren't sure if we were at the right door because there was no sign, and the main entrance looked like the paint was fading (so we thought it might have been a service entrance).  Inside, there were dark booths with the wood stain on the walls coming off probably from the steam that the fondue pots produce.  The black napkins had some white lint on them.  \n\nThe waiter recommended a \""garlic and wine\"" seasoning be sprinkled on the wedge salad.  It was in a large plastic style spice bottle like you would find at the grocery store.  Not classy at all, and it didn't taste very good either (luckily I just sprinkled a little into my hand and onto a small part of the salad because it came out pretty fast).\n\nFor the price ($170 after tip and 2-3 drinks each) we expected better service and a more pristine environment."
3,Great happy hour specials! They also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to they're facebook fans.
4,Our visit was the climax to a wonderful eveing out and the staff were so awesome in describing their menu and how it all worked.
4,"We came here for my wife's Birthday.  It was my first experience at The Melting Pot and it was a great one.  We were greeted upon walking in and seated right away.  They seated us in a small private booth for two which was very nice.  Each of the booths has a curtain that they pull shut so you feel like you are all alone.  There was only a \""dull roar\"" from the other guests in the restaurant, so it was very nice.  \n\nOur server was excellent.  She was outgoing and very helpful in explaining the menu.  We got the cheese and chocolate fondue with a salad.  All three courses were great.  We had the cheddar fondue which you can't go wrong with.  The different varieties of bread that we dipped in the fondue with delicious. My wife and I both got the house salad, hers with ranch and I got mine with the house dressing.  My dressing was sweet and the salad was very good. I would probably try it with ranch next time as ranch is my go-to dressing.  We finished off with the chocolate fondue which was amazing.  It had strawberries, rice-crispy treats, marshmallows, etc.  Dessert was the best course of the meal.  \n\nIt was a little on the pricey side for us, but a great choice for special occasions and well worth it!  It may be my choice for my Birthday dinner later this year :)"
4,"I had the lunch special. My service was excellent and both the half tuna melt, which my server recommended, and the green salad were delicious, far exceeding my expectations for a bar and grill. The house-made blue cheese dressing was also great. Plus it was cheap at $6.95. They also had free Wi-Fi and some craft beers on tap."
4,"Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!"
3,Decent food. We ordered cod fish tacos and salmon with quinoa which was listed as lifestyle menu. My entree side was kale salad which was not my favorite. Drinks were good and service was nice but slow.
4,"What a great Law Firm. They were willing to help and answered all my questions. I had legal questions and didn't know who to call. When I started looking for a lawyer and called other offices, I couldn't get one on the phone. When I called this law firm, I got all my questions answered and this team really cares. I highly recommend them!"
2,"I have been to Mimi's several times and at many different locations around the valley. I enjoy going there for breakfast as I am not a huge fan of their lunch selections. I love their Mixed Berry Pain Perdu, which is stuffed french toast, their turkey sausage is very good as well and lets not forget their Sunrise Pomosa to wash it all down with! While I am a fan of their breakfast I will have to say that it didn't matter which Mimi's location I was at they definitely lack in service, our waiter/waitress was rarely around and if you needed refills on your drinks you had to flag down another employee just to have them ask your waiter/waitress for you. Overall its a place to go for breakfast when you are not in hurry!"
1,Read in the paper this location has closed! It was a decent place to eat at the handful of times I went there. Hope something good goes in its place fast.
1,"Im not the biggest fan of this store.  The diapers and everyday items seem to be a lot more expensive here.   We did buy some bigger ticket items like a car seat, and a few other things.  Some of the kids seats and bean bags they have were very dirty and almost looked used while they kept their overpriced new price on them.   It seems hit or miss if you get an employee that is happy to be there or not.  Not a big fan of this store"
3,Just makes your day better when you have friendly service and a yummy bagel!
2,"I never been to Sweet Tomatoes despite being extremely close to our house. Every time I drive by , it looks packed. Today I went with a friend and my son for lunch. I had a coupon, it was 20 something including drinks for both of us.  The drinks are definitely overpriced, the buffet at less than $8.00 was a decent value. I agree with a previous reviewer, the toppings for the salad were very basic, kind of disappointing. To their credit, everything looked and tasted fresh. The prepared salads were good, I'm pretty sure very high in calories as well. I had the potato leek soup, which was nothing to write home about. But.... this month they have chicken pot pie stew, you pour this on top of a biscuit and that was sooooo gooood. I'm surprised I liked it since I don't even like chicken pot pie, but the stew was nicely seasoned, the veggies were good and the biscuits were light and fluffy. Comfort food at it's best. \nThe breads were OK, and the muffins were tasty. The pasta didn't looked appetizing to me at all, except the mac & cheese that my toddler devoured. Granted, at this age I don't think they're the best judges of good food, not to mention mac & cheese is a group food on its own for them.\nThe fruit section was very sparse, only whole apples and pineapples slices. \nIn general, unless you eat a lot, buffets are not a great value but a $10 lunch here will leave you satisfied, if you're not big into meat that is. I know that I need to come back for more chicken stew and biscuits."
2,"So I have been a sweet tomatoes fan since I was in high school. It definitely has problems, but ever since all of the souper salads around us closed this has really been our only option for a salad buffet. \n\nFirst off, the prices are really high but they give coupons away like crazy. I get an email pretty much every week, and they are all over the newspapers....just lower the prices already!!! Even with the coupons the price of a meal for a family is much too high for the food that you get, which brings me to my huge problem with the place. Why is there no meat for the salads? Even souper salad had ham and turkey and their prices were much, much lower. \n\nThe dessert options are laughable, it's usually oranges and some jello. It reeks of no effort at all and looks sorry. They do offer ice cream but I'm not a fan. Some other options would be appreciated. The service is usually very good and the warm cookies that are brought around are usually delicious. \n\nIf Sweet Tomatoes added meat to their menu and lowered the prices, I would be there more often. I don't foresee this happening but it's nice to dream. BTW I am so glad that this place didn't turn into that \""Field Kitchen\"" chain that they tried with some other locations. That sounded like a disaster."
0,This place is full of incompetent barbers.  I recently went to Joe's for a haircut.  The wait was long but stuck it out.  It was finally my turn to go and the staff bumbled the list and called another gentleman's name before me.  It was clearly on top of his but blatantly skipped.  How can I trust a guy with my hair if he can't read a simple list?
4,Such great service!  Everyone in there is so nice.  My husband bought my engagement ring at Ganem and they are always so helpful whenever I bring it in to get cleaned or buffed.  Great staff & never any pressure to purchase.  The only jewelers we will use from now on.
4,"I must say that I have been blown head over heels with how Clayton and Jordan have impressed me the last few times I've come in to Jamba. First off, they're smiling as soon as I walk through the door. They have memorized my name as well as my entire favorite order!! Also, to top it off we have had some of the best morning conversations to start my day! Five stars guys!! You All Keep Me Coming Back! This is what great service is truly about"
3,"I went to this place after work yesterday around 4:30ish to get a simple pedi. Lady who helped me was nice enough, didn't bother to small talk which was fine with me. She was a little rough when messaging my legs. I got a classic pedi with callus removal, it was the most effective callus removal treatment I have ever had. Classic pedi was $20 plus $5 for the callus removal, price is reasonable, I will return."
0,"I didn't like this place. Red Velvet cake is my favorite, so me and my boyfriend are always trying to find a good one. First of all, this place looks more like a boutique than an actual cake place. Second of all, the Red Velvet didn't even taste like Red Velvet. It just taste like a bland chocolate cake."
4,"I probably will never buy a cake from anywhere else.  I am totally spoiled. I was treated like a Queen, the shop itself is lovely, and the cake??? OMG!!  I've tried two now, and both were beyond delicious. I bought one small one for my husband for our anniversary and another large one for my daughter's birthday.  It didn't just taste amazing, they took such care in wrapping and appearance.  The customer service is the best I've experienced since I've moved here.  Price? I thought it would be along the same line as the cakes I used to buy in KC where I moved from.  Nope, not as much.  The prices are great.  I LOVE this place!!!!"
3,"After a long trip to the nearby Hobby Lobby, I was looking for a treat before my 25 minute drive home.  Nothing Bundt Cakes is conveniently located amist all kinds of shopping. When I walked in I was greeted by a young girl with a smile, who seemed to really want to help me get what I needed.  They had samples of their flavor of the month, which was White Chocolate Blueberry.  Absolutely heavenly!!  I ended up buying 3 of the bundtettes.  Chocolate chocolate chip, white chocolate blueberry, and cinnamon swirl.  I go nuts for anything cinnamon, so that was a front runner for me.  Perfect balance of cinnamon and cake.  Chocolate one was just a little too chocolately for my liking, but moist and tasty nonetheless.  The -1 star is only because I think they are a little pricey.  But for the occasional treat, I won't complain!"
4,I have been here once and tried the red velvet cake and it was great! If only they were open on Sundays too! :)\n\nWill definitely go again.
1,This is an alright place if you haven't experienced some of the much better places in Arizona.  I think it is somewhat overpriced compared to similar restaurants and the food isn't anything to rave about.
1,"Thought was supposed to be HOT, but was'nt more like tooo sweet!!!\nI got the Fireman carnita burrito really was disappointed so far Arizona's Mexican foods is way to BLAND and wife has'nt found any she likes!!!\nThe girl that took my order was nice and polite and the carnita meat tasted good but that's all !!! my 2 star rating is on the high side!!!"
2,"I've been wanting to try Los Taquitos even before I knew it had been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I finally got the chance.  The inside it exactly what I expected, nothing fancy, booths and some tables.  I found it a little odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lids, napkins, condiments and plasticware are right next to it.  If there had been a line it would have been very awkward.  I ordered a chicken burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans and a drink.  When I went to get my drink they were out of Diet Coke, it came out as just water.  Ok, I thought maybe they had been super busy as it was about 1pm on a weekday.  Lunch rush perhaps.  I took a seat and waited for my number to be called.  The burrito was good, nothing that knocked my socks off but a decent burrito.  The rice was nice and fluffly but the beans just lacked flavor.  They were blah.  Will I come back?  Sure but I will try the tacos next time and hope that they can rearrange that counter a bit."
2,Was visiting friends and found this place thanks to Yelp. The food was good but not good enough to warrant 4 stars.
3,Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat.
3,"Great food, good prices, and a good menu. Only downside is the wait is a little long and the place is cramped. Overall a great place for your die hard Mexican food lover."
3,"Love this place!  I have lived in Ahawatukee for many years and have been going to this place for years.  When I think of tacos, I think Los Taquitos.  There carne asada is fresh, well seasoned and flavorful.  Also try their supreme breakfast burrito, it is to die for!  It is high quality and really inexpensive.  It's not a sit down restaurant type of place so you may not want to take a date here.  The drawbacks is the sitting place within the restaurant, you don't have many places to sit and when you order to go, make sure to check your food before you leave.  They have a tendency of missing things in your order or not giving you the things your ordered."
2,"The food is good, but too pricey for a hole in the wall restaurant. This isn't anything special that you wouldn't find at any other mexican place. \n\nWhen I was there a man came and bought a $20 dozen tamales - FROZEN! Who in their right mind pays that much for frozen tamales?"
4,I freaking love this place! Their Arizona Burrito with chicken is amazing! My favorite little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant!
0,Hair cut and price for 2 yorkies poor and it stunk smelled bad
3,This place just might be the home of the best gyro that I've ever tasted. I have weekly cravings for Niro's (which I often give in to) and I live about 20 minutes away! The service is great as it seems that the owners are always at the front register to chat with while you're waiting for your gyro.
4,"I've been going to Niro's for over 5+ years.  I think the gyro is really good.  Being from Chicago, we love our gyro so I'm glad this place is near my home.   If you get the double gyro plate, they give you a lot of meat.  Just wish they would give you 4 pitas since 2 is not enough."
3,I took my little sister here a few weeks ago for the first time.  Seeing how she is only 5 years old I was looking for something we could both do and kill time (summer vacation!).  This place was great.  I made a reservation and everyone on staff was helpful and friendly.  They gave us a start and made sure we were enjoying the experience.\n\nI would definitely return there again.  I've heard this place gets super busy at times and now that it is summer i'm sure it will be more so.  I would recommend making a reservation to make sure you are able to paint.
1,"2 stars based only the delivery experience... \n\nProduct quality is OK that warrants a 3 or 4 star rating however you need to get the product shipped to you and that's where they loose major points! \n\nThey can't give you a good time window for delivery, they call you to confirm in the daytime and call you back after 630 to give you a time window which would be OK but why make the first call when the 2nd call tells you what you really need to know. \n\nYou can't say I want a delivery in the AM or PM, you can't request a time window, they tell you that your delivery is based on your location, they start with the farthest out and work their way back in... problem is that the drivers re-arrange their routes to better suit their needs so in essence you may as well plan on being home from 8am to 8pm because you'll never get lucky enough to have an actual delivery window. \n\nThe flaw in their system is what gives them a low score... fix deliveries and I'd be willing to change the rating. Also to be clear, I've purchased from them several times, the fact that I have an open credit line with them and the quality of the goods is (no pun intended) good, makes me go back but the experience is always soured when I get the person on the phone telling me that it's their way or no way ... so basically you get what you get, stay home all day and hope that it's OK when it's delivered! \n\nSpend less money on TV advertising and ramp up your delivery operations!"
4,Great service!!\n(written on 4/24/2012)
0,"Yuck, really?\n\nI never go to Best Buy, but I went over the weekend to try some laptop comparison shopping with my wife. I just wanted to her try different models and see which ones she liked.\n\nFirst, what are you doing at the door, Guy Standing At The Door? Are you a receipt checker? I can't stand that kind of gestapo B.S. If you are a greeter, and you did greet us, why are you standing at a podium, Richard Dawson?\n\nOnward. They have the laptops arranged by brand... kind of? There are a couple laptops of each brand, but then they have endcaps of laptops or no known reason, and a whole row of \""student\"" laptops for which the criteria is anyone's guess. The \""Apple\"" section is also segregated 20 feet away with curtains, as if to prevent an infiltration of filth from the Windows PCs. \n\nMy wife managed to inspect a couple of the laptops for at least 30 seconds before being jostled aside by an associate trying to get into a storage cage. I marveled at the signs advertising the Geek Squad service of essentially turning on your laptop and uninstalling a couple unwanted apps for like $100. How many people have been suckered into this, I wonder.\n\nThen... there is a Cox Cable guy roaming around? Why am I being accosted by a third-party vendor inside of Best Buy?"
2,This Best Buy is not as new looking as the one by the mall but I feel like the employees here are more knowledgeable and helpful than at the other location.
0,"Went to Best Buy because they were the only ones listed for the replacement keyless entry remote.  Was in the store for 20 minutes.  Never was greeted, never was approached by any team member, even though 5 team members looked right at me.  As I was walking out, a team member was talking to another guy, not sure who he was, but he kept waving me to keep walking.  Then he approached me and said she wasn't talking to you.  I said I know no one is talking to me and I was never asked for help.  If you want customer service NEVER go to a Best Buy.  No wonder they are losing money.  Good bye Best Buy!!!"
0,I will never be back to this Best Buy and would advise everyone else to find a more customer friendly store.
0,"Very disappointed with this shop.  I did buy my bridal gown here which was beautiful, but the experience was definitely not what I had hoped for.  I truly felt like each employee I came across, with the exception of one (I wish I could remember her name) did not want to be at their job.  They pretty much seemed like they would rather be anywhere else.  I felt completely rushed when trying on gowns, which sucks because it's quite a big decision when you are spending that amount of money for a very important day.  Costume jewelry is overpriced, alterations are overpriced.  Go somewhere else.  My friend had her wedding gown altered here and they screwed it up twice!  I don't know how it is at other bridal shops, but I think it's shitty that you are not allowed to return anything- only exchange and it's a crime how long they estimate it will take to get the gown you order, especially considering they are a huge chain!"
0,"Went in to get a dress for my young daughter. Was ignored from start to finish. When I asked if they could see if another store had the dress I wanted, instead of offering to call, they offered to give me the number so I could call. Terrible customer service. I bought my wedding dress here 10 years ago. Will never go back."
4,"Great place to get the things you just can't find at the big chain stores.\nHigh quality pet food, snacks, toys, cloths, and staff that care.\nThe store is small, but well worth the trip.  You won't be disappointed.\nI just moved to the area, and after doing a little research online, I found that this place carried not only the high end food I feed my dog, but also the brand of shoes I wanted to protect my dog's feet from the hot ground here in Phoenix.  I looked some more, and they carry, or deal in just about every high end food on the market, and just about anything worth getting for your dog, and they even have a few items for your feline friend too."
0,Worst printing service I ever had. The employee raped my friend's bank accounts by misquoting them and giving them zero options. We are design students at asu and were very dissatisfied with the overall experience that was offered. I will never bring my business to this location or any other fedex office or junkie locations again.
1,"I thought the whole point of taco bell is its open late. Not 11pm, or a few minutes before. Boo"
4,Eye Priority is a fantastic business - quality and professional eye exams by caring optometrists - fashionable and large selection of frames to choose from coupled with a extremely helpful staff. No better place for prescription eyewear in Ahwatukee!
2,"Unexciting, bland and expensive! \nService was good, if somewhat snobbish. \nFood was nothing special run of the mill bland Italian fair.\n\nAll in all its probably not worth it. Especially for someone like myself who is really not Italian fan. \n\n\""I no like\""\n\nEugene"
1,"The waiter was nice and very friendly tonight. The bread and salad was good. But the linguini and clams was kinda gross. It was nothing new. The sauce tasted plain and the clams were already on the noodles. It's more spontaneous when you can open the clams yourself. The sauce was also really thick. If it was thinner it would have been better. The cheesecake was alright. I've had better and the portion is really small. I looked at it and said are you kidding me? It was like a \""fun size\"" but I was looking for the king size cheesecake. Other than that I don't think I'll be back."
1,"Been here several times.  Food is generally good, happy hour prices could be good if they know how to ring you up.  Depending on who waits on you, you will be charged for drinks you didn't order and the prices will be inconsistent on the check for what you actually order.  3 different prices for the same brand of beer.  I believe this is padding to compensate for the fledgling revenues and dwindling crowd.  Sit at the bar as the service is better.  Careful when you bring up the inconsistencies on the tab as the owner is defensive and condescending.  They should practice consistency.  Long time regulars complain about the shell of this establishment from whatnot was, but come here for convenience.  If you really have a choice, go to Garage across the street.  Good service and act like they appreciate your business."
1,"Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n5 Food\n7 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n6 Value\n\nUpon first walking in it smelled like a Mr. Gatti's.  Now, I love Mr. Gatti's (do any even still exist?), so that's not an insult, except that that smell means to me that I should be getting big food for little money, and that wasn't the case.\n\nI wasn't even expecting that much, and this place failed.  The server was nice enough and well timed though he didn't ask if we'd ever been there before to offer some info.\n\nThen the food came out.  With the exception of a hum-drum tomato sauce on our veggie \""thinbread\"" pizza, the flavors were excellent.  The house dressing on the salad was great, and my European \""deepdish\"" (no tomato sauce) tasted superb.  But let me backup - it's not a deepdish.  AT ALL.  It's a normal pizza with bread walls.  And the thincrust wasn't a thincrust either!!  They were both just normal pizzas.  EPIC FAIL.  Deepdish should require a fork and a knife.  I used my hands, easily.  Therefore I received half the food I was expecting.\n\nOn the upside, they offer half-pitchers of Oak Creek beers, which is a big win.  That and the flavors on my European were all that stood between this place and one less star.  The only people that can possibly rate this place well have never had a real thincrust or deepdish pizza."
3,"I have not been to Nello's in ages.  A friend suggested for lunch.  The three of us show up and the place was getting busy.  We were sat immediately.  Got to have pizza here, right?  We ordered a large pizza:  thick crust, bacon, basil, mushroom, and 1/2 with sausage.  OMG... It was good but they forgot the basil.  =(  The garlic bread was very good too....  \n\nThe waiter was eye candy and he provided great service!  =)"
3,"Go for the thin crust! \n\nOverall experience was wonderful, service was attentive, straight to the point and not smothery. Food at this local pizza joint is high quality you can taste. As a chef dining out for a casual lunch, I left pleased and with cash still in my pocket.\n\nFirst we had the Roasted Eggplant Bruschetta, the baguette was toasted to perfection. The crust was crisp with a nice light sourdough flavor and chew, not over toasted a bit and still tender on the inside. The four baguettes were topped with a beautiful creamy, tangy goat cheese. The eggplant was beautifully roasted and naturally rich in flavor. Sun-dried tomatoes added a nice acid element to this dish, which was served warm with a well balanced Balsamic Reduction. \n\nNext we tried the Smoked Chicken and Broccoli Pizza. The crust, oh gosh. THE CRUST! Perfect. Thin and crunchy, tender, caramelized in the wood burning oven to a perfect golden brown. The smoked chicken was still moist, the broccoli still had a nice bite to it as all vegetables should and had a fantastic roasted flavor. No sauce here, just a little olive oil and garlic went down before the toppings. The Mozzarella and Smoked Provolone were appropriate, but a nice nutty Asiago or Parmesan-Reggiano would have been a welcome touch.  Bacon? Of course we added bacon! An Applewood Smoked Bacon. Although in recent years bacon, and especially Applewood Smoked has been overplayed in the culinary world, Nello's kept it organic in style. The bacon has a wonderful fatty crunch, just the right balance of salt and smoke and cooked just so. The half slabs of thick, delicious bacon were simply laid over our pizza towards the end of cooking. Very pleased this bacon wasn't chopped up into tiny bits. \n\nThe Banana-Nut Bread Pudding was tempting but Tiramisu has my heart. Being half Italian I know Tiramisu and Nello's has made a great play on this classic dessert. First a thick layer of creamy mascarpone was sweetened to not over power the cheese itself. The ladyfinger layer held its integrity and wasn't soaked to the point of sogginess which is a pleasant surprise. Another generous layer of mascarpone and a surprisingly thick dusting of cocoa powder was a great touch. \n\nNello's is worth every penny, the bill for two of us was just over $30.00. We left full and happy, too many dining experiences can be disappointing if the little details are left out. They don't miss a beat! David was a fantastic server with an upbeat attitude, the rest of the staff was also attentive and helpful. Beer and Wine selection is nice as well, there is definitely something for everyone here. \n\nLike Nello's on Facebook, they post special items with fantastic seasonal ingredients that any food lover would get pumped over!  \n\nI will be back time and time again."
1,"Pretty much done with Nello's Ahwatukee...it is now The Parlor - Part II wannabe\n\nThey have killed what used to be really good pizza - NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE there can make a pizza like George used to.\n\nWhat a shame and a perfectly good wood-burning pizza oven being sadly misused.\n\nFlorencia is much better; even Grimaldi's is better - and carryout from Rosati's is WAY better!"
4,"I've lived in Phoenix for a year and have yet to find a pizza place worth talking about (I'm from Chicago...nothing compares).  I decided to give this place a try last night.  It was delicious!  I loved the atmosphere...had an upscale-ish d\u00e9cor but not too yuppie to make you feel uncomfortable for wearing jeans (our server had on a black tee shirt and a baseball cap.  The server was very personable, we never had empty drinks, and knew his way around the menu, which was great, as we had never been there before.  We got the Caprese for an app, and since my bf and I have opposite tastes in pizza, we each ordered our own so we could get what we wanted and have leftovers.  We could tell it was starting to get really busy, and a line was forming out the door, but the server made sure to stop by often, and not make us feel rushed as we sat for a few minutes finishing our beers.  Their ingredients were fresh and more than you can get at most pizza places (an awesome variety of cheeses to choose from, and everything from regular veggies to shrimp or salmon!).  For 2 people our bill ran just under $60, which was totally reasonable for an app, drinks, and 2 pizzas.  I will definitely be returning and recommending to my friends!"
2,"Never been to a Boston Market?  \n\nThey basically have roasted chicken and a variety of sides.  You go up to the front counter and choose what to eat - it's all laid out there in front for you to see.\n\nPay, sit down and eat.\n\nI like roasted chicken - here, it's not too bad.  A little better flavor than your hot roasted chicken that you'd find at your supermarket.\n\nThe sides are pretty good, too.  Not great, it should hit the spot.\n\nI'll never forget how one pecular employee at one particular location welcomed me as I walked into the door - he hollered \""Welcome to BM!\""  I won't tell you what type of grin I had while eating my lunch."
1,"Pretty good happy hour. Not very authentic sushi. I hate people who think the can say they \""LOVE RA\"" but the only thing they get are the California rolls. If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi- stay away. Fun atmosphere, pretty good service, cheap happy hour, but I've def had better sushi."
2,"I've only been to this Ra once or twice, but I think the price is overestimated here.  Maybe people are having too much Sake.  The service is decent, ambiance is very faux Japanese-American deal.  Sushi is pretty good and if you go during happy hour it's a steal.  Sake and Kirin is like 3 or 4 bucks and you can get a thing of Sake for $1.  They have a nice patio sitting area to people watch. Great place if you want to catch a friend for lunch or do dinner and a movie."
1,"I visit this spot for the Happy Hour.   3-7pm.  \n\nThe Viva Las Vegas Roll is pretty delicious & fancy if made right.  Sometimes, I've had it look like a disaster during Happy Hour.  Other times, it looks like a work of art.  it depends how busy they are.   But always tastes decent.\n\nThe music in the restaurant is uncomfortably loud & dark.  On permanent night club setting.  Whenever I see little kids eating here, I question their parents' decisions.\n\nEven during Happy hour, their drinks are expensive.  I always go home disappointed by their cocktails... even with the discount... because they're just not good.  Stick with beer.\n\nAll in all, mehh... if you're really hard up for somewhere to go, it's an experience."
1,Food is barely average and going down hill fast. Service is not great but they try. But they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while. Gross.
0,"After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment."
3,"This place has the best gourmet shrimp, bacon & avocado tacos!!! YUM"
1,"My husband works out at this Golds and I stopped by to change the card we have on file and make a change to my membership. The girl at the front desk was rude and seemed miserable. I asked a few questions about our membership (for example: Will the next payment for sure come out of the new card?) and every time she responded with \""I don't know, I just work the front desk.\"" For being the first person everyone interacts with when they walk in, I feel like Golds Gym should be making sure their guests have a pleasant experience and should inform their \""front desk\"" employees how to answer what I thought were simple questions."
1,"I can tell you they don't clean the equipment much at all, most of the staff is not helpful and bullshits too much, I have stood at the counter waiting while they talk, the tanning beds are down to one bed and is filthy, if they have time to BS they should clean the equipment, most of the equipment is older and not very well taken care of, the management should really do something, also busy and small, the golds I used to go to in a different state was excellent so not sure what the problem is here"
0,"How the Mighty have fallen , service is pure crap"
0,"When I tried to print off the tickets I had purchased on the day of the concert my wife and I planned to attend, Ticketmaster tried to force me to change my account's password \""...as part of our ongoing security enhancements\"". They were holding my tickets hostage until I did so. \n\nI was redirected to a page that stated I had been sent an email with a temporary password. It never arrived. I tried to call their 800 number and continuously got a busy signal. My account userid and password were locked once they \""sent\"" the email that never came.\n\nBottom line: No tickets. No Concert. Loss of $300. \n\nTicketmaster is a monopoly and they show all the earmarks of one, from their artificially inflated fees to their lousy ticketing software to their shoddy \""customer service\""."
3,"This place is truly a \""compound,\"" with multiple buildings of hotel room suites, 6 pools, a few restaurants, and an entire waterpark.  It takes a lot of walking to get around, but if you can find your way back to the main lobby, they will shuttle or golf cart you wherever you'd like to go.  The staff is friendly  and they have big baskets of lollipops in the lobby, which was cute.\n\nMy suite was bigger than some apartments I've lived in for years.  It was clean, quiet, and nicely appointed.  It did smell of smoke, but didn't keep me from sleeping soundly or enjoying my time there.  My work pals tell me that local families stay here sometimes just to use the waterpark.  Sounds like fun to me!"
0,"I am actually writing this review from my room at the hotel now.\n\nVery disapointed in this place.  My wife and I have been here for a week and even with the deal I got on our room I feel like I've overpaid.  In fact the only good thing about this place so far is that it was cheap.\n\n- Rooms are old and dirty.  I was told that some of the rooms have been renovated and are nice but not the room that we were given thats for sure.  Stains all over the carpets, bird droppings all over the balcony and balcony furniture.  Pretty gross.  Not to mention both the TVs were small, old and unwatchable which was actually a problem seeing how none of the pools were worth going to but more on those later.\n\n- Maid service was horrible and non-existant.  We have been for 5 days and have maid service only three times.  On the second time we happened to come back to our room while the maid was still there, she locked herself in our room and had both TVs on a spanish soap opera and was visibly annoyed that we wanted in to our room.  She didn't even \""clean\"" the room and simply changed out the towels and made the bed.  Bags for ice (the ice bucket was too dirty to use without one) were never replenished, garbage on top of the mini-bar was never removed and room service trays were not being picked up.  Our breakfast trays sit outside in the hot Arizona sun until the next morning when our new breakfast is delivered.  The plus side of this is that we had an entertaining bird fight outside our room last night.\n\n- Pools.  So they charge a 30$/day resort fee.  The theory here is that the 30/day gives us full access to the water park, pools, gym etc. which is a great idea although the water park is closed during the week, the gym is ok but the other pools... DISGUSTING.  More bird droppings everywhere and garbage in the water.  There is a pool that advertises a swim up bar.. sure there is something that looks like a bar.. but no alcohol or even an attendant to serve you.  Some of the pools have a phone you can use to order from a limited menu but they can't even get basic orders right.\n\n- Room Service.  Very limited menu and as with most places overpriced.  This plus they seem to not understand basic instructions like \""do not toast my sandwhich please\"".  My wife -- after THREE times asking for it to be made right finally gave up and just ate it as it was.\n\nThis place does have potential but apparently they are understaffed and those that do work here do not seem to care and it really needs updating and cleaning.\n\nWould not stay here again."
1,"I wouldnt call this a premiere resort. The suite was small, and needed a major update to compete with other area resorts, ie. Tube television. The bathroom was very small and in one of our rooms was missing toilet paper and a working lock. The grounds looked like they needed a major paint job and some pruning of plants.  I had a lovely view of the highway, but luckily the noise was not a problem. On the upside, the kids enjoyed thw waterpark, but at times the lazy river and slides were closed. There was confusion over the opening times on Sat, which left our girls frustrated. If you are looking for a focus on kids waterpark, okay grounds and room, this will work for you.  If you are more interested in an overall resort experience, go to the Fairmont Princess."
1,"This is a hard review to write. So I'll need to rate it on several different criteria:\n\nThe good:\nHotel lobby & rooms: very beautiful, spacious and well appointed. Our family of 4 enjoyed the layout. Very much like an upgraded embassy suites - which works great for a family of 4! The valet people couldn't have been nicer.\n\nOn-site Water park - yay! 2 tall slides, a lower loopy slide (my fave) a lazy river and a wave pool. Free towels, plenty of shade, and decent chair service. Plus a good amount of self serve icy water. Very appreciated. Plus regular pools and hot tubs near your rooms.\n\nThe bad\nThey are trying to save money in every direction, which makes it all seem very thrifty in a luxury setting.\n- Lots of signs and Chatter about buying a timeshare\n- They closed the lobby sundry store before 7:00 pm!!! Both nights!! Posted times were open weekly until 9:30.\n- you are charged a $40.00 resort fee per suite that covers a bunch of stuff you don't need, but includes 2 good items: free wifi (although it's slow) and free water park admission. So it's a wash for me. I don't need the free valet - its a 10' walk, nor the USA today delivered, nor a one way shuttle to the mall.\n\nThe ugly\nI was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time. My plan had been to stop in after our dinner (we dined in their lobby restaurant) and pick up some breakfast items, plus some wine. Instead we paid $30 for a bottle of wine at the restaurant, and $50 for breakfast room delivery. And on that, it was late, and several items were missing. We had an early appointment, and couldn't use the lobby restaurant. Total bust.\n\nWhen I called the lobby reception to ask about it, they couldn't have cared less. They said \""well yeah, they leave if it's dead\"".\n\nThe cost of keeping an employee in there is $15.00 an hour. They would have sold 100.00 based on myself, and the 2 other couples that we're not sure why it was closed. Sadly, this just points to a very inexperienced manager in the economics area. Basically, 1 customer an hour will break it even.\n\nWould I stay here again? Yes. The Rooms are great. But it's just not a high end experience. We ate at 2 of the restaurants, and both were marginal at best.\n\nIf you have kids, stay here. But don't eat here (it's really overpriced for crappy food). And do use the coupons they give you!"
2,"We had a short mid-week stay with my two kids (10, 12). Overall the place is pretty great.  The kids loved the water park and I thought the staff and service were excellent.  The room was also very nice, but what is up with the 80's tv's.  Not a big deal until we settled in for the night to watch a movie.\n\nOn site restaurants were also good, we at the Lobby Restaurant and Aunt Chiladas (they shuttled us there in a golf cart, it was pretty fun)."
2,"Good value. It's an older property but decent place and price was right at 180/night during peak season. Great atmosphere on the patio to enjoy a drink or meal. Beds were actually pretty good for an older place, they are definitely newer. Convenient location right off the freeway and tucked into the side of the mountain. Didn't get out for golf but played there before and remember it being good bit great. It's not Scottsdale but it's a great value."
4,This place is beautiful. Hospitality is great. Food is good. Gym is good. Plenty to do here and plenty of swimming pools. Worth checking out.
4,Awesome resort and fabulous water park!  Great for the family!
2,"Great place to see a sparkling city-lights view at night.  Also a great place to experience some (slightly hokey) western atmosphere.  I love bringing out-of-towners to this place as they feel like they got a \""real southwesterny\"" experience.  Unfortunately, the food can be kinda hit-or-miss.  One night, all our entrees came out cold.  Another time, our steak was mostly fat, hardly any meat.  It is kinda pricey for what you get, but it's worth it if you want to show a visitor a good time.  The FRY BREAD makes it all worthwhile too.  Definitely call ahead for reservations on a weekend evening."
3,"I eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed my meal. This place grills a good steak, the bread that comes with you meal is really tasty and different. A must try is the rattlesnake..tastes like chicken.The atmosphere is fun and maybe a little overboard but in a good way. The magician here on the weekends is great so be sure to have him stop by your table his name is Flash."
2,"It's true, there is a real bull and a slide. This place has been around forever, I think my parents used to go there back in the 70's. \n\nI can't say much about the food since I've only been here for happy hour, which was pretty decent. Their HH  included top shelf for 3 bucks and some cheap beers. They also have appetizers on the HH menu, sliders, quesadillas and potato skins, that sort of stuff.\n\nPretty nice view and going during happy hour you can see all the people sitting in traffic on the 10 and cheers them from the balcony."
2,"Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  \n\nI'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere."
1,"Rustler's Rooste is a venerable Phoenix tradition.\n\nMany people have come here and had a great time.\n\nI last came here for an event with former students from my college, so my experience is probably atypical.\n\nOur event was part update on whats happening on campus, part memorial, and quite traditional.  We do it every year.  This was perhaps, the wrong venue for us.  We did not have the solemn atmosphere that the memorial part of the event demands, and the other groups around us were having so much fun that I could barely hear the speaker.\n\nNo wait staff were required for our group, so I can't tell what service might be like as a regular diner.  Our meal was a buffet style bbq chicken dinner, which I probably would avoid if I could. It was a bit overdone, to the point where it may have been better to skip the chick half and make do with the beans (bland), corn (waterlogged cobbettes), rolls (good for crumbs, but not much else), and the afterthought salad.\n\nIf I didn't know that much of my fee was going to scholarships, I'd think that I got ripped off."
0,"If you're looking for a cold beer and appetizers this is the place. Plenty of ambiance in this old west facsimile, but stop there.\nOk, maybe impress your  out of town friends with the rattlesnake, but dont go any further.\nOur meal was atrocious!\nThe \""family\"" style salad provided us each a generous single leaf of lettuce and an entire cherry tomatoe...no refills!\nThe bread basket boasted of Indian fry bread on the menu, this however looked more like a turd of some sort, and tasteless to boot, (sorry about the pun).\nWhen I ordered up my bone in ribeye, I asked for it Pittsburgh style, the server had never heard the term. (And she wasnt new in the job)\nI had visions of a thick cut (it did say 20 oz.) of well done prime rib steak. \nWhat I got was a tepid piece of meat that was at least 8 inches in diameter and only about 3/4 inch thick, full of fat and, due to it being served almost lukewarm, the fat was beginning to solidify.\nIn their defense, the green beans were tasty, but I had to wait for our party of 7 to finish eating before making my rounds, inquiring, \""Are you going to eat your beans?\""\nYes, I managed to make a meal out of the green beans, since that was the only good thing on the menu.\nWhen we left, I noticed 3 tour buses in the parking lot with what appeared to be out-of-towners lining up at the entrance. \nI can only deduce that this place is still in business because of its promise of old-west lore and the charm that goes with the scenery and view.\nI will never repeat this horrid experience.\nOh, I did give it one star due to our extremely pleasant young server who was all too anxious to please...but God help her, even she couldnt fix this mess!"
2,"Crazy, over-decorated, huge, kitchy, tourist-trap kind of experience. Should preface with the fact that we are vegetarian and were meeting a friend here who has wanted to check it out for a while. \n\nDrove up on a Saturday night at 7pm (apparently can't make reservations until after 8pm) and couldn't find any parking by the restaurant, weren't feeling in the mood for valet, so went down a decently sized hill to the extra parking lot. This resulted in us basically hiking to dinner, up a steep sidewalk with no stairs. Not sure how a family with any disabled or elderlies would handle this. Would have to pay for valet, I suppose. Walked to front door, hit with wall of \""cow smell\"", and sure enough there was a HUGE longhorn just chillin out about ten feet away. Walked in, more ramps to hike up, finally made it to level ground at the front desk area. All the hostesses were basically wearing American flags for shirts and the servers were decked out in cowboy gear. We had a hard time getting the attention of the hostess taking names which was a little frustrating. We were surprised to be seated immediately having no reservation on Saturday night, but I suppose this place is SO HUGE that it isn't much of a problem for smaller parties. It took a couple minutes to get through the labyrinth and find our table, on the way passing the oh-so-popular slide that you can take from floor 2 to floor 1. \n\nSat down and tried to start a conversation, and were immediately interrupted by the triangle-wielding server army that came to the table next to us to sing Happy Birthday. Lots of banging and clanging served for a poor conversation atmosphere, and this was only the first of several birthday celebrations throughout our meal! We ordered a pitcher of the Arizona margarita to split between two people, and it was pretty darn huge. However the margarita was quite disappointing - all sugar and no alcohol. We finished the whole pitcher and felt nothing except slightly ill at the sugar content.\n\nWe ordered the one veggie menu item, the veggie burger. Our friends got the prime rib. The meal started with a large basket of fry bread and biscuits with regular and cinnamon butter, pretty standard but yummy. Then the server brought a huge salad for the table to share, tossed with ranch dressing. That was a nice touch that we didn't realize was included. The meal came, and we were pretty shocked to see that it included green beans, corn on the cob, steak fries, veggie chili, AND the burger!! We couldn't finish one meal between two people, and we are good eaters. Everything was good, but nothing special. The green beans seemed fresh though the corn did not. The steak fries were yummy. The burger was good (housemade I believe) but nothing special. Our friend really liked his prime rib. It looked well-prepared and gigantic, just like everything else in the joint. The meal ended with the server bringing a tin can full of cotton candy. Man, they just don't want you to live past 40 around here!!!\n\nFor vegetarians who never go to places like this, I'd say we had close to the best experience we could have expected. It is a loud atmosphere and everything is pretty pricy - however, you are paying for a MASSIVE amount of food, so I suppose it works out. Our takeaways: Definitely split a meal, do NOT get the margaritas, and don't come here for a classy place and intimate conversation. You are coming for the experience (and the pretty spectacular view!). We won't be back, but can't say the same for our meat-eating friends!"
2,"Rustler's Rooste is that triangle of white lights (not the take me to your leader kind) you see on the hills in Ahwatukee at night. You park at the base of the hill or at the top if you are early enough and a van will take you to the top (if you are in heels you may want to wait for that van - although stilettos are best left at home duh). In a nutshell, the place is over the top rustic cowboy; every surface is covered in wood. The food is ok - the bread (biscuits, corn bread etc,) basket is the best part. \n\nYou wanna order the rattlesnake? Prepare to shell out $20 for it - let me save you the money. It's little scraps of chicken-like meat (the size of a nickle) deep fat fried and served with chipotle ranch. It literally tastes like dark meat chicken.\n\nThere's a live band (we were here on a weekend) playing the old classic country western (imagine that scene in Blues Brothers - Good Ole Boys style). No chicken wire cage though - bummer. \n\nAfter several drinks (which I recommend) go out on the patio and gaze at the city below. Then after more drinks, push the kids out of the way and take a ride down the slide - dare devils go head first. \n\nOverall - there is much to see even if the food is \""eeeh\"" - even the giant beast of a bull in a pen out front, great for tourists looking for a hokey night out, or if your family is in town, take them here and explain this is how AZ is - all covered in wood, stale booze, cowboys and old timey country music."
1,"Six of us dined for dinner after a recent Angels exhibition game.  The restaurant is on a hill with a beautiful view. We were greeted cordially and seated.  Our server was the best art of our experience. He was efficient with a good sense of humor. As first timers he explained the menu and asked f there were any questions. Bread and butter arrived quickly. Ou orders were promptly taken. So- so iceberg lettuce salad appeared shortly there after. \n\nThere was one order for Prime Rib medium rare and five orders for various steaks. The meal came with green beans and corn on the cob. There were two orders for baked potatoes.  \n\nThe food came in a timely manner. The Primr Rib came medium well, was dry with little or no flavor. All of the steaks were over cooked. All of the food was Luke warm at best. We came to the conclusion that ths is a VERY LARGE restaurant; and it is difficult to individualize orders. We are not likely to return to this restaurant. The view, the magician and server were the best parts of our dinner and not the food."
2,"It is highly recommended by my colleague down here.  The atmosphere is great, cowboy themed restaurant and this is a great band playing.  We are seating by the windows and you can see a great view of Phoenix.  I ordered a T-bone steak but I have to say the the steak is good except it is not hot enough.  It will be much better if they can heat up the plate a little bit before they served the steak."
0,"Wow, this dull theme park of a restaurant is horrible. Kids would love it, but the prices are way too high for a family. They have a big longhorn steer in a corral near the front door, so the entrance smells like cow pies. Not appetizing! \n\nWe were seated right by a door that kids were shrieking in and out of, and the hostess refused our request to move to a nearby clean, empty table. The waiter was fine, but the food was completely disappointing -- nothing was seasoned. The salad and fry bread were OK, but the sauteed shrimp had not seen any salt, pepper, herbs, anything. They tasted boiled actually. it came with rice mixed with mushrooms, celery and green beans, no salt or flavor in that either. My colleague's bone-in rib-eye, ordered medium-rare, was chewy and bland. I guess we should have been on alert when the waiter placed the bottle of steak sauce on the table first. Why wouldn't they at least salt a nice steak? \n\nPrices for their tasteless entrees were high, from $25 to $35. This place is awful. Even if you go expecting Western fun and music, you should at least get a great meal for the price. Not here."
4,"Fun atmosphere, great drinks and tasty food. My wife and I had a great dinner here we will be back when were back in Phoenix :)"
0,"First off I would like to say that our experience was like night and day compared to the last time we were here. It's funny that I went back and read my last review and I was surprised to see that I had ordered a filet again. I guess I must be a creature of habit. My tastes have not changed, but the service and quality of RR sure has.\nLet me start off saying that I made reservations weeks in advance. I reserved a booth like last time, and wanted this to be a special Saturday Night Mother's Day Dinner! Things just did not pan out that way. As we drove up there were no more handicap parking spots available. I asked the valet if there were anymore, and he said, \""This is a busy place at 6pm and obviously there are a lot of retired individuals here\"". Well I'm not retired, but my Mother was planning on having us park in a handicap space. No biggie handed the keys to the valet. We were sat right away at a small table downstairs at the far East end. We had a nice view of the city, as well as being right next to the wait station. The evening went downhill from here.\nWe ordered a shrimp cocktail, and some deep fired mushrooms & zucchini. They were very good, came out hot and the shrimp were large and tasty. We ordered Iced Teas & water and our server had a tough time refilling them throughout the night. Even when we would ask for refills ahead of time we had to wait. The salad was terrible! The lettuce was wilted with too much dressing. It tasted like it had been premade and holding somewhere waiting for the busy dinner push. My wife had a nice burger with onion rings and it was the best meal by far. Everything was hot and there was a lot of food. But one would expect that with a $14 burger. My Mother-In-Law had the ribs and she said they were done well and very tender. My Mother & I ordered the filet and I must say that it was plain, tasteless, and not worth it at all. It looked like it had been cooked and held in au jus or a steam well, and possibly microwaved to a hot temperature. I ordered mine medium and it was gray all the way through. I took one bite and was done. My server never asked how my steak was, or why I had not touched it or my beans and corn. When we were getting our plates cleared I asked if my meal could be taken off the bill and that I was not interested in anything else. He returned and said that the manager took my meal off our bill. My Mother on the other hand ate more than a few bites and hers was not taken off the bill. We did not order dessert and when outside to watch the sunset. I had made our reservations for 6pm so we could be outside by 7:19pm for the sunset. The views were awesome as always. It was unfortunate that there was a private party taking up over 75% of the patio, including the prime locations on the Westside where I enjoyed the fire-pits on our last visit. \nI do have to commend Tom Mills for getting back in touch with me. As I mentioned I've been a GM for some time, and I don't believe that 20% off was enough to entice me to go back. This is place that you take out of town guests to experience something special in Phoenix. I live in Ahwatukee and love to try and support local businesses'. Rustler's Rooste did ask to follow me on Instagram and inquired if they could post a picture of my Mother and I on the patio with the wonderful view in the background. This is my reply to Tom, I never heard back from him.\n\nTom,\nFirst off I would like to thank you for getting back to me. I did follow Rustler's Rooste on Twitter for a bit, I even tweeted about how excited I was to take my family there. But all and all it was not a good experience. \nI pretty sure that Brain asked my dinner companions how their food was, not sure if he addressed me, pretty sure he did not. Obviously it doesn't take a mental giant to figure out that I did not touch my plate. \nThe overall experience was lackluster at best. The food to me resembled something like a public school cafeteria meal. Like I had mentioned the salad was awful, and the green beans had been holding somewhere for a long time. \nI appreciate you extending an email to me. I am well aware of guest first service; every guest is my guest, want for nothing service, secret shoppers, and whatever Rustler's Rooste 10 Commandments are for steps of service. I have been a local restaurant general manager for years. You are welcome to look me up on LinkedIn. \nThanks again for reaching out to me. I can honestly say that I don't think that I will take you up on your offer. I appreciate it and will save your email. Like I have previously mentioned I have been going to Rustler's Rooste since I was a bartender at Bobby McGee's in the late '80s. It used to be some place special to take out of town visitors, kind of a land mark if you will. I just think that time and expectations have changed."
1,"Perks: fun atmosphere and great views. Cute slide from second floor that kids and adults alike were smiling as they went down. Probably one of the best views of the Valley and big outdoor patio that is great for photos.\n\nCons: the food. Ugh. My burger was overcooked and the bun was hard. The fries were barely warm. My husband wanted a steak for his birthday which he described \""was okay once he reached the middle.\"" Vegetarian friend was served Mac and cheese with meat in it but server was very apologetic. Other friend said her beef ribs were pretty good, but, all in all, very overpriced for the quality of food. All that saves this place is the ambiance which, for some people, is enough. \n\nI personally, wouldn't return."
1,View was incredible. Service was quick and nice. Fried bread was delicious.  Steaks were mediocre.  Vegetables and sides were awful.
0,"Worst service EVER for large parties. We had a party of 12 in celebration of my father in law's 50th birthday. We ordered our food and it took over a hour and a half for it to come out!!! I'm sorry but that's just terrible. Every time we asked the waiter about our food he said \""Oh, it will be out in a few minutes\"". We watched every table around us eat their food and leave before we even got our food. These parties were anywhere from 6-10 people so I don't understand why it took so long for 12 people. \n\nThe food itself was nothing impressive either. The best part about the dinner was probably the Indian fry bread. Everything else was edible.\n\nWe will definitely never be eating here again."
2,A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.  \n\nI would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.\n\nWhen you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!\n\nEnjoy the views from this hilltop location!
2,"I went to RR with my 5 year old on a daddy daughter date night on Saturday.  She chose RR because she saw that they had the slide.  I called to see if they would accept a reservation and the only opening they had was at 8:30PM or show up with a 45 minute wait.  I decided to go ahead and show up and wait and hoping it wouldn't be that long.  When we drove up, I thought it was going to be a very long wait as the main parking lot was full and we had to drive to the additional parking.  When we walked up to the hostess desk a little after 7PM, they said it would be a 30 minute wait.  We decided to check out the place and my daughter wanted to do the slide.  She pretty much just went up and down on the slide until our buzzer rang, which was less than 30 minutes.  We got a table right by the windows, so it was a nice view.  It seemed like a bit before someone came with water and even longer before we saw our waitress.   \n\nI ordered the bbq chicken and my daughter ordered the spaghetti.  As we waited, they provided a nice hot basket of fried bread and biscuits.  The fried bread was good with honey, but not the usual fry bread I'm accustomed to since it was doughier.  My daughter liked the fry bread (because of the honey), the biscuit not so much.  One of the two balloon artists came by and she got a flower as we waited.\n\nOur dinner didn't seem to take too long to make despite it being very busy.  They first brought out the salad, which had a ranch dressing.  Soon afterwards, our dinners came.  The kid's spaghetti came with two garlic bread pieces and a lot of spaghetti.  My bbq chicken came with steamed veggies, corn, and beans.  As far as the food, my daughter said that we make better spaghetti at home.  My chicken was dry and the bbq sauce was ok.  On the bright said, my daughter really liked the corn.  The veggies had way too much pepper.  The beans had some spice to them, but were just okay.  We had plenty of leftovers to take home.  The best part of dinner was yet to come though.  When they brought out the cotton candy, my daughter gobbled it up.  I had a few bites and I must say, the cotton candy tasted very fresh and probably was the best cotton candy I've had.  It had a very nice bubble gum favor.  My daughter probably could have gobbled up another one.\n\nWhen we got the bill, I was pleasantly surprised.  RR must have a special where you buy an adult entr\u00e9e and you get a kids meal free.  Not sure if that is an offer they have all the time or just certain days.\n\nDid I mention this is a very family friendly place?  There were a lot of families and kids at RR on Saturday.  The line at times for the slide was long.  My daughter enjoyed going on the slide so much before dinner that I let her go on the slide again after dinner.  She did this for about 20 minutes and before I told her it was time to go.  She probably could have slid on it for another 30 minutes if I let her.\n\nOverall, I would give the RR two stars for the food and one additional star for the ambience.  The most memorable part of the evening for my daughter was the slide and the cotton candy, which I would agree."
3,"One of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday. It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. \n\nMy twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \""good old days\"" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.\n\nRustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  \n\nBut!  You also get a cowboy hat.\n\nI have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).\n\nAs for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.\n\nFor the meal, I had the \""catch of the day\"" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  \n\nBut this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? \n\nProbably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns."
0,"This place was great - many years ago.  Sadly, it's a shadow of its former self. Sure, the place still has terrific views but that's it.  The tables and chairs are rickety and aren't cleaned often, as using my hand to pull my own chair in found at least two used pieces of gum affixed to the underside.  \n\nMy wife and I quickly ordered macaroni and cheese for our two year old son while we looked over our menu options.  The mac and cheese arrived within two minutes - clearly it's made en masse - but was overcooked and lacked any discernible flavor.  This should have been all the warning we needed, but instead we forged ahead and ordered the \""Cowboy Stuff\"" platter for two.  At $21.95 per person it seemed like a good value for all it promised; BBQ chicken and ribs, skewers of beef, chicken, and seafood, baked potatoes, corn, the works.  What was delivered was a baking sheet with all the aforementioned food loaded onto it, but with whole carrots with the green stems still on, celery stalks with leaves on it, and so on.  It looked like someone had been foraging in the woods for our dinner.   It was accompanied by a very forgettable salad that had tons of dressing, yet lacked flavor of any kind.  \n\nThen came the taste test of our main course.  The name of this restaurant really should be \""Overcooked and Flavorless\"" because the trend started with our son's unfortunate kid's meal was consistent across the entire meal.  \n\nMy son needed to use the restroom, so we headed off in that direction.  The baby changing station isn't even in the bathroom, but affixed to a wall out in the hall for all to see.  Walking into the bathroom, we took one look at the dirty, dank surroundings and immediately headed the other direction.  We'll wait, thanks.  \n\nGetting back to the table and trying my food, I decided to ask for the manager to voice my concerns.  Unbeknownst to me, my wife had already spoken with him.  When he arrived, he seemed exasperated and told me, \""I already told her I'd replace the meal with something else and she said no.  What else do you want?\""   Um, well NOTHING now, pal.  So sorry to be an interruption to your evening of overcooking and underseasoning everything.  \n\nWe won't be back again.  Ever."
1,"First, let's start with a few positives....\nGreat view!!! Yesterday, I was very disappointed in Rustlers Rooste! We made reservations for 5 pm, arrived at 4:45 and did not get seated until 6:20 pm. Many families were in same boat! It was a chaotic scene yesterday! Service was horrible, mashed potatoes were WAY too salty and pumpkin pie was super soggy / sugary! The only thing they got right was the turkey and yummy salad. For next thanksgiving, please honor your reservations! People don't mind waiting 15 to 30 minutes... But really an hour and a half??? You got the view going for you but that is about it! A total disappointment Rustlers Rooste... Why?"
0,"More interested in money than your teeth,. Always pushing unneeded cosmetic procedures ( I'm 50, i dont need braces!).  Horrible customer service.  Billing practices are irregular, confusing  and they are unable to explain why we paid so much more than the estimate. They never returned any of my calls for explanation.  we are getting a new dentist!"
1,"Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better."
2,"It's Hooters guys... shouldn't expect too much here.\n\nI will say they are somewhat expensive but recently they had all you can eat wings and another special of boneless wing basket on Wed nights and a few friends and me went there every week for that deal with a couple pitchers... but the beer is even pricey.\n\nI do love their boneless wings and their buffalo chicken sandwiches, pickle and tater salad are a good combo.  I don't go super hot but they have a good range of heat and some honey hots and other good stuff - I say mix it up a bit and try em all out.\n\nThe scene is the same though I will say this location has some talent as of late.  You also have the sports know-it-all who got cut his freshman year and never let it go, the affliction wearing douchebag that's never rolled on a mat in his life, and the fat sloppy guy that takes all the pictures with the girls.   Don't get me wrong, there are others in there but just typical those dudes are in there. \n\nThe girls are super nice... obviously.  But they're not gonna date you big guy - just sayin\n\nAlso, as far as I know they do provide the UFC fights for free so it's an okay backup if you don't have anywhere else to watch it.\n\nI don't eat there a lot but it's not bad when I do :)"
1,"Started coming here every now and then because it's close to where I work so if I don't have time at my home gym I'll make it up here.  I try to avoid that happening though because I dislike this gym that much.  The staff is average as they are at most LA Fitness locations, some are very friendly but the majority just seem bored.  The layout of the equipment seems strange, related body parts aren't really grouped together and the equipment itself is older and not very up to date.  This next thing I know isn't the gym's fault but it's something I've noticed at this location especially and it's male gym-goers ogling a bit too much.  It's really annoying when you're running on a treadmill and a couple guys just stops and stares at you very obviously.  So like I said, I come here if I have no choice but I try to keep it from happening when possible."
3,First time to Waffle House and we were not disappointed. Selection is basic but service was friendly and the hot and delicious was served in under 5 minutes. We were headed out of town and this place was perfect for a hot meal on the go.
1,"I really really wanted to like this place because it's relatively close to our house. The prawns on our salad were not cooked all the way, and the Tom Yum Gong soup was bland. Not sure how you can make that soup bland, but they did it. The under-cooked food was enough to cure me for life - I won't go back."
0,"Heard good things, but, did not even measure up. Very bland...really man? It's Thai how can it be flavorless? Don't waste your time!"
2,If you like Thai food it is pretty good. But I guess I was spoiled while visiting Thailand that it's oilier food than I experienced with original Thai food. It's ok but I'm still looking for a more legit Thai food place. There's always a mom n pop shop somewhere especially when there's another Thai Basil 2-3 miles down the road.
0,"I'm really surprised at all the good reviews of this place. We have been trying to find a good Indian place in the area and chose here because of the good reviews. The bottom line is that all of the food was extremely bland. We got the vegetable samosa,  shrimp vindaloo, Bangan Bhartha, and garlic naan. The vegetable samosa's crust was very hard and didn't flake off like I'm used to, the filling was average (this was the best tasting thing we got). The shrimp vindaloo was in a very watery bland sauce that reminded me of italian tomato sauce. The Bangan Bhartha was just unbelievably bland. The atmosphere of the place was not bad and the service was pretty good. I didn't even want to keep eating after the first couple of bites."
3,This place is the spot for lunch! I mean come on. Its Indian food buffet style! What's not to like about that. They serve you garlic naan or plain naan also buffet (all you can eat). The have all the standard fare as well as basmati rice. I always eat about a metric ton of food and when I get the bill... That's right $10. Starbucks costs more than that!! Definitely try this place out.
3,"I really like star of India. I usually get their chicken tikka masala. I also enjoy their vegetable korma. What stands out for me is their special naan.  Naan bread stuffed with maraschino cherries, coconut, and nuts. I've yet to find it at any other Indian restaurant. \n\nI agree with another reviewer that the place needs a decorating update. It kind of looks a little shabby. Doesn't bother me much, I just really like the food. When I was going there on a regular basis the owners seemed to know who I was and, they were very friendly. \nI have been going to Star of India for the past three years on my birthday.  Always a good birthday treat."
3,"Big sandwiches.  Big.\n\nBread is great on a good day and fair when they don't have it fresh.\n\nMom loves the Philly cheese-steak.\n\nI like the Italian.  I always ask for hot peppers.\n\nOrdering and paying can be a bit confusing.  Best thing to do is to order and immediately go to the cash register to pay.  Otherwise you have your sandwich, you're hungry and then you have to go pay.  I'm not sure how they don\""t get ripped off.  It would seem to me it would be easy to order, wait, take and leave. \n\nThe chips they offer, name escaping me now, are very good.  I know that at most sandwich places I do not get chips but here I do.  BBQ is my favorite here."
0,"So dissapointing! I ordered the club that claims to be \""piled high\"" with turkey ham lettuce mayo and cranberry sauce... Triple decker style.  I opened my sandwich and thought I had been given the wrong one. It was as tall as a sandwich with only 2 pieces of bread which was the first bad sign considering there was a 3rd piece of bread in there. The turkey was ok but the ham was minuscule and looked like Walmart pressed ham... Yuck! And the lettuce; one little sliver of iceberg. Waste of money!"
2,I have eaten here two times now the first time it was pretty dead in the place and there was what looked like a group of kid's part of the family... My server seemed to cater to that group over me I am a paying customer keep that in mind... I ordered the General Tso's Chicken (Crunchy fried white meat tossed with scallions in a spicy sauce. I was a good meal nothing above and beyond... The second trip was for a lunch and I ordered the Mongolian beef (Spicy marinated beef saut\u00e9ed with scallions and sweet yellow onions served over a bed of crispy rice noodles and sprinkled with sesame seeds... This was a really good meal and great service so let's hope the third this as good.
4,"We went to Mr Chao's Friday night to get away from the Wild Horse Pass Resort for a while.  The food is fantastic!  We loved it so much that we went back on Saturday after a full day of golf.  We were told the owner cooks all of the food, try the dumplings.  This is a hidden jewel...."
0,This practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off.  From now on I am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mail
0,"Do research on karate and compare schools. This school puts emphasis on katas and teaches very little sparring. Ranks are questionable at best. If you want to do nice katas and you do not care about learning real karate or practical self defense this school may work for you. This school is also not at many locals tournaments, red flag. Took my child out and put them in another school. He's now having to relearn everything and realizing they could have gotten really hurt becouse they thought they were learning self defense. It's dangerous. But, if you want to exercise and learn Kata dancing and point sparring this could be a good fit, otherwise please do your homework.Teenagers are doing most the teaching. Or adults with new black belts."
0,"Called for an appointment and to make sure that they received my vision insurance plan as the plan website recommend this place. \nA totally rude lady picks the phone and after I ask about the plan and is obvious that my question is making her life difficult,  she puts me on hold for about 3 minutes comes back tell me that they don't take the insurance. When I explained that their website recommends them puts me on hold again for 5 minutes and again picks the phone ask me if I want to make an appointing without an insurance completely rude and without any concern of customer care. I told her that I was just going to check with my plan  and she hung up the phone on me. There are so many other stores like this in the area but was the closes home but in definitely going somewhere else."
2,"Hey it's Taco Bell - what do you want?  I'm giving this three stars because it's A-Ok which is Yelp's rating system.\n\nIf you haven't been to a Taco Bell before then I don't know what to tell you - it's cheap imitation Mexican food with questionable quality ingredients.  It's not like you're going to take the pope here for a visit though, you're just getting some food.\n\nThe staff at this location are helpful and pleasant, and that's really all I ask for.  I don't come here often, but it's true to the Taco Bell brand."
3,"I'm torn between shouting from the rooftops about how much I love Arrivederci's happy hour and keeping it as my own little secret so it doesn't become overcrowded.  Well . . . here it goes, fingers crossed!\n\nWe had been here for dinner a few times and were very pleased, we decided we needed to try their happy hour.  I'm so glad we did; this is one of my new favorite quiet happy hour spots.  Not quite as trendy as Va Bene, but that's a good thing.  Less of a singles scene, less noisy and the food is just as delicious!  Happy hour is M-F 5-7.\n\nWe walked in a few minutes after 5 and were greeted by a very friendly bartender.  He kindly brought us menus and explained that during happy hour all wines by the glass are $5.  Wonderful!! He brought us some water (with a slice of cucumber, nice touch), took our drink orders, and gave us a few minutes to decide on food.\n\nIn addition to the wine specials, there are happy hour food specials! Half off bruschetta, pizza, and other appetizers.  We went with the Calamari In Umido (large tube calamari saut\u00e9ed in white wine & clam broth with a touch of tomato) and the Margherita pizza. They make their own mozzarella here, people!!\n\nBefore we received the appetizers, the bartender gave us some fresh bread with oil and balsamic to snack on.  The calamari came out first and it was fabulous, as was using the free bread to sop up the amazing broth!  Then came the pizza and while it didn't blow me away, it was still very good and that mozzarella is so creamy and fresh!  \n\nAs embarrassed as I am to admit it, we got three rounds of that yummy bread to use for that delicious broth of the calamari.  The best part, the bartender didn't seem to mind a bit that we were being a little greedy with the free bread!  What a nice guy!  Did I mention the bread and broth were delicious?\n\nThe bar area is nice with a small-ish size bar and a few high-top tables.  My favorite part was the living room set up past the bar.  Some comfy couches and a projection screen.  I can't wait to plan a friendly group happy hour so we can lounge around on the couches drinking wine and snacking on appetizers.\n\nThe service was great, the food was great, the price was right, and the atmosphere is cool and cozy.  What more can a girl ask for?  A couple more times like this, and this is a five star rating . . . easy!"
0,"I am really quite surprised at the high reviews for this establishment. They truly don't deserve it! I purchased a coupon for this restaurant through my work (after checking the Yelp reviews, of course) so we were excited to give them a try but were sorely let down.\n\nWhen we arrived the first thing I noticed was the place was empty at 6pm. Well that's not a good sign! We waited for one of the employees to acknowledge us between their laughter and chatter between each other. Once being taken to our table we looked at the menu and couldn't believe the prices; they were extremely high. I told my boyfriend, its a good thing we have a coupon, this better be some dang good Italian food! Due to the high prices, we decided to share an appetizer and an entree, surely it would be plenty, it's an Italian restaurant! \n\nIt took about 25 minutes for our appetizer of meatballs to arrive and when it did my boyfriend and I just looked at each other. There were about 6 tiny meatballs swimming in some marinara. I was expecting huge meatballs like what you get at Oregano's...nope, not even close! So we ate, and unfortunately the dish was nothing special. They tasted like they were from a frozen bag. As we were waiting for our entree I had been needing more water but regardless of the empty restaurant no one was checking on us. We waited for our entree another 20 minutes after that. Why was it taking so long? We were the only ones in the dining room. We finally received our entree. What the hell! It was just about the same size as our appetizer!!! There were three small rolls of pasta. Seriously? Did someone eat the other 3/4 of it back in the kitchen? We ate those in about literally a minute and then tried to scarf down some bread to help fill our stomachs. And the worst part, it wasn't that good. At this point I finally was given more water. \n\nNeedless to say we would never come back here. Why pay such ridiculous prices for tiny portions of pretentious food with a side of crappy service? No thanks, I'll head over to Oregano's or RigaTonys!"
0,"Food - 5.0\nService - 7.0\nManagement - 0.0\n\nA big disappointment.\n\nI brought my wife and kids here knowing I had a Groupon for $40. It's Mother's Day. We hadn't eaten here before, so a Groupon is a great incentive to try something new. When we arrived it was less than half full at around 6pm. Atmosphere was ordinary, but it appeared that they were professional. Cloth napkins and table clothes and well dressed staff. We ordered our food, which included wine, and rang up at tab just over $100. The food was nothing to write home to mom about, but it wasn't terrible. The quality didn't match the prices, however we knew we had our Groupon, so it made it all palatable. That is until we tried to pay and explained we had a Groupon, but I let him know I would still be tipping on the pre-Groupon total. He frowned and said that they don't take Groupon's on holidays. Having used many Groupons prior at other places, I always check the Fine Print before going. The only restriction it showed was that it couldn't be used during happy hour or in conjunction with other coupons. I showed the waiter this and he still gave me the heisman pose. I asked to speak to the manager, thinking this must be a mistake, and to my great surprise, the manager held his ground stating this was Groupon's policy in the Fine Print. I showed him that it said nothing about \""holidays,\"" and he too stood his ground. I decided to take the high ground and save myself and my family further embarrassment and paid the tab (still tipped the waiter well since it wasn't his fault, per se), and here I write. Long story short, what a hustle and great disappointment. Not a great way to get a return customer who racks up $100 tabs for pasta. I've never seen a manager who would choose not only a battle that was wrong, but knowing that we would never return. \n\nI do not suggest supporting this establishment. This is my first YELP writeup."
1,"I usually have excellent service at this location, so maybe this was an off day.  I dropped my car off and asked how long for a tire rotation.  They said 45-60mins max.  After 60 mins of waiting, my car still hadn't been moved or worked on.  I couldn't wait any longer, especially since service hadn't begun yet, so I asked for my keys.  The manager was very apologetic and sincere and asked me to wait a little longer, but I had an appointment to get to...so off I went  Service could have been better if they kept me informed of the delay, I'm pretty understandable, but there was no communication.  I will still try them again."
4,"So this one tops King's Buffet for us! A tiny bit pricier because the $8.99 doesn't include drinks like King's does but TOTALLY worth it! And yes, their teriyaki chicken is better than King's too!!\n\nWe (my husband, daughter, and I) met up with Rand H. and Mike C. for lunch today and it was a great choice! So much variety and everything was fresh and steaming. Service was awesome and the right amount of helpful, not in your face but there when you needed it. \n\nMy only complaint was the fried rice, they only had shrimp fried rice out today and I'm allergic to shrimp so I had to pass. My husband loved everything he tried except the sweet and sour chicken, it tasted a tad bit bland to him but I thought it was fine. Not spectacular like everything else but still great. My daughter ate everything we offered her (not typical lately!) and was delighted with the beautiful fresh plump grapes they had available. I believe she also stole my husband's chinese donut and loved it too. \n\nBy the way, this 5-star rating may just be the first one I've handed out to date so congrats to you Hong Kong Gourmet! And thank you for the awesome food!!!"
0,"Summary: every dish, and I mean every dish tasted like it was under a heat lamp for 6 hours. I expected much more. They had a great selection of sushi, classic Chinese dishes, stir fry counter, and extensive seafood bar. It is a shame that all were so bland. I will not be back."
0,"The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly."
2,"I used to love going to this Starbucks! Unfortunately, I do not feel the same way after their recent remodel. I figured they would expand to the small vacant room next door or even add more chairs (since it's always so busy here). It looks like they went to ikea and bought the cheapest furniture they could find and limiting any seating space. \n\nThis is a pretty busy Starbucks compared to many others I've been to. It's just disappointing."
0,"BAD!!!\n\nI have had great Italian fare from NY to New Jersey. Also being Italian growing up with homemade Italian food from sauce, to pizza to canolis. From a Italian who knows the food this place is no good, it's not homemade it tastes worse than Olive Garden, and I hate OG and their fake Italian crap.. The noodles are obliviously not homemade. the sauce bland.you throw down nearly 30 bucks for crappy commercialized Italian? I think the only thing I enjoyed half way was the salad, but who can mess up a salad? \nI seen plenty of the older crowd here, I think this is the only thing that keeps this place going.\n\nBell' Italia - You get two thumbs down from me - I'm not coming back"
0,"Saw Dr. Hetrick..I went to this office for Chronic headaches and neck pains. I felt like they did not care about my health condition and now I have Migraines. I told them I take medication that helps me a bit to get through the day but gets worse to the point where i'm out of it.What's their fix, a bag full of more medications (watch out liver) feels like they thought I was faking or something. Worst place to go really unhappy that I wasted my money and time"
3,"Who doesn't like a country style breakfast? I'm such a fan of Cracker Barrel and I forget that I work right up the street from it (probably a good thing). My buddy and I were craving breakfast for lunch once again. I think we're on some unspoken quest for the perfect breakfast for lunch place. \n\nI am so glad we headed to Cracker Barrel today. I had \""Mama's french toast breakfast\"". It should be called \""Mama's stuff you full because she knows damn well you ain't been eatin' right without her there platter\"". It came with 4 slices of sourdough french toast, 2 eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and of course I had to order a small side of the hash brown casserole. Of course. I washed all the artery clogging goodness with a large OJ. YUM. Everything came out hot and fresh and with maple syrup. Real maple syrup, y'all! My lunch buddy had the country breakfast that came with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, and grits! We were both so happy we were giggling like little kids in between bites of the great breakfast. For about the same price of another competitor's breakfast platter, we got a fresh baked, hot off the griddle and huge breakfast. I think we've decided that this is a favorite from now on! \n....or have we???"
2,Excellent food as always
2,"It was an average restaurant. Mill gravy is to sweet and as other reviewer stated needs more pepper and really could use chunks of sausage. The smoked sausage was very good, would love the gravy with it in it. For breakfast the price is right. Service was great I'd give our girl a 5 star as she was prompt and nice, took good care of her customers. Our food was delivered very very fast I was shocked."
3,This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality.
3,"If you don't like a wait don't come here on Saturday or Sunday morning because it's inevitable. Other than that any other time you can pretty much walk right in without a wait. The food is average American Comfort with the huge Southern Hospitality portions us fat Americans have grown to love and expect. The service is usually A+ ( on average I usually tip the servers 25% because they are so nice and welcoming). I prefer the Breakfast menu over the Lunch & Dinner selection. My favorite breakfast is the Blueberry pancakes that's served with REAL blueberry syrup, I usually get bacon and scrambled eggs on the side. For dinner you can't go wrong with the Catfish or Chicken Fried steak. The price or the food and quantity/quality are right on. Don't expect fine dining here but do enjoy the fat induced food coma afterwards."
3,I've gone there several times just for breakfast and have never been disappointed. I love the service. They are very friendly and thoughtful. I love the hash browns  and the grits. Seems like a old fashion combo. The food is always warm to hot when I get it. The coffee is always full and I don't have to hunt down the wait staff to get my coffee filled. My mom came down from Montana and she loved the wall decorations (she could relate) and the over all experience.
3,"This is a great library. It's in a good location, the WIFI is free and there's a good selection of items. They recently started stocking television shows, which is awesome! They have both old and new shows on DVD and the best part is, they're free! I really love the hold system. If there's something I want at another library, I can just place a hold and within a few days, it's shipped to me and I can pick it up. \n\nThe staff is pretty great at this location. Everyone i've encountered has been helpful and nice. All the librarians who do storytime are great! The shelvers manage to keep the shelves in decent order and the check out desk is quick with my holds!"
3,"Try not to view Ironwood as an extension of the huge Burton Barr library and look at it for what it really is--a small community library. It is a great resource for Ahwatukee. It's clean, has free wifi and plenty of popular items, and is a great place to get out of the heat during the summer for any number of people.\n\nSince they're part of the Phoenix library system, they have access to great services like the Overdrive catalog. Go online and log in with your library card to check out audiobooks and ebooks! You can check out 10 at a time. There are also plenty of great community programs like the Culture Passes mentioned in another review.\n\nThe one downside is that the staff is pretty unhelpful (and sometimes unfriendly). I've had my daughter ask for a book because it was listed as being on the shelf but it wasn't in its place. I don't need a staff member to walk over to the shelf, look at the empty spot, and then shrug, saying it must be lost. I could discern that myself. Some of the ladies working behind the counter (I don't know what their function is) are downright unfriendly and sullen. Retire and let some newer blood in, if you hate your job that much.\n\nIgnore the staff and you'll be golden."
2,"Been here a couple of times now - like that you can really customize your burger and the fries or onion rings that go with it.  Also enjoy sitting outside by the fountain or fireplace and that I can take the dog !  But it is a little bit pricey for a burger, so usually only go when I have have a groupon/deal chicken - but it is a good pit stop before a movie.  Don't ask too many questions though as english is a struggle for the cook especially."
2,"*I can buy 3 get 2 free!!!!!* I happen to like getting shower gel from Bath and Body Works but the people that work here can be a little obnoxious. And wait, did I say you can buy 3 get 2 free? Are they commissioned? Honestly, when I tell someone I'd just like to browse, I really mean, I'd just like to browse. Perhaps, smell a few fragrances. I don't really need a play by play of every fragrance in the store. \""Oooh, that one is fresh!\"" \""How do you like that one... very clean!\""  \""Oh yessss, sultry!!\"" \""If you buy 3, you can get 2 free!\"" You realize I can buy 3 shower gels and get 2 free? I mean that is 5 freakin shower gels, how many do I need? The employees are friendly enough but maybe they should back off a little unless the customer explicitly asks for help. P.S. I was at the check out, paying for my soap, honestly just wanting ONE. For old time sake, I was once again asked if I was *sure* I only wanted one. Hey, did you know it's buy 3 get 2 free?"
2,"We like to come in here to shop for clothes and luggage.  You can find some great deals in here.  The selection of luggage is pretty good too.  I've found some great carry on bags.\n\nIt can get really busy here, especially on weekends.  The best time to shop is mid-week in the middle of the day.  The employees here are usually friendly and the store is kept clean.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%"
2,"So yesterday I went to the movies with my mom and my sister in law  and after we decided to come here to have linner because my mom had some gift cards. I have been here before and it has always been pretty good, I usually get a half caesar salad and a cup of tortilla soup but have also tried the spring rolls, the caeser sandwich, pastas, and some pizzas. It has all been pretty good. But anyway, back to yesterday... First off, when you come here you have to request bread and the bread they give you is just kind of plain mediocre bread, nothing exciting. Then it is time to order and I decided to try something different and ordered the chicken tequila fettuccini. My mom got the fusilli pasta with veggies (her usual) and the sis got a shrimp salad of sorts. Everything was good, but, in my opinion, it was overpriced. My dish had a lot of flavor and I enjoyed it, but it cost around 13$. I would have no problem with this price at an independent restaurant, but I think this is too much for a chain. Everyone else seemed to like their food too. Also, the service was decent, our waitress was timely and friendly. So this is a good chain to go to when you just saw a movie or are shopping at dessert ridge, but it is still a chain and isn't anything mind blowing."
2,"When half a restaurant's menu is available in the freezer section of the grocery store in the same shopping center (and tastes exactly the same), one probably should go for the cheaper option. CPK isn't bad, it's just not worth it exorbitant price. And God forbid you want something extra. There's an up charge for everything. $2.75 for a couple chunks of avocado in my salad.  I know a restaurant has overhead costs, but how about I grab a whole one from said grocery store for less?\n\nAs for the pizza; the quality is just okay and thanks to the millions of imitators that have improved on the concept of nontraditional toppings, the chain is not as unique as it seemed 20 years ago. Every place in the US now has a signature BBQ Chicken Pizza.\n\nSo why does CPK get three stars? I'll give the chain credit for its easy online ordering, curbside pickup, and friendly staff. But, you can certainly find better within a couple miles of Desert Ridge."
1,"CPK is one of my favorite restaurants and this location was by far the worst one I visited. First of all, the waitress never offered me any bread. No biggie. I ordered a soup, starter salad, and a pasta. The baked potato soup was so thick, it actually tasted pretty bad; the starter salad was a disappointment because the greens were kind of dried out, and the pasta (chicken tequila) sauce was watery. Overall, it was a pretty bad meal."
1,"I originally gave the following five star review and had to REVISE...\""I was staying at the JW Marriott across the street and in desperate need of a manicure.  Not wanting to pay a million dollars at the hotel, I saw the place and walked in.  It was extremely crowded, which is annoying, but a good sign.  I got the gel manicure and the spa pedi.  It was absolutely amazing and the service was to die for.  The massage for my feet was extra long... Wonderful. The hand massage extended to my shoulders and was amazing.  If I lived here, I would be back every  other week and a regular.  Wow... I am happy!  Yay!!!\""\n\nMy gel manicure started chipping AFTER ONE DAY.  Boo.  This is NOT supposed to happen.  Other reviewers had the same response and I couldn't believe it because I had a good experience.  if you go here get a REGULAR manicure NOT GEL.  It was a huge disappointment the next day and I didn't have time to go back.  Spent the rest of my trip with ugly chipped nails."
3,I read the bad reviews about the tailor but I have been there about 4 times and everything has looked good every time. I think the last 3 times I have just pinned the stuff myself so not sure about how anything he needs to pin works out. I just go because it's convenient but I just did pay $20 to have a dress hemmed. Not sure what they would charge elsewhere but I haven't had any problems so far so I keep going.
2,"On our way to the movie theater, we decided to grab a quick breakfast. Fortunately, it was late enough (9:50am) that there wasn't a line. Since I normally do not eat breakfast at Paradise Bakery, I had to hang back and take in the menu. Luckily, the employees were really nice and waited while I decided. After ordering, our food came quickly. I ordered the Asiago breakfast sandwich - bacon, egg, and Vermont white cheddar on a bagel. I subbed for a plan bagel with no hassle. It was relatively inexpensive and filling. I'd order it again if I was ever in the area for breakfast. My husband ordered a slice of coffee crumb cake - it was delicious! Soft and tasty with a nice crunchy topping. This is a great place for a quick bite to eat."
1,I had to give this place two stars because I came once and it was good and once and it was terrible.\n\nThe first time was right before closing so they were fast and wanted me out of there. Efficient and he girl gave me a free drink.\n\nI came at 4PM during the week and they had an ancient lady workings the cash register with 7 people in line. I finally asked for another cashier and they brought out an equally old cashier. I'm sorry but when you are busy then you need quick cashiers.\n\nIt was painfully slow. The only reason I stayed is because I wanted a cookie.\n\nGet your act together.
4,"I LOVE this Petsmart! I shop here, adopted my cat and my dog here, use the grooming salon (well, not personally) and just really like everything about it and its employees! They really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need."
0,"The groomers there werent very nice to my dog, hes very sweet and well behaved. When I got my cat groomed she still had loose hairs all over her. However, there hours are great! 8 am-8 pm. It cost about $65 bucks to bathe and groom my cat. More money for my dogs."
3,This place is pretty good. I was surprised. The service was just ok though.
2,Had great service here but the food was nothing special & the atmosphere wasn't either. Unless you are drinking beer & watching sports there really is no reason to be here.
1,"Ick. Surprised this location has not been closed. There is seldom anyone there, the food is terrible and smells like dirty wet towels when you first walk in. Attention health dept, time for a spot check."
0,"Not really a fan of this place, decided to go because my friend and seen a 2 for 1 deal which was an entree and an appetizer or dessert for $10. So we thought why not. I had a house salad, and the chicken brushetta pasta. The chicken on the the pasta was not fresh tasted like cardboard. Will not be going back."
1,"Yet again I had to go to this place and yet again I come up with the same question\n\"" WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SERVING WATER IN THOSE SMUDGY BOTTLES??\""\nand YES! yet again i saw some floaters in my water....i would make this a 1 star review if not for the chicken marsala and hot complimentary bread"
1,The food was awful. My mushroom ravioli was rubbery and so unappetizing looking they should have been ashamed to let it out of the kitchen. My daughters chicken was so overcooked she could not cut it. The waiter told us we should have sent it back but he did not come back to check on us. Will never go back to this location again. Stay away there are a lot of other restaurants nearby try one of those
4,I have been going to rebeckha lafferty for years..best at cutting very thick hair and colors knowledge is great. .only go to her. .If she is off wait till she is available. ..
3,"Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes.  Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers.  It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order.  Must try!"
3,"Want a unique date night?  Craving for something to do on your own?  Want to have an avenue to express your inner artistic abilities?  OK, here you go!\n\nVery interesting concept: Pick a piece of pottery, think of what you would like to design on it, you can draw your idea on with pencil, go grab your paints, brush, sponges, or stencils, and away you go.  They will then fire & glaze it, ready to pick up your masterpeice in a few days,\n\nA great place to zen out and leave all your stress and worries at the door.  \n\nGood for a keepsake, special gift, 1-of-a-kind conversation piece, or create a memory.\n\n1 star lost for the very annoying and extremely intrusive studio \""helper\"" which I will leave un-named.  Kinda ruined alot of the experience.  I should say that if you need assistance, you can have it, but when you do NOT need it, well, please leave us alone - ie: i f you are in Barnes & Noble, you don't need a clerk to repeatedly come up to you every 10 mins to ask if you are going to buy that book or they read it, or do you want a better suggestion..... ect."
3,Such a fun place for kids and parents both.  Great place to make gifts or just to have fun.  So fun.
2,"This place is always busy and if you come to late in the day you may find that the bagel selection is... well, it might suck my after the lunch rush.  The food is good and the manager is friendly.... but I'm always a little disappointed in how often I see the employees talking among themselves instead of getting the orders out.  I also don't like to see how messy the floor is behind the counter- they could use some extra umph in the cleaning department to keep things looking sanitary.  The bagel crumbs and crumpled napkins that often litter the floor behind the counter is a definite turn off."
0,Do not go for a car wash or a oil change. I went twice to give them a second chance. I have never gone to a car wash with such awful service my 8 year old has done a better job washing my car. I don't even know why I tipped them shame on me! I asked them to replace my air filter twice and they still couldn't get it right. I don't know how they stay in business. They kept pushing me to add all these extras. So pushy. Save you money go else where.
1,Their kitchen closes way too early !  \nLay-out of the whole place isnt good and needs to be improved.\nThere simply is something wrong with the over-all lay-out of Marcel's that doesnt make you feel at home. \n                         Rest rooms arent maintained. Always strewn with paper all over. Everything inside is Boring and DULL!\nThe place needs MAJOR MAJOR SURGERY!\nMy guess is the business is probably out for sale. To say this place sucks is an understatement!
1,Meh. I've experienced better.
3,"I have lived at Desert Club apartments now for four months and feel I've had enough time to give my opinion on the place... \n\nThe Good: Convenient location to everything in Scottsdale and highway access, gated community, the pool is never too busy and great for relaxing with nice chairs, very quiet community and I hear no noise inside my apartment (top floor though), feels safe, nicer finishes in kitchen with the tile floor and granite counter tops, quick maintenance response times, ample visitor parking in rear of complex, nice gym, staff is usually friendly and helpful. Unique floor plans with lots of cabinet space in the A2 floor plan. \n\nThe Bad: Single entrance into complex can be annoying, grassy area's in between buildings smell like urine from all the pets, pool could use a cleaning more often (leaves and debris at the bottom) and there is constantly yellow caution tape around the hot tub (not sure what's that about), almost non-existent resident functions, efficiency of the AC in my 3rd story unit seems poor (the AC is always running), glass block window in A2 floor plan lets in a lot of heat (my apartment faces East and West), breezeways and stairs are sometimes littered and are dirty with accidents from pets. The kitchen has a spray/stream faucet which comes in handy a lot but there is no option to add a water filter. The water here isn't too great so I've had to resort to buying bottled water.\n\nTips: Before moving in, make sure you get the code to the entrance gate if you are moving in early in the morning or on a weekend. We didn't have the gate code for the moving company and it caused a bit of nightmare. Also, for efficiency sake, I'd request a North or South facing apartment.  \n\nSummary: I looked at a LOT of places in Scottsdale for an apartment before settling at Desert Club and I would probably do it all over again if I had to. The minor items on the bad list, though there are several, aren't enough to outweigh the good of the place for me so I generally enjoy living here.  I almost chose Barossa across the street but opted for Desert Club because of the larger pool and the additional square footage in the one bedroom."
0,"Do not rent at at this place or at least do not rent the apartments over the garages.  They are poorly insulated if done at all and with the heat from the cars and being on the second floor, AC can go over $300 per month for a studio apartment!!  We complained to management, they didn't care at all or even acknowledge the issue.  Then they charged for 'carpet cleaning' on move out.  The apartment had WHITE CARPET.  This was totally bogus, it was the same condition as when we moved in, nothing out of ordinary.  Only stayed one lease period, could not afford the excessive AC charges."
4,"Roy's is a perennial favorite on my hit parade.  When restaurant week occasioned itself upon us, I saw Roy's on the list and said let's go!\n\nThere are two things that make for a great restaurant:  1.)  product (the food), 2.) process (the experience).\n\nFrom the moment we walked in the place, every single member of the Roy's team went out of their way to make us feel like royalty.  Secondly, the moment we sat down, a very deliberate system came into play that leaves you feeling very well cared for.\n\nThis is what the experience should be like!  The setting was beautiful, and the food was out of this world.\n\nAnd....of course...the chocolate souffle.  If it were possible for one's mouth to experience an orgasm, Roy's chocolate souffle would be the ticket.\n\nGreat job Roy's!"
4,"Lobster pot stickers, divine Butterfish, seared Ahi , chocolate lava cake all to die for!!"
0,"Worst birthday experience of my life. \nThere were eight of us who came from the resort pool to the patio for Aloha Hour, then dinner. First we were told that the patio was closed (on what had to have been the most gorgeous evening of the summer.) That's fine. Inside, it's a little too fancy for our pool-wear, although all but one of us had coverups. So we are decoding what to do, when a server tells us we are dressed inappropriately. We say that we know...we were going to eat on the patio and now we are just standing there deciding what to do (ps the restaurant is completely empty except for about five servers who are glaring at us.) \nWe go back outside where my elderly father needs to sit down for a moment. Normally after a chilly reception like that I would have left immediately, but my dad can't walk very far, the rest of the party is hungry, and we had really been looking forward to Roy's. \nThe server comes outside where we are standing (except for my dad who had to sit down) and confronts us. I explain that its my birthday, that we have been loyal Roy's customers in Hawaii and here, and that we just want to have a nice meal.  I explained that we weren't trying to offend anyone and that there really aren't any other customers to offend right now any way. She tells me that I'm being rude and that she is letting us know about the dress code because she doesn't want her manager to see us and come confront us (so instead she does the honors, I guess.) I am so astounded by how outright MEAN this woman is. It baffling. She looks like she's early 50's or so...you think she would know how to handle a dress code concern better. \nSo the manager comes out, tries to smooth things over, tells us we're all dressed just fine except for one of our well-behaved kids, who needs a shirt with sleeves. Reminds us that there's a sign that says that too (expert managers always point to the policy) Tells us that we won't have that woman as our server. She'll give us \""Debbie, who is fantastic like me.\"" Okay. Ha ha. Come in. \nWe get $100+ worth of appetizers and drinks because the full menu is not available yet. Debbie the server is fine. We watch the sun go down through the window. The only good thing about sitting inside is the fantastic live music by Jared Blackstone.  There is also a a very nice server named Tanner, who had brought my dad some water while we were standing on the patio. He comes over and apologizes to us because he has witnessed this whole thing. He's a class act. Kudos to him and I hope he can get a job at an establishment that values service as much as he does. \nThe manager never came back by our table. We didn't stay for dinner. Instead we walked across the resort to The Blue Sage, where we enjoyed a great meal on the patio on a  gorgeous night. \nThe experience at Roy's was one of the all-time worst I have ever experienced in my life."
2,"My coworkers and I are here for a convention and came here for Dinner last night. \n\nOur waiters Scott and Adele were quick, attentive and really nice. \n\nWe have the pork belly dim sum as an appetizer, which was phenomenal! For my entree I had the hanger steak. For the price, I expected a bit more to it. When it says it includes carrots and peas, they meant one carrot and one pea :p But the steak was cooked perfectly ad tasted amazing. The rest of the group really enjoyed their dishes as well.  \n\nMargarita tasted good, but was a little weak, I stuck to beer after having one. Per my coworkers they had a great Pinot. \n\nHad a really nice time :)"
1,"So slow! Waited 30 min between courses. Entree dish was barely warm- the manager removed the charge for the dish. Food was good, not the service I expect at its price point. Disappointing."
1,"Once again I am completely \""under-whelmed\"".\nFor the price point you'd believe it would be fantastic. Not so much.\nOrdered the butter fish which is a Roy's classic and received a \""new\"" version on the presentation.\nThe fish was flat and a tad overcooked and the rice was in a shaped triangle.\nWhere was the version atop the forbidden rice?\nTook two colleagues there for a dinner after a meeting and the bill was right around $300.\nI am quite sure for $100/person there are better choices in the valley.\nIt seems on more than one occasion at the 2 Roy's in the valley the service has been off. Not, bad per se. Just not what you would expect for a place of this \""expected\"" caliber. A good example would be; the waiter in a clueless fashion interrupting speakers in a business meeting to ask \""how the bread tastes?\""\nWhy? because your server just started at Roy's last week.\nPerhaps they have issues with employee turnover as well.\n\nOver priced, unprofessional, simply just not that good."
2,"ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude."
3,"I've recently become a huge pho fan, so I was excited to try Tea Light Cafe, which is right in my neighborhood.  While it wasn't quite as authentic as a place I was recently turned onto in Downtown LA, it was still very tasty  and fresh.  A cup of hot tea and a bowl of pho is always wonderful on a cold winter day!  At $8, it's enough for two to share, or it can be two meals for one person!  We don't exactly have a lot of independent ethnic restaurants in this area, so it's nice to have Tea Light Cafe serving up yummy Vietnamese food - hopefully people will continue to support it."
1,"Ate here for lunch the other day, food was pretty meh. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could, the spring rolls were very nice and stuffed with shrimp. However, the order of chicken I had was completely dried out -- it was seriously like eating chalk. The flavor was ok, I guess, but the meat was so overcooked it was impossible to really tell."
3,"Love Tea Lite but will now frequent much less.  Why, because they stopped making one of the best sandwiches on the planet.  As of about a week ago, we were told by the person running the counter that they have stopped making their version of the Banh Mi, which is a great chicken sandwich.  Was told it was too difficult to make.  Why you would take the item off of the menu that Phoenix Magazine listed as one of the 20 best sandwiches in the city doesn't make sense.  Bring it back!"
4,"Worth everything you pay here.  I used to drive about 7 miles for Pho, but now I come here, less than a mile away for my fix.  I love to order the beef special with rare beef, brisket, and beef balls to go.  Their broth is really clear.  Their egg rolls are really good as well.  Worth the try if you live in the area!"
4,"I have nothing to compare this too as I've never eaten Vietnamese food ever. I've also never tried pho. Stopped here for lunch on a whim and it was delicious! The place was packed (good sign) and my husband and I got the sampler thing (pho, egg and spring roll). It was all yummy although we had no idea what to do with all the extra - the sauces and things that came on the side- we needed a tutorial! We will be back!!"
4,"I will ONLY go to Harkins theaters and this one is the best yet. Harkins has fresh popcorn and yummy butter flavoring, kind employees, and super clean theaters. AMC on the other hand as rude workers, dirty carpet, old theaters, and GROSS popcorn. Even the super comfy AMC seats can't entice me. It's Harkins all the way.\n\nThis theater is super big and I never wait more than 5 minutes for concessions no matter how long the line is -- they have like 10 concession counters. Of course it is movie theater pricing ($6 for a bottle of water) but Harkins has a loyalty program: if you buy their reusable plastic cup for like $6 you can get refills for $1 all year. I'm in. If you really want to show off you can get a Harkins t-shirt and if you wear it you get a free medium popcorn. \n\nI go to the movies a lot and this would save me money but I don't want to wear the shirt. Some people do though, more power to them.\n\nBathrooms are always spotless.\n\nGreat location next to many restaurants and causal dining places. \n\nLOVE HARKINS"
4,"Good theatre, got tickets and good seats... Air conditioning worked well, bathrooms were very clean... And so were the floors in the theatre."
4,"Absolutely love the service at Audi Scottsdale! I own my 2nd Audi and highly recommend. Wouldn't own any other brand. My service consultant, Jason, is the best!"
4,"After submitting my concerns via Yelp, I was contacted by Alane B. She got me in touch with Bobby Perich (General Manager) who offered to assist in the second party shipping issues. I was able to purchase the manuals through a local dealership and have them fix the underhood damage. I submitted my costs to the shipper and am waiting a response. In the mean time, Bobby offered to reimburse my costs should the shipper not respond. Knowing full well that this truly is a second party (shipper) issue, I fully appreciate the response and attention from the general manager in resolving this problem. Very much in tune with the service I would expect from a high quality dealership."
2,"When is Land Rover fast? When they're processing my payment. When do they take their sweet time? The remainder of the time. BTW, that free coffee is gonna cost you."
0,"I am a frequent Subway patron, but I will not patron this franchise again.\n\nI am also a supporter of our local High School sports teams. When I presented a discount card from Boulder Creek HS, the manager REFUSED to honor the card.\n\nPlease do not support this Subway franchise as they do not support our schools and sports teams."
0,The urgent care here is ridiculous!! Waited for over a hour and  a half just to see the nurse practitioner who was only in here for 5 minutes tops. I wouldn't have come here but this was the only urgent care open on Sunday.
2,I like the pan fried dumplings and the hot and sour soup. The entree plates are huge and made to share. Staff is friendly and the drinks are good.
2,"This place is hit or miss. The service is usually subpar. Food as mentioned above is different each time. The chicken fried rice is either oily or dry. The orange chicken is very chewy which I do not enjoy. Prices are average I'd say. Overall not bad, but certainly not the best place for Chinese food in North Phoenix"
3,"Unlike the last review I wrote about an unconventional outlet mall, Outlets At Anthem is EXACTLY what you'd think of when you think 'Outlet Mall'. It is one mammoth of a shopping center and it doesn't matter WHO you are - you will mos' def.' find *something* that catches your eye in any one of the multiple stores (total understatement) located in this complex.\n\nWhether you're looking for Gap, BCBG, Banana Republic, Book Warehouse, Calvin Klein, Bose, Claire's, Kitchen Collection, Jockey, Polo, Perfumania, Ultra Diamonds, Vans, or Yogurberry (JUST TO NAME A FEW), the Outlets At Anthem have got you covered.\n\nBeing the avid swimmer that I am, I hit up the Nike Factory store and bought two (count 'em) TWO Nike swimsuits for $60. Usually one runs me about $75. Can I get a holllllllaaaa?!?!?!?\n\nThe only reason I *had* to take off a star is because this is an outdoor outlet mall, and in a place like Arizona, that is INSANE. The weather was SO scorching hot that I would have PAID an entry fee to shop at an indoor, AIR CONDITIONED shopping complex.\n\nAh well, still got the goods at the outlet prices. Can't complain...too much ;)"
1,place is very clean:) Banana Republic is the only store I really go to here.
4,Very friendly people who work here. They were so great with my kids! Definitely will be back.
1,"Went for dinner tonight at the restaurant, usually just get delivery which is ok... I will probably not eat here again and stick with  delivery. The pizza took forever and was undercooked, no crunch to it. We asked for pineapples and they put so many on it was just overwhelming. Also the bathrooms are just gross, looked like they hadn't been cleaned, ever. I was pretty bummed about the whole experience, what a waste of calories."
0,"If you look at my other reviews, you'll see I very rarely give a restaurant 1 bubble. And for local places in my community, I will often say nothing if I don't have anything nice to say. But this experience was so thoroughly terrible I'm making an exception. A friend visiting from out of state was thrilled we had a Hungry Howie's in our town as this was her favorite pizza chain back east. Since we had not had a chance to try it yet, we gave it a go. First we tried ordering on the web site but it does not allow you to select a flavor for the crust - that seemed odd considering how much they promote this and rely on it to differentiate themselves from all the other pizza joints in town. OK, so we tried calling our order in. We had seen the specials on the web site, but when we asked for it on the phone, a teenage-sounding guy told us they didn't have that promotion and it would cost roughly double the advertised price. At this point I started getting annoyed, but I kept calm and ordered on, after all, our friend loves this place, maybe the food will redeem it. Since we were already out and about, we declined delivery and went in to get it. Imagine my surprise when we saw the front of the building was plastered with large advertisements exactly matching what we saw online. There were also posters and stands inside the restaurant showing these same deals. Really?! How could this guy NOT know the specials they offer? Does he come in through the back door every day? Does he never look left when he answers the phone? I probably should have said something, but at this point it was worth the extra money to not prolong any interaction with this person. I paid and left. At home we realized they never offered us a choice of dipping sauces for the bread sticks and that the pizza did not have the flavored crust we ordered. The bread sticks were burnt and tough. We tried to eat a couple but ended up throwing them away, which if you know me is atypical - I will eat terrible food rather than waste it, but this was beyond edible. The pizza was cooked to perfection, but the cheap ingredients and \""canned\"" tasting sauce put it below average. Our friend assured us she has never had this experience at the other stores she has been to, that even the web site is better for other stores, and that we just have a bad one. Until this location brings its customer service and product quality up to the standards the chain apparently sets for its other locations, there is no chance we will be returning."
4,From Downtown Chicago so used to great hair care... But this place reminded me of home... Linda is phenomenal and after stepping a few feet from the door I got a compliment on my hair.... I highly recommend this to anybody who's looking for great and relaxing haircut..
3,"Great pizza place in the area...was in town for business.  They have specials Monday-Wednesday I believe.  Got a large pizza for $9.99.  Great tasting and service was great.  They have TV's, so you are able to watch a sporting game while enjoy a slice a pizza.  They also sell pizza by the slice as well."
1,shitty pizza.. shittier customer service.. do your self a favor and order from Big Boy's. Bitch.. I am a customer. Don't get all snotty with me on the phone for asking questions about your specials.
1,"Went here recently for the first time. It was okay. Unfortunately I ordered pasta. It was overcooked, and didn't even have the mushrooms and olives that I asked for. My husband got pizza, and I tried a bite. The pizza was good. We did have the garlic knots as an appetizer, and they were pretty good. Customer service was meh. The girl Aleah, who was serving us kept smiling like she was trying not to laugh. It made for a really awkward dinner. I'd come back for the pizza, but nothing else. I probably won't be back though. If I'm going out for pizza, I go to Venezia's Pizzeria. Their pizza is amazing, good prices, and their staff is really friendly."

1,"1 star for the exceptional service & extra slow food preperation. \n2 stars for the extra greasy pizza\n\nI purchased a groupon for this place and finally got around to using it. I wasn't in a hurry to use it even tho it had an expiration date because I called, spoke to somebody & they ensured me it wouldn't expire. \n\nWalked into this place and had a hard time choosing the least dirty booth/table but finally made my choice and wiped off the left overs crumbs left on the table and seats. I guess with only 1 waitress it's hard to take care of a couple tables so we had to wait a good 15-20 for a greeting. No big deal..... It just meant we had plenty of time to second guess our ordering decisions. Which was a good thing because they were out of this & out of that on an early Saturday night. Really?? We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and it took over an hour for them to prepare and deliver it to our table. There was enough grease on this pizza to save the govt millions in vehicle maintenance but since I'm not in the habit of bailing out the fat cats I quickly used an entire trees worth of napkins to solve the issue. A little grated cheese, stale crushed peppers, garlic salt and voialla & edible pizza. The pizza actually has good flavor and I enjoyed the crust which normally I don't. I didn't want to chance my luck with letting down my taste buds so we opted out on the potentially fake Italian desert. \n\nSo here's where Bouno's helped establish their excellent one star review with me. The waitress brought the bill & I gave here my groupon. She quickly made an excuse on not taking the groupon because it was expired & I showed her on the groupon where it says it NEVER EXPIRES so she took it to her boss. A $12 dollar groupon discount turned into a $6 discount. Nothing makes me more sadder than a business not living up to their offer. Don't put it out there if you have no honor. Well, to wrap this up I'm gonna say good by to Bouno's & wish them luck cuz they're gonna need it if they plan on staying in business with such awesomeness."
3,"Despite browsing through the more recent negative reviews. I came back hoping to have the same experience I did 10 years ago as a Dobson high student. \n\nNothing has changed pizza wise. I was relieved! It's clean and looks the same as it always did. It's clearly under new management but is NOT an issue fellow former Buono's customers. \n\nGreat NY style pizza, it's a fav!"
0,"Is it possible to have two horrible experiences in one weekend? Damn. \n\nFuck my life. It is.\n\nI have family in town, so naturally, everyone wants to go to the most ethnic place possible. We go to the Copper Kettle in Mesa. I'd been here before and my experience wasn't bad. I liked it. This time around though, I felt like I wanted to kill myself.\n\nWe walked in, it was busy. Great. Good sign, that must mean that people like the place. I noticed there was a buffet in the back. All the food looked fucking miserable. Of course it did. It's a buffet. What self-respecting person would eat ethnic food at a buffet?\n\nIn any case, we are seated. 15 minutes later, we get 3 menus. 5 people at the table. 9 minutes after that, we all get plastic coke classes of ice water (I shouldve been conservative on this 98 degree day, because this was the only water I got-- no refill). \n\nWe ordered our food, and it was fucking useless. The chicken was undercooked. My mom ordered the beef chapli kabob, which came out to the table sizzling....seemingly great, only to make EVERYONE in the restaurant cough, and give us dirty looks.\n\nMy poor aunt had specially requested no chilis in her dish, and of course, her dish had EXTRA chili. My aunt requested all of this in Hindi and Urdu....native languages to these people. What the shit is wrong here?\n\nAfter we got our food, no one came back to check up on us. On this hot spring day, we never got refills on our waters. I guess now I know what it's like to be welcomed to the desert. Thanks a lot Copper Kettle. \n\nAlso, with the undercooked chicken, my family and I are probably going to get sick from salmonella. Kidding. But seriously.\n\nI am Indian and my Dad was born in Pakistan. I can judge this food and service. I can't come back here. This place is a joke. \n\nGetting a server was like what I imagine it's like to hail a cab in New York City. They see you. They know you ask for their help. They know you are a paying customer, but don't really care about you and go on with their day.\n\nBottom line....\n\nNo respectable Indian or Pakistani should/would eat here. Or Human for that matter.\n\nNever coming back.\n\nThere has got to be a better place in town..."
1,"Went tonight for a takeout order so we could watch Monday Night Football. Order and paid for extra celery & blue cheese( price went up to $1 each! )... Got the order and took it home. The wife wanted to know where the blue cheese was. There was four celery and ONE blue cheese! I was pissed and called them. I drove 3 miles back, and Chelsey who took the order and answered when I called back, told me I was wrong and she personally put three blue cheese in the bag. \n\nDo not ever tell a customer he is a liar. This is what she did. I am about ready to call the manager. My friends do not go here anymore but I've always defended this restaurant. Tonight makes me want to change my mind."
3,Always great wings. I went to watch UFC with some friends. Staff is friendly drinks a plenty. good staff @ this loc.  no complaints.  my compliments
2,"The bar of this place is the part you need to hang out in if you go here. The front dining area is lame so i was hesitant to even go in the back and check out the bar.  However, i was rather surprised. Nice big area..with a crap load of t.v's. \n\nGood happy hour prices. B/f tried about 6 different kinds of the wings(the day we went each wing was 39 cents) they have all different kinds of sauces, hot, strawberry, garlic, orange etc..\nhe was not that impressed with them(he eats a lot of wings, sl his expectations are just a little high) i thought they were alright. the pizza was however, very good..better than the wings.\n\ni will be back..cool spot to catch a game and grab a drink."
0,"I wish I could give them less than one star, WORST service I have ever received somewhere. I am a waitress my self so I know the struggle and how not to be hard on them if it's busy. Well there was only two other tables besides mine. She would just pop her head around the wall and say cool and walk away she would give us refills and she wouldn't bring us our food when it came out we saw it just sitting there for a few minutes and she had other people bring us our food she really didn't do anything. She was playing on her phone when she took our freaking orders for crying out loud. Now the food on the hand was good the pasookie was perfect as always and the wings were alright if they had a little bit more sauce on them (: but I'm not sure I will be back to this particular one only because you could tell the servers didn't want to be there they were unhappy with their guests and we're trying to get rid of them."
2,Went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show. It was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to Pink Floyd music. After the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon. First friday of every month!
1,"I never thought my favorite class would be the gym, but I absolutely love it! The people who oversee the gym are very friendly, and encouraging. I have never seen too many people in the gym, it has always had a dozen or so or less in it, so it is comfortable. If you are thinking about a routine, this is a great place to get your start, they also have other classes you may like, such as yoga,track, belly-dancing or karate.  If it wasn't for the gym, I would have been long gone from this school from hell. \n\nAs you can probably see by now, I am not a complete fan of the academics at MCC. I have taken around 30 credits here, and although I have a pretty decent GPA, some of the part-time online instructors are fairly 'feral' towards students( for some odd reason) which just messes up my degree plans.\n\n  MCC has a 16% (or was it 14%?)  graduation rate. The lowest in the nation. You can see the statistics yourself if you log into your FAFSA. Who needs a degree- right? Obviously this is play time. (sarcasm) \n\nI'd say avoid the Religion at MCC, that one is a joke- save your money! I think it is ran by a bunch of secular-rabid-lesbian atheists."
0,"Terrible customer service, they close 10 mins early as customers are getting out and turn them away, spend your money anywhere else."
0,"Lousy, dirty, filthy, B E D  BUGS! And they blame them on you!!! MR. BRIAN the sooo-called manager - for lack of a better word, which is vulgar. This man is very unprofessional. I cannot believe he still  is employed with all the bad reviews about him. He threw us out because he was caught with a BED BUG problem. Calling us liars - what is that! They admitted fault and tried to rectify the situation by being even more rude and hateful.  I think the whole place should be inspected. In fact, I am calling the better business bureau, the health department and 3 on your side. DO NOT GO HERE! It is full of criminals and FILTH! They try to hide all the filth with new grass! - He gave us a card for $15.00 and told us to do all our own laundry and clean our own room after he had 2 people invade our privacy to do inspections and to spray or treat - so they say. I contacted the health department and BED BUGS have been all but irradicated and if there is BED BUGS in 1 room they are in others. 1 bed bug can have 100's of babies. OH MY GOSH! RUN FROM BUDGET SUITES IN PHOENIX and the severely disabled ability of the management staff. RUDE, UNHEALTHY PLACE TO STAY. Keep your kids away from disease! I bet the moral-LESS man has rented that room again being not fully treated. He says \""I'm a business man.\"" Try again MR. BRIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you are lousy. And how about not sleeping with the dusty gals you give rooms too. YOU SCUM!!!"
1,"It seems to me a strange decision to take your typical vietnamese restaurant and turn it into a not-so-typical vietnamese restaurant and then raise the prices, but not the quality. The old vietnamese restaurant that stood in the same place was typical and nothing to write home about. When I saw the new place pop up a couple years ago, I was intrigued but never thought to go there, being that there are at least 2 restaurants in that same plaza that I would much rather go to. But I had the urge to try it with a friend and I came out unimpressed. There are about 5-7 Vietnamese places within a 10 mile radius of this place and I find it strange that their prices are higher than all the rest. Their soup in pho wasnt especially good, though it was passable. Their rice dishes seemed to be on par with others but for the price you would expect more. The only redeeming thing about this place would be the more contemporary decor that you don't see in most other Vietnamese places. It was cleaner and from the table setup you could tell they are aiming for a higher echelon of clientele.  \n\nThe bottom line: The food was ok. The ambience was better than most. If you care about such things then this may be the place for you. As for me, I'd rather save a couple bucks, endure a nondescript dining area and go to one of the many places just minutes away."
0,"I wouldn't give any stars for this dump of a place ... The floor was dirty , some of there machines were broken  &  filthy .. No manager or workers to be found & when they are around , they are rude  ..  I've been to this place twice and would never come back . I would rather pay more $ at a place that is clean and have friendly  helpful workers . I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy ......."
4,"Went by the other day and it is closed.  Unfortunate, now I don't know where to get the delicious sour cherries in syrup I love with greek yogurt."
4,"Hands down 5 stars, did not even need to think twice about it. (this does not happen often).\n\nGinormous menu and low prices. We had spare ribs, orange chicken, rice and our meals also came with egg drop soup AND salad and we also got two orders of crab puffs  all for $20 freakin bucks.  \n\neverything was deeeelicious. i mean everything. nothing but silence as we ate. \n\nThe man working while we were there was just a delight, he was helpful, nice( some kid(who was clearly under the influence of something) told this poor guy his whole life story, let him use the restaurant phone and changed out $11 in change to give him dollar bills) and funny(he just had this grin on his face the whole time the kid was telling him his problems) hahahah... it was def entertainment while eating.\n\nAlso i love that it is like a fast food kind of joint, but the decor inside does not represent that.\n\ni highly recommend!!"
1,My chicken was so plain. I was upset with it. It was just teriyaki chicken. Hard to mess up. I doubt ill be back. It is a relaxing place tho. Just dont go for the food.
3,"THE BEST crab puffs, hands down."
0,"A friend of mine highly recommended Stockton Dermatology, so I called to schedule a check up with Dr. Stockton after finding a strange new spot on my skin.  I also wanted to have an overall exam, since I had never been to a dermatologist before.  The staff said that there was not an appointment available for 2 months.  I was worried about waiting so long since I had something I needed checked asap, but made the appointment anyway.  When I showed up for my appointment 2 months later, it turns out I was scheduled with a physicians assistant, not even Dr.Stockton.  She was absolutely horrible.  I had several areas of concern, and she had NO idea what ANY of them were.  I also wanted to have a small skin tag removed, and she said she I would have to come back for another appointment to do that.  I scheduled the next appointment, but when I found out that it was going to cost $600+ to have a small skin tag removed, I cancelled.  I had a horrible experience with this office."
3,"For a municipal course, Dobson Ranch is tops.  This is the place to go for a good, cheap afternoon round of golf during the summer.  It's a well maintained traditional course, with large trees lining the fairways, and grass everywhere.  Dobson Ranch is great for beginners, as the ball is playable from anywhere that is not in someone's backyard.  It's slice-friendly too, with most of the out of bounds areas sitting to the left of the fairways.\n\nDobson Ranch is a standard par 72, except instead of having 4 par 3s, 10 par 4s, and 4 par 5s; it has 5 par 3s, 8 par 4s, and 5 par 5s.\n\nAt only $10 to walk on a summer afternoon, this is one of the best values in the Valley."
2,"Dude, this place ain't half bad and I didn't even have the munchies!  You don't have to be stoned here to enjoy the food.\n\nA variety of sandwiches and such served up with a smile and a side of chips or something.  Doritos anyone?"
3,"Never had a bad eating experience at Cheba Hut! The food is Delicious, and the subs are TOASTED... Yummm!!! a must-try if you are new to Mesa or if you've just never been to Cheba Hut before!"
4,Best Subs around period.
4,"I love Cheba hut. My personal favorite is the White Widow. Its the best chicken bacon ranch sandwich out there. Their meat and dressings are prepared fresh daily.  Great spot for lunch breaks but be prepared to wait, the line will be long."
4,"Service was fast, friendly and everything was so much fun . And the sandwich I ordered was phenomenally good. I should have gotten the 4 inch because that was all I could finish. When I saw the picture of Ice Cube on the ice machine I thought I would lose it. Hilarious!"
0,"the restaurant formerly known as the best hong kong.\n\nwhat happened to this place?  this used to be our go-to chinese restaurant in the east valley!\n\nthe food has gone down hill and the service which used to be 3/5 has gone to 1/5.\n\nthere was this young college age kid/busboy/waiter (who knows, he could have been older, just add 10 years to what you think they are) who actually chased us out the door and demanded that we leave 15% tip when we only left 10%....what a dufus\n\nhello, we're trying to send you a message idiot.  i guess the best message is to not eat there and tell 100 other people to do the same\n\nyou shall be called \""Worst Hong Kong\"""
0,"I used to go here often when I went to MCC.  I admit that the food was pretty good, but the owner ruined the entire experience for me.  At the time, I was learning Japanese and wanted to try it out in an actual setting.  He yelled at me the first time I tried and told me to speak English.\n\nAnother instance, and the real reason I don't go back there, is when a friend of mine went to eat there.  After he finished, he said \""Gochisousamadeshita\"" (a polite saying thanking the preparer of the food for the meal) and the owner muttered under his breath \""Henna Gaijin\"" (strange foreigner).\n\nI can understand not having the patience to speak Japanese with me, but really.....insulting someone who just thanked you for the food?  That's enough for me to never return."
4,"When I arrived last night, I thought they were closed. There was only one car in the parking lot, and I assumed it was the owner's.\n\nOnce inside, I found it was worth the drive. I had the miso ramen with chicken, and I loved it. It was a gigantic bowl of flavorful broth, tender noodles, cabbage and chicken. It also came with two pieces of inari sushi. It was my first time having inari, and I liked it.\n\nAn awesome, incredibly filling dinner for about 9 dollars. I may go back tonight."
2,"We stopped in here the other day based on the Yelp reviews. We arrived to discover they were closed between lunch and dinner, but the owner saw us and opened up the shop. Score one star.\n\nThis review is based on my food only. I had chicken katsu, and thought it was decent though a little pricey. That said, it did come with some cool side dishes, so I felt in the end it was a good value. My wife and stepson like their food quite a bit, so you might have a much better experience. \n\nIt is an old business and looks it, but I don't judge on that. I only mention it for those of you who require a nice ambiance. Service started grumpily, but got better and better. Others have said that the owner appears a little stand-offish, but is really a swell guy. I'd say that is accurate. \n\nIt was hot inside, but again, we were there during their off time. I think they had the AC off until we arrived. It was uncomfortable enough that I just wanted to finish and get out and into my car's air conditioning, so I i will need to visit again during their regular hours. Next time I will try another dish also and report back. This is the sort of business I definitely want to support, so I hope to add a star or two next time around. But for now, I can only give three stars."
2,"Good bulgogi, and a spicy octopus platter I forgot the name of.  I'd visit again, but my eyes tear whenever I walk into the place- not their fault I'm allergic to *."
2,"First of all, I want to state that the food is pretty good and the portions are huge. I would've been ok with a bit less food and less pricey.\n\nI have been to this place twice for lunch with coworkers. At first I just thought the service is awful, and it takes a LONG time for the food to arrive. Eventually I realized that this place might actually be racist. If you are not asian/korean or if you come with people that are not asian/korean, you get served last. I have observed that Koreans that came in way later than we did were already served with their meals while we waited, waited, and waited some more. This observation really hit home when it was independently verified by a friend as he mentioned he observed the exact same thing. And he's half Korean. So there you go. If you are not Korean, expect crappy service and get your food after all the Koreans have been served, even if they came in way after you did.\n\nUpdate: We did an experiment the other night after playing tennis with a group of friends. We went there with majority of asian people (3 of us asian and one non-asian person, with one that can at least pronounce the food in Korean). And surprise! Prompt service. So...food is good there, service is to be desired depending on who you go with...."
3,"This place has AWESOME kimchi Chigae, kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced. The service is hit or miss here. \n\nBut probably one of the best korean places on the east side."
1,The food is alright but the service is terrible and slow every time I come here! The waiters need to follow up on the tables for any water or banchan refills instead of just serving the food & moving on to new orders. Takamatsu in chandler has better quality  food & the best service since the manager is on the floor directing the employees.  Chodang is also better in food quality but the service can be slow at times but its not as bad as it is at hodori.
0,"So I've been to this restaurant 3 times just to make sure it wasn't me that was being rude or a jerk. \n\nSo to start off the food is just ok, nothing too spectacular but not bad, but the pricing is high for the things here, I can get it at any other Korean restaurant for way less.\n\nSo here's is why I gave the place a one star.... The service it's not nonexistent it's pure rude like I borrowed money from them and didn't pay them back!! So every time I ask them about any dish on the menu they look at me like I was crazy, like I was from another planet or something for not knowing what I was asking about was. One time I was there for lunch at 2:30 or so with a buddy of mine and I asked them if I could order the happy hour dishes that starts at 3 and naturally they said no which was understandable so we order and started to eat til 2:57 when I asked again to get something from the happy hour menu the waitress looked at me with a look the a mom would give to her child when he did something bad and replied it's not 3 at that point I wanted to het up and leave  but my buddy said wait and at least finish lunch, ok I finished stood up and asked our waitress for a togo box from behinds the counter she the replied \""for what?\""....I was so done with this place told me buddy to pay and stormed out \n\nSo for all you awesome people that read the my whole rant thank you and those who didn't.....well I STRONGLY would not recommend this place to eat maybe to get pissed off at but other then that yeah that's my two cent."
3,"I'm willing to bet that this place was a shining gem in its heyday.  Several days have passed since that day...leaving the same gem, minus a lot of the luster.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite spacious. It has a full bar to the left, a large recessed dining area in the middle (geared more towards groups), and a more secluded are to the right for smaller groups and/or couples. All three sections are quite spacious. \n\nWe happened to sit off to the right. We had a party of four and half (one three-year-old). The tables in this section were for a maximum of four people, and our daughter is FAR to tall for a high chair. Thankfully for us, where there are some bay windows facing out of the restaurant, there is a nice little padded booth created there, which turned out to be the PERFECT place for our daughter!\n\nThe menu for Serrano's is typical, but it's pretty limited. They offer the usual Mexican fare, usually in both chicken and beef (and ONE that offered shrimp). Both the quality and quantity of each dish we ordered was substantial. Suffice it to say that each member of our party left the restaurant with a take-home box.\n\nOur server was stellar. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, so if he HAD been lacking, it would have made things very awkward. But, as it happened, Christian was phenomenal! He was patient with us while we waited for the final member of our party to arrive. He was very diligent with keeping our drinks full and our table cleared.\n\nBut, the coolest thing Christian did for us was regarding dessert. You see, it was my wife's birthday, and her parents wanted to go to this restaurant for a celebratory dinner. My wife was deathly afraid that the restaurant employees were going to make her wear a sombrero and sing a song to her...and Christian almost made that happen. However, when he could see the sheer terror behind my wife's eyes at the prospect of public humiliation, he took the clue, and offered to comp her dessert. \n\nThis shopping center that houses this restaurant is practically empty. There are \""For Lease\"" signs in several of the windows. I can see why this place has stood the test of time...though, I feel that their menu could use a little updating, which is the only reason I opted for four stars instead of five for this cozy little relic."
2,"This place is a neighborhood pub and is very \""hit or miss\"". One thing I learned yesterday, if Amanda's pouring drinks, order beer. I ordered a vodka and soda. It was a very light pour. So I ordered an extra shot...which came out about 1/2\"" of vodka in a shot glass. So, the next drink, I went ahead and ordered a double. It tasted just like the first drink did BEFORE I poured the extra shot in it. And I paid $8.00 a piece for these two drinks! Last week, we met some friends there and the drinks were poured perfectly. I would have been hard pressed to even drink a double. The first time I ate there (after the new menu), I ordered a veggie burger. It was microwaved so much it was like shoe leather. The next time I went in, I avoided the veggie burger and ordered a french dip with a side salad. It was a great sandwich and the salad was fresh and crisp!! Yesterday, I went in and ordered the french dip again. \""Meh\"" is all I can say about it. And the salad had obviously been made much earlier and covered with plastic wrap because it was all squished down in the bowl in that shape. I'm sure for the local neighborhood patrons, this is all just fine because they go there to see all of the other neighborhood patrons. So, take your chances!"
2,"This store has good prices on many things, some much cheaper than Safeway and others equal to Fry's. It all depends on what you're shopping for. I prefer Fry's in my area of town though because the Albertson's by me ALWAYS smells like rotten fish and enough to make me hurl. \n\nThis location just happens to be by my friend's apartment so whenever we need something we just run in here and get the items. Very easy to get in and out of and very good customer service."
0,"They aren't willing to work with you. They don't care about their customers. I have experienced this with multiple locations. What I am going to do the day I have some free time is I am going to close my account with them. There is no point in staying with a company who couldn't  care less about thier customers. I have to deal with a lot of people who are unwilling to wotrk with you when I am at work but that doesn't excuse me from being rude. When they wouldn't help me I decided then that I was going to change which bank I use. I have no second thoughts and can not wait to research other banks and set up an account with them. It was beyond ridiculous how much time I wasted to not have them do anything. When they wouldn't help I told them that there was no way I was going to keep an account with them and that I am switching banks. I proceeded to storm out. As I said there is no point in being a customer of someone who is unwilling to help. \n\nWhen I first set up my account I was supposed to get an online account when I was supposed to get an online account. I got the information and everything but when I tried to sign into it I wasn't able to access it. I asked multiple times to be able to gethelp about it and no one every got back to me.I recently asked again and they said they would give me a number to call, which I never get recieved. \n\nTo put the above paragraphs shortly: screw them. Do not get an account with them because you will be disappointed in the service and the bank as well."
3,"This unlikely little club is considered to be one of the best places in the Valley to catch local bands. It's hard to believe this place is in sleepy Mesa!\n\nThe food is good and the selection is HUGE: Pizza, Calzones, sandwiches, Gyros, subs, burgers, steaks, and Mexican food. Watch out though-- cheap drinks and live music can make this place a madhouse!"
0,"The worst meal I've had in a long time and the most expensive disappointment ever. We went early on Sunday and were served day old food -bread & fish & all got sick... with a bill of $114 dollars for 3 of us.  I had an appetizer & house salad.\n The house salad consisted of 1/3 cup of greens and one slice of a plum tomato - are you kidding me !!! The eggplant parmesean consisted of one piece - 1/3\"" slice of a medium eggplant, cut lengthwise, topped w/ one generous ladle of heated up, uncooked crushed tomato with basil and 3 oz of cheese. It was $16.95.\n My friend got the chef's special - salmon, about 6-8 oz with 4 shaved strips of zucchini, 2 slices of plum tomato, 2 overcooked shrimp and some olives and a house salad. Her wine was fabulous though.\n My other friend got soup & dinner portion of lasagna & it was the size of a single thin burrito on a lunch menu at a Mexican restaurant. \n After reading the other comments, we were really excited to go and were distressed by the experience. We were going to come home and eat but were not feeling well by the time we arrived."
2,"We had a Restaurant.com coupon to use at this restaurant so we thought we'd give it a try.  Since we were with another couple, we asked as we typically do, for separate couple checks.  The waiter told us 'the computer won't let me do that, but I'll split it for you.\""  We proceeded to order and were pleased with the service, as well as the delicious breads and compound butter (which arrived soft enough to spread rather than rock hard).  Two of us ordered the sea bass special - delicious!  The veal marsala was good (not the best we've had) as was the veal francese.  The waiter offered us a complimentary sambuca which we accepted.  When the bill came, he had automatically added a 20% gratuity (for a table of 4??) and subtracted the Restaurant.com coupon from the total bill.  Let me add, this WAS NOT a computer generated bill - it was handwritten.  Will someone please explain why it is so difficult to do what customers ask and provide separate checks? We decided to check the bill over and found that we had been overcharged for a glass of wine.  The waiter fixed it and apologized.    It was a pleasant enough dining experience, however, for the most part, we felt it was overpriced and we don't appreciate the aforementioned refusal to honor a customer's request.  We most probably won't go back as there are many other restaurants to choose from!"
1,"Stayed there while visiting family.  Not sure why they would call it a resort but it does have a large pool and space.\n\nRoom was standard Best western, nothing fancy, poor lighting, roomy and free breakfast.  Smores by the outdoor firepit at night (nice touch).  \n\nProbably a great place for families as it seemed like a safe place for kids to gather in the courtyard and play in the pool.  Restaurant had okay food with great prices.  \n\nBut would like to have better lighting for business and for putting on makeup.  Felt like I was working in the dark. It was a great place for my cousins and I to sit around the firepit and get caught up on all the family gossip. \n\nThere is a well know franchise coffee place in walking distance from the \""resort\"".  Oh and the water is very nasty.  And am a little concerned about bedspreads and blankets are reused for every customer.  The central air seemed not very effective.\n\nBut for a large group with lots of kids, you can not beat the price and ammenities."
0,"If there was negative rating I would give them negative 10 for lack of politeness, and costumer service !!!!! I checked in and went to my room with all my luggage only to find out they gave me an occupied room!!!!! When I went back to the lobby... There was no apology or anything \""we can give you another room if you want\"" what the F*** you think???? I sure don't want to stay in a dirty room!!! So I told them I would just like to cancel my reservation and go somewhere we and they would not cancel my reservation and tell me I have to cancel my through hotel.com!!!! I expected them to say sorry for your inconvenience let me give you..... To make it up!!! The hallway smelled like wet mold!!!!! I strongly recommend you not to make your reservation  because they didn't deliver the service that was advertised."
2,Yummy! Fresh food and good service! I had the castroville omlette. Tasty! I do wish they has hasbrowns instead of diced potatoes but that is just my preference. Our server was friendly and definitey took care of us. We went on a sunday and it was pretty busy but we didnt suffer from that at all. Overall good experience.
2,"I placed an order a few weeks ago and went to pick it up and the manager was busy taking a phone call when I arrived. I kept trying to make eye contact with the other person working who was about 15 feet behind the manager making pizzas. I could just feel my pizza losing its delicious temperature as the minutes passed by. After several minutes of trying to get the other employees attention the manager finally put the person whom he was speaking to on the phone on hold and came to get my debit card to pay for the pizza. The food was good, and thanks to the manager who actually cared about me getting my food when it was hot I give this place 3 stars. I rarely eat pizza but when I do I want it hot, fast and cheap. Howies usually does all 3, but 2 out of 3 for a pizza joint is unacceptable."
1,"It definitely depends on what you are looking for.  This store was recommended to me by my daughter's soon to be violin teacher.  Unfortunately, the staff member that helped me didn't seem to have a clue about violin's.  I asked the staff member a number of questions regarding the violin and the proper way of fitting a child for renting one and he pretty much just shrugged his shoulders.  Thank goodness, we went to a previous shop whose staff seemed to have a vast knowledge of violin's and measured her for us.  Otherwise, we would really have been up the creek at this store.  I did end up renting it from them, but only because several other stores seemed to be out of 1/8 size violin's.  Upon leaving The Music Store, I noticed a very professional looking violin store right across the street, decided to check them out and was VERY pleased with them.  Thank goodness, my contract with The Music store is month-to-month, because I will be returning it in a month and will be renting from the store across the street.  I will also be informing my daughter's music teacher that she may not want to recommend The Music Store as a rental source.   So disappointing. :-("
2,While at Fiesta Mall with my son who was getting his hair cut we decided to eat. We wondered around the food court and was approached by an employee of Sarku Japan offering free samples of their teriaki chicken. After trying it my son just had to order from there.  The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable.  He ordered the teriaki chicken & shrimp. The amount of food that he got was way more than expected and he was happy it tasted like what it was suppose to. \nA definate place we'll visit in again and highly recommend!!
1,"It's the bare minimum that you would expect from Starbucks. I have never been able ti order a breakfast sandwich because they always run out before 10am. When asked how many sandwiches they usually carry the lady told me only 7! No wonder they always run out. They are only good for making you a drink at a mediocre pace. And don't expect much from these baristas, They have a sense of entitlement to the place that subtly overwhelms the customer service. Handle the stress ladies, its just a coffee shop."
1,"this is actually about the service advisor telephone call I just had..... I bought a new washing machine in January and due to my own fault, I had a load get very unbalanced.  Ever since then, the machine is EXTREMELY noisy in the spin cycle so I called to schedule a service technician to come have a look at my new machine.  \n\nAfter being on hold for 10 minutes, I get some guy going through the scripted stuff and he asks the problem.  I describe it and then he proceeds to tell me how to troubleshoot the dishwasher.  Ok.  Not the dishwasher I'm talking about.\n\nHe then is quiet for a good three or four minutes and comes back to tell me he can't find anything in his manual for the washing machine issue.\n\nYea.  I know.  Please schedule the technician.\n\nHe then wants to talk about other home service warranties I can buy and nope, I just want to schedule the technician.  He needs a zillion other questions answerd and finally, a month from today, I get to have a technician sent to the house.\n\nMore questions, more stuff to try to sell me and really, I hung up because this is already 30 minutes into just trying to set an appointment for somebody to come look at my machine."
0,"Unbelievably bad service.  They made me wait 1.5 hours for my appt and then treated me like I was just another source of revenue.  5 minutes with a PPA and then maybe 10 minutes with the Dr. The Dr looked he was annoyed to treat me. Then some blood work and then come back and see us in three months, with no help in between.  \n\nWhen you call to make or change an appt you have to listen to a 10 min long commercial on what they can do and are placed on hold forever to talk to someone.  I have been trying to change an appt now for over three hours ... waiting on the phone then getting hanged up on.  Call back and wait an hour with no response.   I called their number 18 TIMES! Forget it!  This place SUCKS I am a person and will not be treated this way.  Oh then there is the threat to bill you if you miss an appt. but then there is now way to change an appt.  NOT EVEN an email address from their web page.  WTF?!?  \n\nIts obvious whats going on here, the Dr's are too concerned about making money and not at all concerned about the health of their patients.  That's why there is little to no support staff (to reduce expenses) and long waits because they over booked. That way they can cram in as many people as possible. Good bye forever.\n\nSTAY AWAY ... STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!"
4,"I've been here several times and the food is consistently Amazing! It's hot, fresh and always tasty. Every time I come here I order something different and I've never been disappointed. Great service and take out as well. The price is average or low, for the quality it's unbeatable. I've been to a lot of bad Chinese restaurants, this is not one of those places.  5 stars on food quality and 4 1/2 on service. If you love good food, be sure and give this place a chance!"
4,"It is hard to review a massage location because it all depends on the masseuse. I have gone through 8 different therapists at this location and they were all very good. Each one has a slightly different style, and you have to find what you like and communicate with them. I have finally found a masseuse that suits me perfectly and I will be booking with her from now on! I have been a member of massage envy for 10 months now, my home location is in Gilbert but I Like this one much better. The front desk staff is friendly and helpful and the location is clean and restful. There is nothing ostentatious about massage envy, small rooms with no decor, but that's not what I go there for. The massages are great, relaxing and wonderful stress relievers. This location has not let me down yet!"
1,"This is certainly an organization that prefers to garner your money via trickery and fine print while they could just as well earn it, along with your respect, with their massages.  I had two very good quality massages but paid over $300 for them.  Within days of an arbitrary deadline my \""membership\"" \""expired.  Gone were the two, what I'm sure would have been, very good massages that I thought were coming to me.  While my business sense tells me it would have been smarter to for them to keep a client for the long term, Massage Envy Dobson chose instead to take that short term profit from the technicality.  Given two chances to \""unexpire\"" my membership and maintain this otherwise satisfied customer,  they have lost me for good.  Profiting from those \""membership dues\"" , unclaimed monthly massages, must make better business sense to Massage Envy than simply offering a quality product for a fair price. \nIf you buy into their program, expect to play into their bet that you too will enjoy some very high priced services. Expect no due process nor leniency."
3,Local shop with a great selection and very helpful. \n\nGot to support the locals!
2,"I had to purchase a few map books for work and this is the best location in the east valley. The reason I like this place so much is because they usually carry everything I need for our Arizona and Nevada branches. I have been coming here for years now to purchase updated maps for the valley. Each time I need something, they have it and they have it in bulk, which is greatly appreciated. A lot of people guy online now to order or use GPS so map stores are few and far between. I like being able to have a store that is local so I don't have to wait for shipping. It also nice to go through map books in person to see which works best for what I need it for. The staff is always courteous and helpful whenever I have called or gone down to make a purchase. Thanks for always carrying what we need!"
1,"This is a weird place, but it was very laid back.. and lit up. For a dive, its sure are bright in here.. but thats ok. I had a few $1 drink during happy hour 5-7, and then I had a few moderately priced drinks. \n\nIt was ok, but definitely nothing to write home about. The waitresses was nice enough, and the atmosphere was ok. But there was nothing that ever would draw me back here again.\n\n.. und das... ist das.."
4,MMM MMM MMM Thats what i feel about this place. I mean COME ON this is one of the best Arab Food restaurants i think in the WHOLE USA. I know that might be going a bit over board but of all the restaurants i have been to this is the best. I love the Kabob Combo and gyros from there but the best part of the experience is the customer service. Owner is a really nice man and i think his whole family helps out with the shop. :)
3,"First time having Middle Eastern food, I ordered the veggie platter, which consisted of about 5 different sides. My favorite was the falafel which was crunchy and still warm. The hummus was fresh, along with the Pitas. I also got to try the Asian salad which was really good! For my taste some of the food was a bit too tangy or sour, but other than that it was delicious! The service was good only have two workers not including the cook, so it was a bit slow but they were all nice and courteous. \n\nPs. If you have a sweet tooth the pistachio Baklava was My favorite thing on the menu!"
4,"Stopped in for a drink after a long bike ride.  Total dive bar, but patrons and staff were very friendly.  I didnt have a bike lock and the patrons/owner said i could just bring in the bike while I got smashed.  I must have spent about $20 after being there for 2-3 hours.  I think the beers are $2.  Its a cash only bar, but they have an ATM in the front.  I will definitely be heading there again soon."
4,"Sue and company have run an outstanding restaurant for 23 years in the east valley. Terrific Chinese cuisine, in a very pleasant sit down setting. You will not find better service at any restaurant, anywhere. Not sure what \""pretty standard\"" Chinese food means; but compared to several other east valley Asian fares, including the major chains, this place is superior. \nPlus, if you're going to gamble on taking out Moo Shu, the dish that is typically created and rolled at your table, well, you takes your chances.\n\nIf you like the occasional fried delicacy, try the Golden Gate shrimp; love it!\n\nSpend your precious eat-out dollars at locally owned businesses."
2,It's okay. it's nothing like San Francisco food .
4,"My stylist Traci did a great job! I did a cut style and deep conditioning. She knew a lot about hair and the cut was great. She did exactly what I wanted! The smallest trim possible, I'm trying to grow my hair out and she made it look super healthy, she fixed my bangs, and did some damage control from a few of my previous cuts! Thanks I'll be back :)"
4,"This was my first time eating at this establishment, and normally, when I write a review, I usually wait until my second visit.  But considering the company has been open since 1963, I figured they are doing something right, so I'll write my review now.  Quite honestly, this was the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Phoenix area.  I love the homemade salsa (not to mention, how MUCH you get - they don't use the tiny bowls for salsa like some restaurants do).  Tonight, I had the carne asada chimichanga, and I have to say that it's probably the best chimichanga I have EVER had.  The tortillas are homemade, and it almost looked like the chimi was pan-fried, because it was over-loaded with grease, which is a definite plus.  It comes with guacamole and sour cream, and I think they kind of over did it with it, but that's my personal preference.  I'm not going to ding them for that.  And the Spanish rice tastes just as it should be - almost like mine.  :)  When we arrived, they were in the middle of their happy hour, where your drinks were half-off.  Bonus!  But if you get regular drinks, such as pop, tea, etc., you get a huge glass for it!  Double bonus.  I know, the little things excite me.  I'll definitely becoming back to this restaurant soon.  I think it's better than Serrano's.  The decor is mediocre, at best, but they make up for it in the food."
0,"I've been here 5 minutes, only one hair stylist here doing a trim on a guy's hair, while chatting and watching YouTube videos and consistently stopping. Should maybe take in to consideration that she has a customer waiting."
0,"My husband rented a suit for our wedding.  A couple days before the wedding he went to pick it up and they had the wrong suit.  My husband is 6'2 and they had been shipped a suit for a man who was only 5'10.  Furthermore, their idea of fixing it was giving him a different shirt suit then the one he picked out months ago.  The women was extremely rude to me when I told her that I thought that was unacceptable and replied starkly that \""mistakes happen\"".  I told her that it was her responsibility as an employee to fix the mistake.  After 45 minutes (if you've ever had a wedding then you know there are a zillion other things you could be doing in 45 minutes three days before the wedding) of her being rude and rolling her eyes at me, she finally got her boss to help us.  He gave my husband a new shirt (one that was not a rental) and just asked that my husband return it after the wedding, which he did.  I mean, was that really that hard for them to figure out how to make THEIR mistake right???"
4,"They certainly have everything, from tiaras to bottles of that stuff you use to create real-looking wounds. A little on the pricey side, but excellent stuff overall."
0,"Horrible place.  Went in for my yearly exam and the doc ordered me some trials.  I came back a few wks later when they came in and I put them on and was looking cross eyed.  While I was in there for the appointment, the doc had me try on 3 different sets w/in a matter of 10 mins.  Left there w/ an OK pair but not the right ones.  They said they were going to order the next pair of trials for me as they didn't have them in stock.  Call 2 weeks later to see if they were in as I was told it only takes 7-10 business days, was told I would get a call back, never received one.  Called 2 days later and they said they weren't in yet but it would be w/in the next few days. Call couple of days later, still not in and then tell me there was a mix up on my order so they had to reorder.  I asked for another trial pair as the ones he gave me on my 2nd visit were old now.  I go pick them up and they give me two contacts that are for my right eye!  seriously people, how hard is it? I think I am going to get Lasik after this crap experience w/ them!  I do not recommend them!"
0,"Horrible place. I've been to different sonic locations and this one is by far the worst. First of all, sonic isn't really great in the first place. This place is absolutely horrible\nI've tried it many times and none of them have been great\nThe burgers here are super greasy, the burritos which I really like in other places, the ones here always have really burnt eggs and are also super weirdly greasy. The fries are always gross, and the ice cream is weirdly gritty?? \nSo if you are craving sonic, just go to a different location."
2,"I've never really had a bad experience per se, but I've not exactly been helped a whole bunch either. It's Home Depot. What more can you expect?"
0,"More expensive than most of the sushi places in Mesa. They make the rolls look normal sized by adding extra rice using very little fish. I would not go back, very poor value."
2,"I would give it more stars, but I don't want the bar to get too crowded."
2,"Nielson's is a local favorite. But I am still confused why everyone loves this place SO much. We have a few couples who nearly beg us to go here after a movie or dinner. Usually we'll give in. And it isn't horrible or anything. I ust prefer others better. I think the frozen custard is pricey and the taste is creamy but otherwise boring. \n\nOne bright spot are the sandwiches, called Grinders. Try the Spicy Italian with pepper relish, the Roast Beef w/ Guacamole, and (my favorite) The Finer Things, with turkey, avacados and cream cheese. Probably not the best for my expanding waistline, but a delicious indulgence.\n\nOthers negatives that pulled my rating down a star: since they are popular, the wait can be 10-15 minutes. And with high school kids behind the counter, the service can be poor."
2,"Through all our trips to Arizona, we kept driving by Nielsen's Frozen Custard when we went to and from our hotel to our daughter's home.  Each time, I would say to myself that we had to give it a try.  However, many times we would drive by it when it was closed.  Well...this trip (our final one to visit our daughter who has now moved), we got here!\n\nUpon entering, we were surprised to find that in addition, to frozen custard, they also served meals (burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.).  We were there strictly for the frozen custard.\n\nWe were greeted by a very friendly young lady who worked behind the counter.  She was patient with us as we perused the massive topping menu---so much choice!  In the end, I chose a small cup of vanilla with sprinkles and my husband had a small cup of unadorned chocolate custard.  After ordering, we were given a number to put on our table then the young lady brought out our order quickly.\n\nWe both agreed that the frozen custard had a nice, creamy consistency.  However, we found that it didn't have much flavor.  Neither the vanilla nor the chocolate had a strong enough flavor---and that was disappointing.  We were expecting much better.\n\nYet, we don't regret giving it a try.  Had we not done so, it would have been one of those things that would have nagged at me.  I would have always wondered if we had missed out on something excellent."
3,"Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure."
0,"So my husband and I had a gift cert to go to the movies. We chose to see pacific rim, which was a great movie, you should go see it. However we got to our theater and chose our seats, we were the only ones there as well. We just figured cause it was monday afternoon so thats why is was not so busy. \n\nMy husband noticed a leak due to the rain storm and informed one of the staff. They did nothing. As the start time for the movie approached and passed and no previews started. He got up and went to ask why they didn't start the movie. They told him they moved it to another theater because of the leak. \n\nNot once did anyone come and tell us that information. Very rude. So as we walked to the other side of the theater, one of the employees handed us two free movie passes as a \""we're sorry\"" gesture which was appreciated, but still very rude to not let us know. \n\nAlso both times I used the restroom while I was there I had to deal with nastiness in the toilet. Almost all of the stalls had something gross in them. Clearly their to busy standing around chit chatting than to attend to the restrooms and make sure their clean.\n\nThe rest of the theater was nice but  from now on we will be going to a different theater."
3,"This theater can get a little crowded on weekends when bigger movies open up but otherwise it's never busy. I've been here during the weekdays when it is a ghost town but no matter when I've gone, I have received great service. I personally like the seats and the bathrooms here over other competitors."
1,I'm SO Tossed up about this place... \nWhen I need something for a DIY Project I go here first EVERY time & EVERY time I've left empty handed... Its a DIY Project that includes Arts & Crafts (Like in their name) HOW is it that I leave Empty Handed? \n\nDepending on the time of the year this store isn't too crowded but the customer service is NO WHERE to be found... Will be heading to Joann's & Hobby Lobby from now on. Dear Michaels: I'm TIRED of leaving empty handed!
1,"I'd give this one star for Store Manager Andrew who is rude and even treats his employees with disrespect. Sweet cashier Kathy is the only reason I went for two...oh and the helpful girl on the phone when I called to see if they had my item in stock. Andrew is lucky for these ladies because he by myself, turns customers away."
0,"Would not recommend this place  to anyone seeking good seafood. We started with crab cakes that were sub par. My husband's steak and prawns were weak. The steak was not sirloin quality and the shrimp smelled and tasted badly. The manager was kind enough to knock off about $8 for his meal, but the plate was so bad the entire entree should have been deducted. \nMy snow crab legs were good, but the side veggies were not. They had a strange lemon flavor which doesn't normally accompany green beans and zucchini - which was over cooked. Squishy zucchini is never good. \nOverall our only positives were the side salads. \nThe restaurant itself is also very dark, the lights never seemed to get brighter. Our server was pleasant but very slow. The place was not that busy so we are still not sure what took so long for the food and check to arrive. We won't be returning."
0,"Don't waste your money.  Food was not fresh and there is not much of a selection.  A BOGO coupon got us die hard SWEET TOMATO fans to try Souper Salad again.  Paid $15 for lunch and were not impressed.  First the toddler high chairs were filthy, booster seat caked with food. Got my son settled and found the bathrooms to be dirty and out of paper towels. No spoons by the soup. No forks by the salad. There is no place to retrieve plates by the \""hot bar\"" which had 2 potatoes, old selection of taco items and luke warm pizza. There was two pieces of bread sitting in the pan. The soups were cold and the ranch dressing was warm. Started looking around the restuarant and found that everything needs a good cleaning.  The plastic the sugar comes in was caked with food, so was the salt and pepper shakers.  I started to wonder how clean the prep area in the back was and how fresh the food really was.  Save your money.  Try Sweet Tomatoes instead - they are worth the drive if you are looking for a fresh selection.\nBTW - only two other couple were there - that should have been our first clue."
1,Can you say- alot of food. First time patron and wasn't that impressed. It's alright nothing spectacular. Just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids.
4,"4 words.  rib eye medium rare.\nand cinammon butter rolls.\nhands down, the BEST steakhouse.  better than outback, ruth chris's, all the fancy places."
2,"It was Friday before Christmas and all through the house; not a person was cooking, so we headed on out!\n\nWe were in the mood for some ribs and fix'ins, and only Texas ribs would do.  If you've been to Tex-ass, you know what I mean. One of those full racks of ribs, or pull pork meals.  Gooo-dd!  \n\nShort of twelve hours on US Highway 10, we decided to go to Mesa instead. Our choices was Logan's Roadhouse, Famous Dave's or Texas Roadhouse; we decided to come here since it's been awhile. \n\nWhat can I say, some things never change and TR is real good at filing a craving. As I said in my tip, the wait time on a Friday night before Christmas was short, only seventeen minutes. They have nice little setup where one of their two managers has a headset connected with the bus'ers. So, as one customer leaves, the table is cleared in seconds. My guess is fifteen seconds, tops!  Beauty in action. \n\nThe three of us ordered: the Pulled Pork Dinner for $9.49; the Chicken Tenders dinner with biscuit gravy for $9.99; the Full Slab of Ribs for $17.49 and a whole bunch of sides that came with the dinner. The only extra is what I call the cardiac arrest, Loaded Steak Fries.  It was topped with cheese and bacon, a $0.99 up charge.   Lemonade and pop ran us $2.39 each. \n\nThe music was loud, the food was okay and it hit the spot.  One of the fun things about Texas Roadhouse is how the wait staff does some line dancing every 30/45 minutes, or so.  It's fun to watch, but none of the customers near the bar joined in. \n\nOur server Megan and the rest of the staff kept all our drinks filled and tag-teamed our table with biscuits and services. We thought the bill for three of $45.63, was about right before tip and taxes. \n\nWe do not get down this way much, but we'll be back."
4,"The bottomless bread and cinnamon butter alone are worth the trip.\n\nI've seen others complaining about the wait, or the order in which parties are seated.  What they fail to realize is that Texas RH offers Call Ahead seating.  They'll put you on the list, and give you a window of time in which to show up, so your wait can be done comfortably at home (which is why later parties seem to be seated first).   Any halfway decent restaurant is going to have a wait, at least this one gives you a convenient way to work  around it.  Short of turning business away for your personal wait-time convenience, that's really all they can do.  \n\nI've been here countless times, and the food is consistently amazing.  Rolls are hot and buttery, meals are made fresh to order.  All of the steaks are wonderful, tender, and juicy, but I'd also highly recommend the pulled pork.  \n\nThe staff is great.  They keep our drinks full, and check in like clockwork.  Because it's so busy, servers usually stick to the priorities (seating, food, refill checks), but they always make time to ensure our food is cooked right after bringing it to us.  They're polite, but they don't have a lot of time to linger and chit-chat (For me, that's actually a plus).\n\nThe one downside is that Texas RH is always packed, and usually pretty loud.  If you're looking for a quiet dinner, with a lot of personal one on one time with your server, this probably isn't the place for you.  But if you want consistently great food, speedy service, and a fun atmosphere, you can't go wrong."
1,"This first paragraph is a 1 to 2 starness......\nWell for starters they had empty trays, and the empty trays were the hottest ones that is there was steam coming off of them. In other words most of the food was cold. This place must've been severely understaffed because they didn't get the plates off our table till long after we'd gotten another. They were letting the food trays run empty for 10 and 15 minutes at a time.\n\nThis second paragraph is the 3 to 4 starness......\nthe food may have been cold but some of it was very good, in that the spicing was done correctly. Often Chinese buffets spicy dishes are not quite as spicy as they need to be in my book to be called spicy. The price was good and the drink was included but that's not enough to make up for all the inequities. It was pretty much unanimous at the time we left our little UYE Rand H. Mike C. Robyn N and myself all agreed and said in the parking lot as we left two stars. Rand H. upon further contemplation came to one star. And only because some of the food was fairly good did I stay at two stars. I hope they get it right, but I won't be going back there anytime soon."

Ok, since you insist, there is a trader joes, a fry's and a Walmart nearby.\nPick one of those places and buy yourself some bagels. \nJust don't come here, they don't deserve you.\n\nThe service will be horrible. They will take a long time to take your order, even longer to make your food, and you will stand there waiting for your food wondering how there can be 6 employees behind the line with no other orders ahead of you and it's been 15 minutes and you still have no food.\n\nOnce you finally receive your food, you will leave ASAP because you can't stand the incompetence and also you want to eat in a place that does not look like a high school cafeteria after a food fight.\n\nWhen you get home, your order will be wrong. You have been warned."
1,"Never go on a busy morning!  We went on a Saturday at 9:30 am and they were out of a lot of bagels, all 4 coffee dispensers were empty and it took 15 minutes to get our food to go... after ordering!  It was a cluster! They gave our food to someone else and it took 5 minutes for the lady to make an iced coffee.. from the menu, not customized.  \n\nThe food was fine, but this quick service restaurant was in the weeds and super slow."
0,"I had been going to them for years, but stopped a few years back feeling they lacked the attention to detail they once had. This feeling was confirmed recently when issues started presenting themselves. I've discovered incorrect parts (wrong size fuel filter, etc.) were installed...and the freeze plug they left in my engine! A few years back I had them replace some freeze plugs that were leaking. Well, they didn't tell me one popped into my engine and they did not try to retrieve it! A month ago the plug worked its way into my pump. Engine smoked, seized, and shredded my s-belt. Luckily it happened on a side street where I could immediately pull over, turn off the car, and have AAA tow to their shop. AAA discovered the issue, pulled the mangled plug out of my pump. Repair job costing me a few hundred dollars. I say lucky, because it could have been far worse, like the car is on the highway moving to another state and/or I completely lose the engine. I would be leery of their work. Especially with a safety concern. The attention to detail they once had, is and has been gone for some time now. Your better off doing the work yourself or taking it to AAA. The local AAA shop on E. Valley Auto Drive has been great these past few years, saved my car, talk the issue out with me, show me the parts they removed, etc.. They are worth every penny!"
1,"Got together with Mike C. to go out to a Thanksgiving Buffet today.  We tried for Golden Corral down the street in Gilbert but the line was way outside, so we came up here where there was also a wait, but shorter.  It was good, as always, but there were some negatives this time:\n\n*  The soups:  There was an ordinary Corn Chowder, a weak Cream of Broccoli, & ordinary Chicken Noodle.  They should have done better than this for Thanksgiving.\n\n*  There was no cottage cheese.  (They don't always have it, but at these prices they should have some today.)\n\n*  There was turkey, but breast meat only & no dressing!\n\n*  Over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudge (& it looked not as if it had run out, but rather that they just didn't offer any today).\n\n*  There were no sundae cups.  I had to go over & get a soup bowl to make a sundae.\n\n*  There was Hot Lava Cake (or \""Hot Fudge Cake\"" I think they call it here), but it was sorely lacking in lava!\n\nThus, it's down to 2 Stars for this restaurant that wasn't as good as it should have been for the money.\n\nThanksgiving Buffet $12.99/$12.49 Sr."
3,"My fiance, his friend and I went to Stratum for my fiance's birthday. The Thursday Thunder deal (unlimited games for $15 from 4:30 - 9) was a grreat deal! I was very pleased with the service from the staff and admired their patience levels with the screaming 10 year olds around them. \n\nWith that said, I would also like to say that we did have problems with the equipment (only when we played red team for some reason) and in large room like that it is impossible to control that many people (about 40 players). I had more trouble with teens and tweens breaking the rules than I did with anything else there. I do not blame the staff, of course, because there is only so much one or two people can do against 40. \n\nI did not get anything from the snack bar so I cannot rate that. I did however play around in their arcade and it is lackluster at best. Very limited and cramped. The flow is very difficult to get through when there are 50+ kids and parents running around. \n\nUp until the end (when a bus of about 60+) showed up for a party we had a blast."
0,"Honestly, don't waste your money and go to Laser Quest. If you have the unfortunate timing to have issues with the workings of the business while Vinny is in charge, nothing will get solved. Vinny is one of the owner's relatives and treats you exactly like one would expect - terribly because he can get away with it. He will smirk at you like a sleezy used car salesman, if it wasn't already obvious that since he already has your money, there's nothing he's willing to do for you. \n\nThey allow too many people into each game (up to 60) so if you have problems with your pack, which has likely a 25% chance of failure, you are forced into a cycle of being shot and not able to play since everyone else got a 30 second start. \n\nAlso, if they're having a special that you call to confirm, be advised that the employees may not give you all of the information needed to get the special, such as the need to physically print coupons, and, of course, Vinny will do nothing to remedy the situation. \n\nTL; DR: Save your time, money, and frustration and go to Laser Quest, where you also get to make up silly player names."
3,"Yoko is pretty good, prices are just right and service is friendly and prompt. I would recommend this to someone."
1,"I read the other Yelp reviews while I was sitting in this restaruant.  Too late. \n\nHere's the deal - the other reviews are spot-on about the service.  Friendly, happy, and attentive.  \n\nThe food though, is NOT so fantastic.  I ordered a Belgian Waffle and my hubbie ordered French Toast.  Both tasted deep fried, which is totally weird.  The butter was in little sealed Shamrock Farms tabs on the table, and was not kept cold, which I found extremely odd.  I mean, overall, the food was okay, but I woudn't recommend it to a friend, so I don't recommend it to you.  Everything came out ordered the way we ordered it, but it just wasn't that great.\n\nThe restaurant was clean, but our waitress had animal hair on her black t-shirt, which unnerved me more than a little."
1,"Went for my second time this weekend, but not because the first time was good and I wanted to go back - someone else chose. \n\nThe first time I had the ramen and it wasn't very good. I remember having left sort of let down and still hungry because I didn't want to finish what I ordered. This time I went with sushi. I got the dragon roll, spicy tuna and eel w/avocado. I'm no sushi expert, but I wasn't terribly impressed. The dragon roll was the best of the three, mostly because it was large and fried. It was all just alright. I've had better."
3,"I have been coming here for over 10 yrs.  I try other places and always come back to Nancy's place.  They are friendly, I like my nails and pedi's."
0,This seemingly is JUST for the home--not for people's clothes. I thought it was a JoAnn's competitor.\n\nBolts and bolts of fabric on hanging rolls. Also carpets. No one said hello or offered to help us. No patterns here. They have designer fabric but i didnt check the labels.
1,"Went there for lunch today. This is my second time visiting and the second time my order was messed up. I had ordered a chicken ceaser salad burrito. It was my mistake I guess, from what I remember a ceaser salad doesn't have tomatoes in it. Well it does here. I don't like tomatoes. Love ketchup but not regular tomatoes soggin up my meal. I had them make another burrito. The menu clearly states what's in a ceaser salad, and tomato is not one of the ingredients. The replacement burrito tastes slightly better than the first but not by much. Maybe they had a surplus of tomatoes and were trying to get rid of em I don't know. Should've went to Costa Vida but as we all know they are almost always crowded. Ugh F me and my burrito cravings."
0,"First off I love Baja Fresh but not after this last experience...  I went to Baja Fresh with my family (wife and  two year old daughter) they had to use the ladies room so they waited 7 minutes for someone to come come out so they could use it.  The person in the bath room was a hispanic Baja Fresh worker.  He told us he was cleaning but we could go in after after was done.  He then left and we went in\"" it was disgusting.  Nothing was cleaned and we knew he was in their on his cell phone pretending to clean.  Then I went in the mens bathroom  and the bathroom floor was completely covered in urine.  The guy who was cleaning the bathroom also went stright from the bath room to cooking on the grill without ever washing his hands.  We were completely grossed out.  I got my girls back in the car and went in to talk to the manager.  The cook we had the run in with heard that I was waiting to talk to the manager and tried to maddog(stair me down) from behind the counter.  I told the manager what had happened and how disgusted we were.  I told the manager who also looked like he was probably intemidated by the workers himself.  Never eating there again after this...GROSS!!!!!"
4,"i love tjs there selection of vegies,cheeses,flowers,ect ,ect, ect all at such great prices, and just there over all selection of intresting products, i  am like a kid in a candy store,"
2,"Let me start out by saying that I'm not a Trader Joe's fan, but after a recent debate about grocery stores where a friend really stood her ground about it having such great prices, I figured I would suck it up and give this location a try. It's located in a strip mall (surprise!!) with the worst parking lot ever, so I didn't really know what to expect. My only other TJ experiences have been in Center City Philadelphia (gross) and a stand-alone in a suburban Seattle neighborhood.\n\nThis store is really clean. I went on a Sunday afternoon so it was fairly crowded, but the shelves were stocked and it was pretty easy to maneuver around. If I had a cart it might be another story but I grabbed a basket and went up and down each aisle a couple times. The only messy area was the bathroom but I probably just caught it in between cleaning shifts. \n\nNot knowing what I was looking for, I picked up a couple items for dinner and snacks for the kids. Yogurt tubes - good price. English muffins - good price and probably the best I have ever had. Orange Chicken (frozen) - could have been spicier but the kids loved it. Meat dept - expensive...better prices at Sprouts. Frozen blueberries - cheapest around. All-in-all it was a good experience, I was pleasantly surprised, and I started drafting my \""okay, you win\"" text to my friend who stood her ground and I headed to the register.\n\nI stood in line and when I was my turn, I told my cashier that I had a bag. This is where they get docked 2 stars. For the amount of time it takes to ring up the 7 items that I had, my cashier made not one, not two, but five smart-ass comments about the fact that I had a Whole Foods bag. I know, I know, what a dumb thing to get bent over, but for me it has to do with service, and Roger (cashier), should just bite his tongue, keep his opinions to himself, and just be happy that I am contributing to his ability to receive a paycheck. I know the $22 I spent is just a teeny-tiny percentage of what the store brings in on a normal day, but because of that interaction, I won't go out of my way to shop there, even if it means saving a couple bucks."
1,"This TJ's needs to replace the lady who was serving the strawberry short bread dessert on 5/24.   This TJ's has always had exceptional staff members that are friendly and very helpful which is why we drive over 10+ miles every other week for our TJ's purchases.\n\nSo if you are serving a dessert with organic strawberries, whipped cream and short bread to anyone and a 13 year kid comes up ....... and TJ's has an issue with allergies etc. just say, \""Sorry, we need a parent\"", instead of smacking a kids hand away from the sample and then saying \""if you fall from allergies, I am not going to help you\"".  \n\nThe staff here always been so helpful, fun and friendly so why would you put a person like that at a sampling station who would say something so unnecessary.    I think she needs to take a refresher course at TJ's Customer Service 101.\n\nThanks For Listening........"
1,"Party of 10.   Made a reservation.    Had to wait 30 minutes anyway.   Desmond, our waiter could have cared less.   Food was decent, but the service was brutal.\n\nIm guessing they either have high staff turnover or are under staffed."
0,"I also wish I could give this dump a negative 5 stars. After seeing the ads on TV, my wife wanted to go there for her birthday dinner. First clue, very slow service. Second, we ordered same drink, an Italian Mojito. My wife's had a bright reddish color of something in the bottom, mine colorless. Point being, they should at least look the same. Server said he'd take care of it, which he did 15-20 minutes later. Apps weren't bad. Meatballs in a way hot sauce and something that looked worse than it tasted. Entrees were at best terrible. My chicken parm was flattened out to where it took up most of the plate. It was burned on the bottom, with very little cheese or sauce on it. My side of spaghetti was cold. Not just not hot or warm, cold. My wife ordered some shrimp pasta dish, not Alfredo. She told me shrimp was tough and had me try it. It was like eating wet cardboard. She didn't eat anymore of the shrimp but said the pasta thing tasted ok. She flagged down a manager and told her about the shrimp, and told her to go in the kitchen and try it. The manager said, No, I believe you and took it off the check. Our server came and just kept saying, Wow, I'm sorry, Wow, Hmmm, Sorry bout that, Wow, Hmmm, Wow, Sorry, Sorry Guys..Hmmmm. Anyway, I agree this place has seen better days and just needs to fade away. There was a total of 6 tables with other diners. Good concept but failing. Needless to say we will never go there again and for sure will tell all about our experience."
2,"Wow, lots of hate on here about this place. Gave me second thoughts about coming here, but we had coupons. Service was very good.  Food was reasonably good, but that's kind of what you expect from a chain. I had the chicken under a brick, and it was just fine.  I didn't care for what my Mom got (chicken scallopini, I think), but she likes that. My wife had the eggplant Parmesan and enjoyed it as well."
0,"Went here as a choice of the in-laws. Hadn't been to a Macaroni Grill in a few years, and was actually looking forward to it as my past experiences (although never at this location) were very good. When we were seated they tried to put us in the first table just outside of the main path back to the kitchen, even though the place was practically empty (it was a Tues evening). When we asked to move out of the main traffic area, they offered a table one spot away from the original one. OK, we'll play your silly game, let's not address the 800 lb gorilla in the room (the 85% empty restaurant). Once seated our server stopped by very quickly to get drink orders and apps.  Before the app came out, our server was back to take our dinner order (so far, so good, right? Ahhhh, just wait). We ordered: Lasagna w/side salad, Capellini with meat sauce, Eggplant Parmesan  with a side of sausage, and a Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad.  The side salad came out not long after the app, and then the wait began. Not sure how long, but it was long enough for the entire table to get antsy and for us to ask for more bread. We even joked that it was because someone ordered lasagna.  When the main courses came out, take a guess which one didn't come out with them...you ready? The Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad. Seriously. The rest of the table started eating (it can't be that far behind, right?) and no kidding, they were at least halfway through their main course when they brought out a salad with what looked like a half of a chicken tender chopped up in it. I thought maybe they had tossed it in or something, and when I confirmed the few small pieces were all that was there, it went from not so good to bad (and soon to really bad...wait for it...).\n\nSo, here I sat with this sad salad with a couple pieces of chicken, and because the wait had been so long, I was done. I told the server I didn't want it anymore and to send it back. Then I told her to make sure her manager saw what was coming out of the kitchen. I saw her talk to the manager and she came back and said they were going to make some more chicken. I told her that I didn't want it at all. I saw her go talk to the manager, who was at this point standing in front of the girl making salads) and I know by her body language and his that she told him I didn't want it at all. A few minutes later I saw them put more chicken on the salad, put some more dressing on it, and he started walking over. When he got to the table I was PISSED (yeah, really). I asked him what part of \""I don't want it\"" did he not understand and he just stood there hovering over me with this damn salad in his hands. I explained everything that had happened and he told me that the server never told him that I didn't want it at all. He asked if there was anything he could do and I said \""Yes, you can go away\"" (he was still just standing there staring at me like he could use the Force to make me take the salad.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, \""Damn, little harsh Bro!\"" Ah yeah, but wait til you hear what sent me over the top...\n\nWhen our server came back (who was very nice and apologetic this entire time) I asked her if she told him that I didn't want the salad at all, no matter how much chicken they put on it, she said (and I fully believe her) \""Yes, I told him that\"". So I told her how he lied to me and threw her under the bus. THAT is just inexcusable. Forget to put an order in, fine. Something not cooked right, oopps.  Throw one of your workers under the bus? Piss poor.\n\nOh yeah, and the app we ordered was zucchini hold the cheese, and it came with cheese, and the side of sausage never came out.\n\nWould I ever go there again? Not a chance. At this point I don't know when I'll even risk going to another Macaroni Grill."
2,"The prices and care delivered at this Spay & Neuter clinic are acceptable. However, I didn't like how the vet tried to sell me on services I clearly didn't need. For example, she tried to convince me to have my dog's nails clipped when I had just clipped them 2 days ago myself. I far prefer the Spay & Neuter clinic in Tempe. Everything that's good about this clinic is good over there, but they're more professional. I gave the clinic in Tempe 5 stars."
1,"Had the BBQ Burger for lunch. Too much lettuce tomato and 'fixings' to steal the taste of the burger away. \n\nLet the meat be the star of the burgers, not lettuce."
0,"This will be quick . Was there the night of May 13. Staff were less than helpful, in fact they weren't helpful at all."
1,"Salesman was persistent on trying to update my $19 wash to a $99 detail. He was borderline argumentative and aggressive, I would not recommend this place at all. The entire establishment is ran by shady looking people, it's not a good sign when you look at other customers and they all look nervous. The lady waiting next me mentioned how she would just be happy if all her belongings are still in the car when they were done. :("
4,"This place is great! I've been to a few different nail places, but always end up coming back here. The people are friendly, the place is clean & relaxing & they do the best job ever! I'm a little picky when it comes to the way my nails look & they have always done them perfectly! I've gotten fake nails put on, and taken off as well as gel manicures and pedicures. They're superb & even though I now live 20 minutes away, I'll keep driving back. I've been going here for 10 years & I have no plans on changing any time soon!"
4,"For starters the atmosphere of Charlestons may be my favorite of any restaurant. Its very dark and relaxing, but there is just enough light at the table to read the menu and eat your food. everything from the brick walls to the tables and chairs are made from dark wood, dark brick, dark leather, and even the wait staff wear all black with no logos, so its almost as if they aren't there and just blend into the background, which I'm sure is an intentional and smart idea. The menu is small, but i have had various items on it from the steak sandwich, The Ribs, Chicken Fried Steak and the Burger and they are all worthy of the 5 star.  the sides are also delicious. its a bit pricey but you get plenty of high quality food for your dollar. If you want a nice, quiet, relaxing and delicious meal, i highly suggest Charleston's."
4,"Good food, arrives hot, service is spectacular!"
3,"The food is absolutely five stars. However they have raised the price and taken away the salad, you now pay an extra $3 for a salad with the prime rib. Rarely do you find a place where a salad doesn't come with a steak and it makes it really expensive. The food however is always excellent. Prime rib, garlic mashed potatoes, creamy garlic dressing, croissants, and spinach dip are all amazing, some of the best ever! Service is always superb and your drinks are always full."
2,"This is a rough looking little strip mall place. The kind of place you see all over the Valley. If you want atmosphere look elsewhere. \n\nWe tried a few different things--tacos, torta and assorted other things. The food was all pretty good--not the best in the world, but good. Tacos are a $1 each. \n\nPrices were awesome and the service was pretty good also. There's not too much else to say about it."
4,Carne Asada tacos are to die for. Had four at $1.10/each and was pleasantly full to the gills. Will return next time in the area.
4,Pretty little dive for some amazing mexican food. The street tacos are amazing and everything along with it was superb. Probably one of the top 5 spots for Mexican food in the east valley.
0,"I was so excited to go here after reading all the reviews, but afterwards wondered if I really had the right place or if it was an off day last Sunday. My experience was very different. We went for a late breakfast. It's best if I summarize my plate. The eggs that I ordered over hard had broken and it was hard to even see the yolks, mixed in as they were. The hamburger patty was the driest, least appetizing I've ever had and even the pancakes were heavy, flat without any taste or salt. I thought it would be hard to mess up these basics but you learn something new every day. The service was nothing exceptional.  I thought the place would have some charm, but there was nothing - just an ordinary diner. It's actually kind of sad when you enjoy the toast with jam more than anything else. Never again. It may be cheap but IMO it's misplaced economics to pay anything for something so disappointing."
3,"I just had the pleasure of eating here today.  The burger and fries were tasty and the chocolate and strawberry shakes were great.  The two guys working there were super polite and very thankful to us for coming by for lunch.  They personally walked each patron to the door as they left thanking them each along the way.  That's what I look for in a restaurant, friendly staff and good food, they have both."
2,"I came here with high hopes after reading the many good reviews.  what I found was good local hole in the wall that is somewhat over rated.\nmy burger was very dry - as the cook pressed down on the patties I kept screaming in my head PLEASE STOP!\nThe fries were very meh.  They were crunchy but had no character.\nThe best thing was that the ingredients were fresh.  While the patties were preformed they were not frozen.  They used plent of bacon so there was a piece in every bite.  The lettuce was green and crisp and overall it was a decent lunch, but over priced for what I got.  I probably won't make another trip back but if I lived nearby I would return rather than hit a fast food burger."
4,I'm still full of this delicious old school edible greatness! An amazing staff with just enough snark to make it worth your while. Delicious burgers and shakes...the breakfast looks great as well (we ARE GOING BACK). Oh yea one more thing- APPLE PIE.
3,"The valley isn't known for its \""mom and pop restaurants\"" or \""Dives\"" as I affectionately call them but this place was spot on a great place to eat. I'm looking forward to trying their breakfast items."
0,I have 4 cars I've been taking to Brake Masters for years. I have had to keep my eye on them with the pricing and the quality of service. You'd think they would value my business with the thousands of work every year I send them. Well I took my truck in for an alignment and the quoted me $3000 for some work I did in my driveway for $600 including paying a helper. They wanted $610 for an upper control arm assemble that cost me $100 at Autozone. I'm never going there again and I will make it a point to call them out in person.
4,"Still the best dinner theater .Great for all ages .Very clean ,and nice ."
0,Love the organ...  Sad to see this Arizona historical treasure in such danger of mediocrity due to poor management.  The pizza we had wasn't worth taking home.  I didn't want to insult the cardboard box by putting pizza in it that is more tasteless than  itself.  Fix yer food folks!!!
1,I was in the area so I tried out royal cleaners. A bit pricey I think.....the 2 out of 3 pairs of shorts I had them repair (buttons) have came off again. Being that they weren't cheap I expected a much better job
0,"Upon walking into the office I was a bit perplexed. I thought I was entering a free clinic. I'm still not sure. My appointment was for 1pm. I wasn't seen until 1:50pm. Had I been that late they would have cancelled my appointment. Nonetheless I saw Bryan Monson, at least I think it was Bryan Monson, perhaps it was (Silver Surfer: Can enter Hyperspace. tied Nova He can enter Hyperspace as well. tied Green Lantern)the whole appointment lasted 1 minute 35 seconds. He referred me to  Dr. Garcia in the office for surgery. Explained it for about 15 seconds to my daughter. I guess I'm too old to understand and was out like a shot. Yeah, errr won't be going back. No thanks for the Botox."
2,"I like Dr. Garcia and her assistant, I am not at all impressed with the billing office staff that work out of corporate! I've been trying to pay my bill for 3 months now (yes, pay it!) and cannot get anyone to call me back!!! Highly disorganized team....again, no concerns or issues with my doctor, she is great - its the administrative team that simply do not have it together!"
0,"At first the experience was good. The rep at this company was very friendly and seemed to listen to our needs. After talking to them specifically about the type of dog we have (a Pitbull) and that many management companies don't accept them, we were assured that was not an issue with the property we were looking at. Even their own website said on that property listing (and others) there were no breed restrictions. However after turning in our non refundable app fee, they stated that due to the breed of our dog we were not able to obtain the house...They refused to refund the app fee (due to it not being refundable) even though they were in the wrong here...they told us before we applied that the dog was no issue..Also not only did they refuse to refund the app fee they didn't even offer to use the files or app fee we paid towards another property application. The manager there tried to tell my roommate that he sits next to his rep and he knows he never said anything like this...ya we wouldn't just make this up also the manager leaves by 5 i think if i remember correctly. Most of the calls we had with the rep were after 6pm. Be very cautious in using this company. I personally don't recommend them due to my experience with them."
0,I sued these people and won. Please make sure you take pictures when you move in and when you move out! Office is full of kids that have no idea what they are doing. Check out their reputation with the BBB.
0,"Used this property management company to oversee our rental properties.  Bad experience.  They are great at collecting money and making sure they collect their fees but do not believe in doing any work for those fees.  Very poor at follow thru, do not care about the tenant or the owner, only about collecting fees.  Very unprofessional in how they deal with people.  Sales pitch is just that, lie to get your business but do not expect follow through.  Do yourself a favor, as a tenant or owner, and find another company."
0,"I had George bend me up a couple pipes for my custom exhaust, and when I ran into a snag and took the vehicle to him about getting another pipe fabricated he was a complete jerk. I don't own a hydraulic bender or a lift, that's the only reason I was there. What I was asking for would have taken less then an hour to do with those tools. He spoke down to me the entire time constantly telling me that my vehicle was \""a mess\"" and that I was doing \""everything wrong\"" and that he refused to work on my vehicle unless he got to completely tear everything out and redo it, which I couldn't afford. I'm a machinist and welder that has grown up around cars and apprenticed in numerous hot rod shops. I might know a thing or two, and the first thing I know is I would NEVER treat my customers that way. I would avoid this place at all costs."
0,"High price, takes two or more trips and would not recommend. Looking at other review sites, This is not the company I  want. They advertise a lot, but that does not mean much to me. Quality performance is available from local business at almost half the price with one day service. See my other reviews. Sorry moved on and would not use again."
3,"Buffalo wings are on of my main food groups. One of the reasons I miss living in Arizona, that's right not somewhere in the N East that get's cold, but AZ. Wing are perfect each time, right amount of spice, heat and sauce. Being spoiled by NNY has ruined me for life. I can't seem to find a close second to this, and man have I tried. Love the other food btw, and the service has always been good everytime I go. NNY is my excuse to visit my relatives in AZ."

0,"I really hope Native Newyorkers CORPORATE is paying attention to these reviews. Most people here are complaining about the same things over and over and with my recent visit I can assure you none of those problems have been fixed.\n\nHere's my experience from my recent visit on the Mayweather's fight past week.\n\n- When we walked in, after telling the host how many, he just handed the menu to us and told us to sit wherever instead of walking us to a table. This is the worst you can do to a customer. Hand them a menu and tell them to go sit down. Are you too lazy to walk them to a table?\n\n- Place was disgusting. Beer all over the floor and sticky seats and tables. \n\n- Like most people complained here, this facility seems like a depressing hotel from the 90's. No ambience, not hip at all. Also has a weird smell.\n\n- WINGS = EXTRA SMALL compare to any other NN location. \n\n- Rude waiters, specially the guys that work here. No smile, Not friendly. \n\n- Our chicken strips came out burnt. Returned the order. No manager came out to talk to us. \n\nAll in all this NN has worst service than a moms and pops Pete's fish. Not worth it."
1,"Ohkay, So I was working 3rd shift this day, Went throu the drive throu got a Carmel Machiatto. These people, over flilled the coffe to where when they handed it to me, and i put the straw in it over flowed onto my work scrubs! not to mention the coffee was burnt!!\n\nI mean yeah more for your money but not when its all over you and you hav burnt coffee..... SO.... Taste before you drive off!! Not to mention, when I went back to get \""Fresh\"" coffee, they were totaly rude about it!"
0,"Verizon stores and their system of herding their customers must have been designed by some Machiavellian-type person who watches from afar, with hidden cameras placed in all locations, and watches what transpires inside the stores like some sort of \""Big Brother\"" experiment in human behavior.\n\nWhen I walk into a Verizon Wireless store because my unfortunately-named Verizon Glyde (all I can think of is a personal lubricant, how about you? maybe I have a dirty mind...) with a touch screen no longer wants to be touched... the \""greeter\"" scowls at me, tells me it's gonna be at least an hour and a half, and then adds my name to the bottom of the queue.  \n\nI instantly notice that it smells of excrement... and that, quite literally, the store is crawling with humans.  It's like a bus station.  There are sad-looking people on benches, huddled together for moral support, crying in the corner, and laying in a puddle on the floor.  I relegated myself to sit by a wobbly-looking display with outdated products, hoping I'd be left alone to wait out my sentence.\n\nI have rarely seen the likes of the despair that I saw in my two hours of waiting in the Verizon store.  I bore witness to two different women using Verizon phones, calling customer service in tears, bawling about how the reps at the store refused to help them. I should have taken this as a sign. I watched a person pick off a really large scab. I saw a really together-looking dude get to the point of a breakdown when a rep jumped another customer in front of him in the queue. I mean, there was almost a brawl. I saw three crickets, a spider and a roach... and this was all before my name was called.\n\nThe service rep could not, no, WOULD not, fix my phone.  He took one look at the Glyde and started to laugh. \""THIS is the worst phone Verizon ever produced.  I can't fix this thing.  I won't even be trying.  Sorry, girl.  You need to get yourself another phone.\""  Rep then proceeded to detail my options. A. Buy brand-new expensive phone. B. Buy pre-owned expensive phone. C. Be phoneless.  \""Surely you must have a clunky Zack Morris-style phone to donate to a damsel in distress!\"" I protested.  No dice.  \""Not even a loaner until my next paycheck?\"" Not a snowball's chance in hell.  \n\nIt's ever so obvious that I was never going to get my phone fixed, and no matter what was wrong with it, I was going to be told that I had no choice but to purchase an entire new phone.  I think it's more than a little messed-up to not offer your customers solutions and options instead of backing them into corners. I'm between paychecks, and couldn't justify paying the evil overlords of Verizon hundreds of dollars for another POS, so I am now incommunicado, and am totally bummed."
1,"Yet another corporate restaurant that loves to play musical chairs with their menu.  Seems month to month you don't know what they'll remove and what new thing they'll add.  Think about it, a class A restaurant that actually does make a good burger doesn't need to play hide and seek with their menu items . . . ever!\n\nIf I were to rate Red Robin burgers over other burgers I've had in my life, I'd give them around a 5/10.  They are simply sub-par and lack any real good burger flavor.  I did enjoy a pot roast burger they used to make, but good old corporate idiots took it off the menu.\n\nThe main thing with any Red Robin is it's all about atmosphere and friendly service, which they do rate a 10 in that department.  Unfortunately, the food is nothing to write home about.  There's literally nothing on their menu that I would find so good it's addictive, and isn't really, really good food what a restaurant should be about?  It's kind of sad, really.  They do have all the right flair and decent service, but the food is so corporate average that it makes the rest of the experience dull."
0,"Went to red robin on April 26, 2014 at 5:20 pm. We were ignored for 20 minutes before finally being offered something to drink. Food was great. We had the grilled chicken sandwich,  pizza, and a burger.  Took 20 minutes to get more fries. Waitress constantly ignored our table. Great food. Poor service.  Wouldn't recommend this place during peak times if you want decent service. I may go back on a tuesday or another less busy time."
1,The prices are great but the wait is CRAZY just for picking up birth control that I called in on Monday it has taken me more than an hour. I finally got called but they can't find my pills I ordered four days ago.. Now I'm still waiting and I'll be surprised if they actually do anything for me. I should have known.. The first time I came here for my initial visit it took two hours with an appointment.. That's only 30 minutes of actually being in the back getting checked up and an hour and a half of wIt time! :( the only person that could finally help me was Adrianna! Thank you!

0,"I was there this weekend, both Saturday and Sunday for a Youth Tournament for my son. Our \""home bowling alley\"" is the Brunswick Zone on Southern and Dobson. This was my first time to this particular alley. This was the worst bowling alley I have ever been to in my entire 31 years of living. \n\nThe location is hidden back behind some office buildings. The building is plain, late 60's decor. The interior, from what I was told, had not been updated in over a decade at least. The newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls. (for neon bowling I presume) \n\nThere is no real seating for the bowlers. There are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building. Each table only gets 4 chairs, so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers, someone is going to have to stand.  On a rack, in the corner, in the back, there are about 20 alley owned balls, so good luck getting one in the right weight. The bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.  Whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile. The handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up. It stays wide open, so you can't even get in there. The flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush, so you might want to flush with your foot. \n\nThere are only about 20 lanes, and they are occupied by what seems like permanent residents, over the age of 80. They didn't even want to leave for the alley-sponsored tournament. \n\nThe food was just thrown together. Nachos were a plate full of chips, and a tiny cup of cheese sauce. 2 small sodas ran me over $6. The overpriced snack bar didn't even accept credit/atm cards because their phone line was down. \n\nThe lanes were so slick and greasy, they practically had puddles of oil in them. Lane 4 occasionally goes completely dark while people are bowling. \n\nThey do NOT have a pro shop. Their arcade games were few, and broken. I don't think they serve alcohol.I did not see a bar.\n\nI would never, ever come to this bowling alley again by choice. Even the AMF on Main that closed last year was better than this one. They should have closed this one instead. If you're looking for a place to bowl, I would suggest you go anywhere but here."
1,"If they could only figure out how to take phone orders without putting people on hold for 6, 7, or 8 minutes or more, they'd be doing well. This Domino's is very close to my house and when I get a craving for their new, rather yummy, thin crust pizza, it's just easier for me to drive up there and order.  But then I'm relegated to sitting in the very drab waiting room.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend this location too much after sunset. They've had some issues in the parking lot (shootings and the like)."
0,"I had a contract with this company for their \""All Pest Solution\"". I continuously had Drywood Termites that they couldn't seem to treat properly. Not only does their warrentee not cover damage done by the termites such as other companies like Terminex, but they wouldn't even cover the price of the tenting to get rid of the termites. After I paid them over $1000 for tenting, they voided my warrantee giving no reason. Now I'm out that money and have to pay another company over $1000 to get a new warrantee.\n\nStay away!!! These folks don't play by the book."
1,"I believe that Streets of New York is a chain, and I've certainly enjoyed my experience at other locations, but this one in particular was a bit of a disaster. The food was all right, but the service was slow and unfriendly. The waiters were borderline anti-social and another guy who seemed to be the owner or at least the manager wasn't much better. \n\nIf you're yearning for Streets of New York Pizza, try another location."
0,"I am absolutely disgusted by the level of customer service at Sprint Store 6736 E Baseline Rd #104, Mesa, AZ. The staff there has the absolute worst bed side manner of any company I have dealt with. Every single rep there was completely indifferent to my situation, refused to help and failed to come up with reasonable solution. I then talked to corporate; they tried to help, but had me talk to the store manager. The manager didn't really listen to my complaint and refused to help or come up with a reasonable solution. Once again I called corporate for help, and was dumped back to the store. However, this time I spoke to the most appalling depiction of a customer service rep (Greg). After telling me what happened, arguing with me and refusing to even simply listen to my story, he caused me to escalate. This employee should never be allowed to answer any phone call; I am now considering the value of my Sprint service because of him. I would rather pay more money to another company, than know that a piece of my bill can support such a dreadful employee. In the end, a supervisor at corporate was able to come up with a simple solution to my problem. After spending 3-5 hours of my time to get this figured out when it could have resolved at the store in 30minutes.... I will not be recommending Sprints service to anyone, and I will be telling everyone I know about the outright terrible customer service that I received from Sprint Store 6736 E Baseline Rd #104, Mesa, AZ. Brittany, Jeff, Ryan and especially Greg... Thanks for ruining what I thought was a good service."
4,"Student dentists are caring and compassionate and eager to do their best.  They are also humble and smart enough to ask for help when they need it.\n\nNOTE: I'm biased because I'm a student dentist here.\n\nThe faculty here is amazing.\n\nIf you have lots of time and not as much money, this is a good option for you.  \n\nUpsides of being a patient here: you have multiple eyes looking so you know you're getting the best of care and it's less expensive than going to a private office.\n\nDownsides of being a patient here: appointments can take up to 3.5 hours long each time and there is a long process to things because it is a teaching clinic."
0,Talk about rude! I called to make a yearly physical appointment for my day off. I was told that my doctor was out that day. I asked to see another doctor and was told I couldn't. Then I was told that if I changed doctors it would be a male and that I wouldn't be able to change I back. I hung up. \n\nI should also mention that my husband went to the ER and needed to follow up with his doctor at this same office. He called twice to make an appointment and never received a return call. \n\nThey clearly don't care.
2,"I always enjoy going here.\nSince the books are nearly always used, they are nearly all inexpensive.  The variety is wide, the store well organized.\nYou won't get far if you ask about a particular title, since they don't have every book in a computer.  The fun is in browsing, and just seeing what you will find.\nAs some people have said, when you sell to them you may not get a ton of money. I don't expect to, since many of the books are not \""current\"" and may be on the shelf for a long time.  It's still better than a donation if you want a couple bucks. (Nothing against donations--I do that all the time at things like Goodwill, etc.)"
1,"Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay $30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create their won meat mix of different cuts, mix their beef with ingredients or at least season their meat. The toppings on top are great but they don't add flavor to the actual hamburger patty. My wife got the Kobe burger..of course a $9 Kobe burger isn't really Kobe beef but it was flavorless as well."

I wanted to purchase 2 of these work benches at http://www.searsoutlet.com/Height-Adjustable-Clamping-Table/d/product_details.jsp?pid=13011&mode=seeAll&zipChange=true.

1,"Was craving some wings so thought we'd catch the game here and indulge. Needless to say I told my wife I'm definitely done with Hooters. The wings aren't that great, they're overpriced and they don't hire their waitresses for good service. Arguably, they don't hire them for their looks either - doh!"
1,"I purchased a whole bedroom set and was told by the sales person, \""The furniture will be delivered in 30 days, but you can always call up and reschedule for an earlier date.\""  She also told me that the furniture was at the factory and there were, \""10 of these and 20 of those!\"".  WRONG!  When the date came, they told me it was not available and told me next week.  The week came and I got the same thing!   I had been waiting about 45 days when I was told a a customer service rep that my furniture was still not available.  I called customer service and everytime I call, the line gets disconnected and I have to redial.  I finally got thru after about 30 minutes only to be told by a rude rep \""You should read the back of your order form for our disclosures. We have the right to delay your furniture due to our factory in Wisconsin and you're in Arizona.\""  I asked to escalate the call to a manager and the agent refused.  I then called the manager at the store in Superstions Springs and she was kind enough to apologize on how the customer service rep treated me.  She was able to get me my bed and the mirror in on 7/19 and the rest of my furniture in on 7/24 (I hope it does get here on time) when I bought my furniture on 6/10.  The furniture is beautiful but the wait is way too long.  The salespeople need to be retrained and should not lie to customers.  The customer service department needs a major overhaul!  They are horrible!  They have no sympathy and when they can't give you an answer they try to get you off the phone.  I  will be extremely hesitant to buy anything else at Ashleys and only recommend them to people ONLY if they want to wait 2 months to get their furniture!"
0,Got some new furniture and when delivered a end table was damaged.  I told them I wanted a new replacement.  Ashley's makes you go thru the repair process before they will replace the item.  I was livid as I did not want a brand new table repaired...Really Ashley's!  I will NEVER buy from them again!!!!!!
0,We purchased what we were told was great quality furniture for our bedroom.  Now mind you it is over 5 years old. When we received it one of the drawers had come apart. Well we thought its okay that could happen. After 5 years of use it is falling apart. 3 of the handles have broke off as well as the drawers coming apart on the bottoms. I did call and ask if they had a repair shop of any kind to help us repair the furniture. I was told sorry they don't. Lesson learned we will not be buying anymore furniture from them. Ashleys is a large company they probably sell better quality stuff. My suggestion is learning about furniture before handing out your hard earned money is wise. On the hunt for a new bedroom set we go...

1,"If you are coming for breakfast or a burger and fries and a shake, this is your place.  I have tried 2 of the regular meals, the ground round dinner and the smothered chicken.  I had to send the smothered chicken back because it was floating in water and the green peppers on top were pickled peppers that had a sweet taste.  Not a good surprise.  This is not the place to go if you are a healthy eater, which I try to be.  I normally can find SOMETHING healthy on every menu,  but this food was too greasy and strange tasting.  The only reason we went there was a buy one, get one meal free coupon.  The servers, however, are very friendly and helpful."

Turns out they have a decent happy hour with assorted drink specials, half off selected apps and a pick 2 food special that runs open to close for $6.99. I selected the Tortilla soup and cheese enchiladas. The soup was good and enchiladas was also good and came with rice and beans. Our server was great and I wish I remembered her name but after a couple of the happy hour Margaritas names escape me."

1,"I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said \""uhh it's at the bar!\"" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only."
1,"We went here recently was surprised it was not as busy as usual - Server was fine and the hostess but the food was awfully bland and tasteless.\nThe Marinara sauce was so plain with no salt or spices . We may just have been served canned tomatoes. Salad was ok the first time but when we ordered a second bowl the server did not ask about the cheese nor were there peppercinis or onions. Just plain lettuce. Wont be going back again too soon,,,,,"
3,"Fast, friendly service with good plate dishes.  I was excited to see they had lau lau, which I had always heard about from people that lived in Hawaii, but had never tried before.  Since I've never had lau lau before, I can't really speak to how authentic it is, but it was pretty good in my opinion.  The taro leaf it was wrapped in tasted a bit briny, and like seaweed, which tasted a bit weird to me, but it did remind me of eating something from the islands.  The pork inside though was delicious- slow cooked, full of flavor.  The lau lau also comes with a side salad, and a side of meat, which makes for a very filling and satisfying meal.  I chose the Hawaiian salad, which was kind of like the Hawaiian version of vinegar-based coleslaw.  It was a nice mix of tangy and crunchy.  I chose the kalua pork, which was excellent.  It was slow roasted and tender, with a nice smokey, salty flavor.  I also tried some katsu chicken, which was very nice and crispy, and came in a tangy dipping sauce.  If I'm ever in the area, this is the place to stop and grab a tasty Hawaiian style plate."
3,"Love this place! I don't go often enough because I never pass it. It's close to my neighborhood but I rarely drive in that\ndirection.\n\nNonetheless, I'm a big fan! Prices are amazing compared to the quality for \""fast food.\"" They prepare the food to order.\n\nTheir tender and delicious teriyaki chicken and their garlic shrimp are must-haves for my fam! The BBQ ribs are a hit for the kids too.\n\nFriendly service. Happy place. Casual and relaxed atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Try it."
3,"Having lived in Hawaii I can say the food and atmosphere are legit.  Definitely not a chain place..and they have a lot more on the menu the other Hawaiian BBQs such as malasadas and poke.  We really liked the Katsu, Kailua Pork and Kalbi plate lunches with all fixings.  We've already been back within the same week after our initial visit.  Solid local grinds..can't wait to check out the luau."
2,"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting it to be campy, and it was, but there also was a good amount of production involved in the live music show.  \n\nThere were several other acts (hoop dancer, magic show, gun fight) going on through the evening that each performer venue directed the crowd to (and kept the night moving), but the real gem here is the main music show.  \n\nI'm amazed that this family is still doing their show, and it is incredible.  A musician myself, I'm usually leery of such acts, but their band had a magnetic energy (and playful onstage banter), Big Jim and Sweet Mary can still SANG and their fiddler rivals the speed of light!  Very tight harmonies, a medley of moving patriotic songs & spirituals, and a healthy amount of crowd interaction.  \n\nThe band serves you through the dinner line, engaging visitors when the line lulls.  It is a humbling realization when you see them up on stage after dinner doing their thing.  They ran out of chicken about 2/3 of the way through the line and gave out ice cream vouchers to those people.  However, even without the chicken, they fill your plate.  I did not leave hungry.  \n\nI bought 2 vouchers through BuyWithMe for \""2 VIP tickets for a barbecue buffet, ice cream, and high-energy stage show\"" for $40 (so, $20/person).  According to their website that should include \""VIP Seating / Includes Chicken and Beef Combo Meal\"" and costs $36 per person.  What actually happened: it was not a buffet, but cafeteria style - one run through, one serving of each.  We did not receive ice cream vouchers with our dinner tickets, and did not receive VIP seating, unless if everyone else used the same VIP seating vouchers, and we were just four rows back in the VIP seating (out of five rows total).  So, that was disappointing.  I don't think it's worth the full admission price.  I enjoyed it, yes, but, even for the novelty of the show, I'd cap the adult price at $20.\n\nOverall, though, it's a good place to bring the kids.  They successfully recreated a completely different era for children (and adults) to lose themselves in, and get some history at the same time.  There is a lot of standing for acts other than the dinner/stage show, so not the best option for older folks or those with back problems.  Also, you'll enjoy it more if you choose a cooler month - only the stage show/dinner is inside.\n\nMy final word?  It was worth the voucher price and was a nice alternative to the standard dinner and a movie.  If I go again and bring the kids, we'll pop in just for the dinner/show and leave afterwards."
3,"I stayed many a moon at the Golf Resort back in the 90's when it was the ONLY place to stay anywhere near Power Road and it was actually pretty much in the middle of nowhere with nothing of interest around it except for a HEB grocery nearby and a smattering of restaurants that closed at 9:00 because nearly all the nearby residents were retirees.  Imagine that!\n\nNice spacious rooms and a great place to get together as a group and grill outside on their grills, and if you played golf that was even better.  I understand it's showing her age these days and is probably due for some updating.  Still, it was a great place and hopefully will remain so."
0,"Worst hotel I have ever stayed at.  Can't even really call it a hotel as its more like a MOTEL.  We parked our car and the first thing we saw was a dumpster that looked like it hadn't been dumped in a month.  Beer boxes, cans, and bottles all over the place.  I stayed there last weekend during March Madness, but our TV didn't work for the first 2 days.  We finally had TV by day 3, but of course lost Air Conditioning.  They said they could fix it by 10 am on our last day.  We were leaving at 5am so no help.  I demanded we get a different room.  We finally got place in a new room with both TV AND A/C on the third day around 5pm.  Leaving the next day at 5 am.........yay! lol  When I spoke to the front desk about a discount she said management is authorizing one night for free.  So I am paying for a full 3 days, even though I only had a day and a half of everything they offer.  Its ridiculous.  When I went to give my credit card so she can split the pay between me and another person, i expressed my disappointment.  The lady said sorry sir, i can offer you unlimited drink coupons for the bar.  Are you kidding me?  I leave for airport at 5am and you think me getting drunk is gonna solve everything.  This place sucks!  Now I am back in Washington, and the person I was splitting the room with informed me that they charged her the full amount.  ZERO communication at this place, from check in ladies to management (who I never saw).  I swear the average IQ of the workers there was that of a 5 yr old.  Worst experience ever and I really hope my review helps people avoid this terrible place."

0,"Won't be back! Went there for Breakfast and the place was only half full, and a zero wait on a Saturday Morning...You think we would be ecstatic right? NOT! Everything was downhill from this point. I noticed they were using wait staff to seat people and check people out, this is fine for a small mom & pop, but not for large chain restaurant. Where was the hostess and manager...no where to be seen, that's where. This should have been our first sign. After being seated, it took 10 minutes before they took our drink order. I had to ask twice for a spoon for my coffee. Probably the worst cup of coffee I have ever had. After placing our order, we waited 30 minutes, then decided to walk after noticing our food sitting under the heat lamp for god knows how long (while our so-called waiter was checking people out). Be warned...stay away."

The food was TERRIBLE and so was the service. We both got the chimichanga plate, one pork and one red chile beef with\u00a0enchilada style. The food was bland and tasted old and nasty. The chimichangas were not really fried either. Server was just this side of rude, never returned to the table until we were pretty much ready to go, and never provided a receipt other than the store copy. Over all HORRIBLE experience. Waste of $ 30 some odd dollars. Never again."
1,"All of our food had a hint of Italian seasoning, which was strange and unappealing.  The veggie enchilada is chock full of zucchini (the menu just said veggie, and I had anticipated the usual peppers and onions...if you love zucchini, get the veggie enchilada and a side of Mexican veggies - also just zucchini - unfortunately I really don't like zucchini!).  All around the place is nice, service was friendly, but the food just wasn't good."

Sometimes when she fell ill and in order to have a peace of mind,  we simply brought her in.

All they advise me is I have a choice to go and buy some medicine over the counter, or just let her rest and drink plenty of water! I am somewhat 'old fashion' and don't believe in feeding too much drugs for my kid.\n\nI have to say that the waiting time is always long even is a scheduled appointment. Waited in the front desk can be quick, but after the nurse called you in and take the kid's temperature, weight etc. there is another round of waiting, as bad as more then 40 mins. The entire visit can be simply 10mins but take 1-hour or more to see the Dr.\n\nI understand this is a busy office operating in 2 locations, and when you call the front desk to schedule any kind of appointment, whoever answer it always seems to ask you to hold....somewhat under-staff?!"
0,"DON'T EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT CLEANING FLUIDS AND OTHER DEBRIS IN YOUR FOOD!!! We were eating at this location about 1-2 times a month but no more, not after what we saw today. We were seated near the food area and looked up to see staff cleaning the food stands and vents above the food and prep areas. Debris was falling in the food, and the cleaning fluids were being sprayed over the food. DISGUSTING!!! I spoke to the supervisor and she could not care less. Don't eat here unless you want to get sick."
2,"Played out here last week, right after they started drying out the course pre-overseed. This was the first time I had played it in about eight years, but my feelings are still the same: I could take it or leave it.\n\nIt's got some boring holes, some Mickey-Mouse holes, some interesting shots, tons of water, flattish greens, and overall nothing overly exciting. We only came out because it was $28 on a Saturday morning with lunch and two drinks included. It was definitely worth that deal, but that's the most I would pay to play here.\n\nIn regards to the other review from just a few months ago, and the picture of the terrible greens, the greens DO NOT look like that anymore. They were lush to the point of being a little slow. I didn't see a single dead spot on the greens, so that issue seems to be over. I never would have known they were having such bad issues just 7-8 weeks ago if not for seeing the reviews here.\n\nThe restaurant grub was above average and they had several good beers on tap."
3,"Played here on 9/7/13 and the course was good! Some very challenging holes with a couple demanding landing areas from the tee box. The greens were all in pretty good shape, although there were several patches on a few fairways that had little to no grass. It was tough to read some of the greens - sometimes I would read a break and it would go straight, then other times it looks fairly straight and would break several feet. \n\nIn reply to another review, all of the water containers were full of cold water. \n\nOne of the carts in our group did run dead on the 17th tee box, so we pushed it with the other cart the rest of the way. It did take a long time to play our round because we were backed up behind people who looked like they were playing golf for the first time. \n\nOverall, I would play here again. Challenging course with cheap greens fees."
2,"It's K Mart, not bad just nothing special. Nothing really sets K Mart apart from any of the other conglomerates. Gotta shop here from time to time for MH exclusives so you'll see me busting out my Maverick patch & showing it off with pride"
1,"As all of you guys who read this may know that there are tons of Starbucks to choose from, this is unfortunately not the one I would go back in the morning rush hour time. I am sure the majority of the cafe in the morning makes you wait, but I thought this was one of the place that took forever to even take your order.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere and  store interior is clean and moderate volume. Once you order what you want, it will not take too long to get your product. Only thing that irritate me is the line that took forever to order the coffee."
0,"Caution when buying a used bike from these guys.\n\nI realized that buying a used bike would cost me more than if I bought it directly from a person directly.  I believed the trade off would be that the dealer would have thoroughly gone through the bike before putting it for sale  (Oh so I should not need a second opinion from soemone else).\n\nI tried to test drive the bike before purchasing it, but the solid answer was no.  Under no circumstances do they let you test drive (OK I get the insurance issue, even though I have my own).  So I couldn't get a second opinion if I wanted to.\n\nI bought the bike anyways, as it was the one I had been looking for (2006 VFR800).  On my ride home the bike felt and sounded odd, but I had previously owned a cruiser, so maybe they are suppose to sound and feel like this and I just needed to get use to it. I rode it the next day and it just didn't seen right so I called the Apache dealer in Phoenix (I live in Phoenix not Mesa) and asked if they would just ride it around the block and tell me if the bike was running as it should.  They got me in the next day (2 days after purchase) and guess what the chain drive needed to be replaced.  That was the cause of the odd feel and sound.  Instead of them working with the Mesa store, I had to call the Mesa store and work with the sale guy to let him know of the issue and ask what he was going to do.  We talked, he called the Phoenix store to verify and asked if I wanted to bring it to Mesa or Phoenix to replace the chain drive (free of charge).  I scheduled it for the Phoenix dealer.  While they replaced the chain I also asked that they look over the entire bike as I was going on a 1500 mile trip with the new bike in 2 days.  They did and said nothing else was wrong.  \n\nWow, replacing the chain drive made a world of difference.\n\nLater that day I was talking with some biker friends and they asked if they changed the sprocket too.  I said no, why.  They explained that typically the sprocket is always changed at the same time.the chain is replaced.  So now I am nervious again,  I take it to another mechanic and have them do a once over to see if It needed anything.  Guess what...it did.  Some how both dealerships missed the fact that there was too much oil.  Not a little over but alot about a cup (He showed me).  So I had him drain it to an acceptable level.  Also the clutch fluid needed to be changed.  He said I could hold off until after my trip.\n\n Ok so I bought a used bike from a dealer who abviously doesn't / didn't  do a full inspection before selling it and I had to spend my time and money to correct things they should have done or told me about.\n\nI can't speak to the new bikes, but if you buy a used bike from these guys plan on spending more money to have it inspected again as they don't do a thorough job."
2,Its Home Depot. Decent prices & decent materials. convenient locations
4,"This place is awesome! I was recommended here by a family member and couldn't be happier. I am my dogs parent and I do everything to keep them healthy and safe. Shot on time, extras if needed, etc... This place has never pushed anything that was not needed. I have even had phone conversations with the vet, that allowed me to treat without heading into the office. Yes, I respect my dogs and the vets their, and they do the same for good owners. Debbie and Jordan in the boarding are amazing! All the front office girls are amazing, the vets are amazing! I wish I could name everyone, but they know who they are. My puppies Leona and Oreo love heading over and I would never hesitate at anything they recommended, as I know they have the best interest of my pets in mind! Great Great Staff, professional clean, respectful and vauable!"
2,"Not sure why ppl are saying they have bad pizza because it was pretty good to me.  However, I am debating whether the childhood nostalgia memories are kicking in.  From what I remember as a child I loved the pizza here! We came on a weekday for dinner, felt weird cause 2 adults, hahah whatever no shame.  We got a pizza and the wings, both were sooo good! The games are pretty old because I remember playing them as a child.. can't really comment on anything else except they have REALLY SLOW SERVICE.  It took 10 mins for someone to come to the front.  After dinner we relived our childhood days by playing the games, full and happy.  We'd probably come again for the pizza and wings"
3,"I have not been to the Outback in years as past visits have, well, sucked. I am not one to complain, I just never go back if I have a bad experience or two. Seriously, there are too many good places to go out to eat to return to business who don't focus on their food. \n\nSo my boss loves this place and she wanted to go and of course as she is the boss I agreed to return to the Outback with her. \n\nI have to admit this place has changed. Our server, Bree, was excellent! A server can make or break your meal and Bree was on her game. \n\nThe food was really good, OK, I am super picky and was ready to hate it as I have in the past but tonight was different. I ordered the teriaki marinated sirloin. It came perfectly cooked at medium with sweet potato, salad and bread all for $12.95. \n\nMaybe I got lucky and came here on a good night but I am glad I did and will definitely return."
2,I really like this location and would recommend it. Quality food at reasonable prices. Outback has excellent blue cheese dressing and tasty salads.  Only problem I experience repeatedly here is I'm part of the few that prefers my steaks WELL DONE 2 out of every 4 visits its pink or even red.... Hey if I'm paying for it cook it how I request. That's y I give it 3 stars instead 4 or 5.
0,"THIS PLACE NEEDS A MINUS 1\nbecause I so have a beef with this restaurant. My husband loves steak. usually I am not a huge fan of going to a steakhouse but it was my husbands turn to choose so I insisted we go. It is not that I do not like steak only that I often find I prefer the steaks I grill at home to the ones served  out. I do however lloooove the fried onions alot of the steak places have but this one did not have one. BOO! Anyhoo......we decided to order what was supposed to be garlic-peppered fried zucchinn. It was fried nicely and not too oily, but I did not taste garlic or any pepper in the seasoning. It came oddly with a cucumber dip (I think it was creamy cucumber dressing) we asked for ranch instead. It just tasted off. I ordered  a grilled chicken breast that was supposed to be seasoned with rosemary and spices well again, no rosemary. My chicken was dry and boring. I ate maybe half of it.It came with a side of broccoli and what was supposed to be GARLIC MASHED POTATOES also another popular side item at most steakhouses. AGAIN, nothing but bad to say about both these items. FIRST. Frozen cut broccoli should never be served  at any restaurant. I only eat fresh steamed broccoli.When you list on the menu fresh seasoned veg of the day I think it will be just that fresh. Next, garlic mashed potatoes. Anyone that loves these knows they are made with cream and garlic and should be creamy comforting goodness. These potatoes were like I nuked a potato dumped the  insides on my plate and smashed it with some butter and garlic salt. When I  asksed the server about them because I refused to eat them , she said \""oh yes no we don't make them that way here we leave out cream because people have allergies\"" OMG! What a joke! CREAM is the best thing about em! what would be the point otherwise?I told them they should tell people this before they order. She asked me if I wanted a baked potato instead. I looked at her and said\"" that is what I have all I need is to add sourcream\"".(I don't think she liked me)  Oh but wait my husbands was no better. He ordered prime rib. They brought it out fully cooked! The server acted annoyed we complained about it.They brought out another piece- we waited another 20 for that and then they did not even offer to dicount our meal. In fact a manager never even came to talk to us even though I know the server did talk to him about our meal. Good service to me is even more important than food at times.I would NEVER GO BACK HERE. Mcdonalds would have tasted better. So I will be sticking with OUTBACK. At least they got the onion!"
1,"I'm not a black angus fan but my girlfriend is so i tag along,\nHere are a few of my observations:\nPro's\nGirls at the front desk were great and efficient\nThe waiter was helpful and courteous\nGood ceasar salad\n\nCons\nPrice...  7.25 for a margarita and 11.00 for a 6 shrimp cocktail ??\nBurger and fries 13.00?\nMy girlfriends filet was small\n\nIn the end...there are better values out there for sure. I dropped 60.00 on dinner and had a burger , fries and water. 13.00\nMy girls dinner was 47.00 !\nJust imagine if i ordered an appetizer and had a drink as well !  80.00 + No thanks!"
0,"This review is for Delta Mechanical -- both AZ & CO. I live in CO but also dealt with the corporate office in AZ. I've tried to keep the review concise as possible...but the reality is, I could have written 10 pages on how disconnected the company is and just how little client service is to their organization.\n\nAs a third-party installer to Home Depot, Delta Mechanical was contracted to install a toilet for me and my family. I placed the order and scheduled the install one week out for an 8-10 AM delivery/install to minimize delays or issues.\n\nAt 8:30 on the day of install, I received a message from Delta Mechanical that they didn't have the necessary information to complete the scheduled install. I talked to both the installer and the corporate office to try and resolve. \n\nUpon my first call to the installer, I learned that although he might be a pro at installing toilets, he was anything but when it came to customer service skills.\n\nWhen I asked him what the problem was with the order and what he might need from me, he basically said, \""I've already moved on to my next job. Nothing I can do.\"" \n\nUnderstandable, considering the mix-up...only, he had ZERO interest or motivation to help. I asked that he call dispatch to find out what the issue was or where the disconnect occurred....to which he made it clear that he was busy and that he was already on his way to another job. WOW!...so, I was kind enough to give him a piece of my mind and how unprofessional that attitude was when facing a customer.\n\nThat's when I called the office directly to explain my frustration, having had to take off work for the original installation time and then to be told by the installer that helping me couldn't be fit on his plate at the moment.\n\nThat's when the customer service representative mentioned that she had called me \""one hour\"" prior to delivery to discuss the issue...the only problem is that she was in a different time zone, so it really was only 20 minutes before the schedule install time.\n\nSo, I quickly learned that I'm probably working with people who aren't quite ready to run a business or to handle customer service issues or problem solve. She said she would have to review the phone call order and \""get back to me\"", but offered no estimated timeframe or next steps -- one hour? one day? one week?\n\nClear to say that my frustration continued to grow. \n\nDelta Mechanical tried to blame it on Home Depot, but I sat at Home Depot when we originally placed the order and confirmed that all of the information had been given to Delta Mechanical.\n\nWhen talking to the customer service representative and eventually the Delta Mechanical Manager (George Ramos), they confirmed Delta Mechanical only looks at orders the day of installation, which makes ZERO business sense and probably a good reason as to why I'm as frustrated with them as other reviewers. \n\nI'm still baffled how an order placed 7-days in advance cannot be reviewed or confirmed prior to 20-minutes before install. SERIOUSLY!\n\nMr. Ramos' plan to fix it included me rescheduling my afternoon (already after rescheduling my morning) and to give me their \""New Client Promotional\"" rate with an added $20 off. Now, my bigger question was, \""Why am I just now hearing about this  promotional rate now that I'm an unsatisfied customer and nearly two hours after the first sign of incompetence on Delta Mechanical?\"" Rhetorical question of course.\n\nI let him know that promotional rates are for customers looking forward to doing business with Delta Mechanical, and that at the moment I was pretty dang far from that...having taken off work, rescheduled my weekend, and after spending two hours on the phone bouncing from installer to customer rep to manager while experiencing some of the most dreadful customer service ever -- without any resolution, other than $20 off their promotional rate they failed to offer upon my initial order and giving up my afternoon on top of the morning already wasted.\n\nMr. Ramos' response was, \""It sounds like I should just cancel your order.\""\n\nTalk about CUSTOMER SERVICE!\n\nI did call Home Depot back and we're in the process of making the situation better, including using another third-party installer instead of Delta Mechanical.\n\nI know I'm just one customer/voice, but I let Home Depot know that as long as Delta Mechanical is a third-party vendor, I will be taking my future purchases somewhere else.\n\nAgain, we're in the process of finding a remedy in conjunction with Home Depot, but the ONE GUARANTEE I have at the moment is that Delta Mechanical WILL NOT BE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY, thankfully!\n\nPlumbing and HVAC aren't my specialty, which is why I wanted the pros to do it...but take a lesson from me, there are a lot of companies and people who can install plumbing infrastructure the right way without leaving a soiled taste in your mouth. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go with another company that has a better overall rating that TWO STARS on Yelp...you won't regret."
0,"I'm pretty irritated that my 2 pizzas, quoted at 19-29 minutes just took 1hr 8 minutes to get here. Completely unacceptable. I'm shocked it was even warm at all. Though the cheese was no longer melty. And James was hardly apologetic. I'll order from Val Vista next time."
4,So much Wrangler in here. This is redneck heaven! I will definitely be back!
0,"One star just because it is the lowest score I could give it. If there was a zero star option I would give it! \n\nWent there with a few family members, one being my grandmother. It was a busy Saturday and there were vert few bowling balls available. We wait for awhile and still had little lighter bowling balls to choose from. We spoke with the staff, which were NO help. They stated that bowlers were allowed one ball per person. Clearly most people there didn't get that memo. We asked if we should speak with patrons about which bowling balls were not being used or if staff there would be checking. They, of course, suggested that we check. So my cute little granny and I went to each lane and asked and of course, no one was \""willing\"" to give up a bowling ball. I believe there was some large childrens group there and seriously were lacking parental units. It was borderline chaos! We let staff know that most people were unwilling to give them and staff said, they would look into it. I also let the staff know that we would be waiting to hear back and that my elderly grandmother who happens to have hip problems could not lift any of the heavier bowling balls. We were in no hurry, so we waited another 15-20mins to hear back from staff. We decided to go ahead and maybe try a few frames out with the few bowling balls we could find. My poor granny could not even pick up the bowling ball let alone throw it. We decided to stop right away and end our game and make sure she didn't get hurt. When we went to return our shoes and let staff know WHY we were leaving. Their exact words were... \""Oh well. Bye!\"" This was from the MANAGER! Older gentleman with glasses and salt and pepper hair. He even tried to make us pay for the game! We hadn't even thrown one frame!! \n\nSteer clear. Shenanigans, poor service, and lack of respect for costumers."
0,I love Taco Bell! Just not this one. I now drive out of my way not to go to this one. The order is wrong Every time and I really mean every time. Bad service Bad food!
1,40 minutes for an oil change and then a hard up sell at the end.  At least they vacuumed my carpets.
0,My fianc\u00e9 and I were looking for BBQ on the 4th of July and decided to stop at Toms. I was looking for a reminder of how delicious BBQ is. For it to be the 4th of July the food was not satisfying. The ribs had lots of fatty pieces. The Mac n cheese was bland and it's possible that it was from the day before. The bake beans were straight from a can no unique taste. This place is good for someone who has never had BBQ before...
0,"This location blows!  From the smug attitude of many of the associates to the downright ineffectiveness of the work they pretend to be doing.  It really is awful.  Unfortunately, this location is the closest to my house."
2,Best buy staff are knowledgable and engaging not to happy with the venders if u will that are within the store but happy none the less
0,Had purchased a oil change card from a fundraiser so I decided to try out Brian's. I called and made an appointment for 8:00 am for an oil change and tire rotation. I checked in and was told it would be about an hour. It's 9:15 and I'm sitting here staring at my car in the parking lot. When I asked Rick how much longer it would be he said they were finishing up another car still. And it'll be another hour until my car is done. Just be honest about how long the work is going to take. I would've just gone somewhere else or dropped the car off if I had known it would take this long \nI guess if you don't mind waiting around all day for a simple oil change then this is the place for you. I however had better ideas for my day off.
1,"I would have given one star, but the exterior did look good.  I wouldn't recommend the \""upgrades\"" that they offer. Long story short, I was offered a wax and declined. Next he commented on dirt marks on the interior door, and the leather seats. He said as he was tapping my drivers seat \""we can make these look like new\"" he also said that they were going to \""clean everything\"". It also sounded like he said something about leather conditioner for the seats, but I'm not sure because his accent was very thick. I figured I could use those services because the car is two years old, and the leather could use a cleaning. I agreed to that, and went inside to pay. The cost of the interior clean upgrade was significant, and I was expecting the job would reflect the cost of the service. The inside is nice. There are comfortable couches inside and TV. About 20 to 30 minutes pass, and my car was ready. I go out to look at the job they did, and it was very obvious that they did absolutely nothing to the seats. The rest of the interior was pretty clean but it wasn't an amazing job either. I commented on how the seats weren't cleaned to the guy who takes the ticket. His response was \""no, that is something different.\"" I told him that the guy at the entrance said that the seats would be cleaned as well. The only cleaning they did on the interior was: the windows, vacuum and Armor All on the inside. I would have liked to talk with the manager about the issue, but did not have the time. Instead I just won't go back."
0,"I love Red Lobster's endless shrimp and delicious biscuits however, I'm sitting here writing this review at my table because I've been here for an hour and a half so far and have yet to get my food! Drink refills are impossible to obtain because our server can't figure it out. In fact, he disappears for 20 minutes at a time without resurfacing from behind the kitchen doors. I couldn't even leave if I wanted to because I can't get my check! I'll update my review with food reviews if our food ever arrives..."
4,"Everyone at Excel is extremely professional.  I loved getting the photos of the status of my car repair in my email.  Excel took care of EVERYTHING with the insurance company and even helped me get the rental car through the insurance company.  Best of all, they did the repair very timely and even detailed my car!  I highly recommend them."
3,"Found this place b/c of Yelp and glad I did.\n\nGreat Sonoran hot dogs.  I got two and was uber full.  The first time I went I recall less than optimal communication.  I asked how many types of dogs they had, and the answer was \""how many?\"".  \n\nToday was the 2nd time and things went much better.  Very helpful and once again a great meal.  I also feel like it was a bit cleaner this time, maybe they straightened up or repainted.\n\nIt is in a below average neighborhood but worth the adventure.  Go for the food, not the ambiance."
2,"We have been going to PP for over 17 years. Dr Chiles and Dr Salek have been my children's doctors from the beginning. We have seen a lot of faces come and go. Now that PP has merged with  another very large group, it just isn't the same. I still love our doctors and that is why we stay as my children are older now and need less frequent visits. This office just doesn't have the same family friendly feel it once used to."
4,"Chicken is to die for! On a recommendation from a friend we came here. Wasn't expecting anything special. Boy was I wrong. Pizza was very good, we got the New York Combo, thin & crispy crust. Waiter was on his game & very friendly. Wish there was one of these places in So Cal."
0,"Horrible customer service. I tried to place an order, giving them a chance after their last fuck up, but I find out they don't even deliver between 1400-1600. When I called to place an order the man on the phone was very rude and condescending while informing me of this, will never order from this place again! STAY AWAY!"
4,This place is awesome. I always find an awesome find when I come in. I very rarely see small comic shop's anymore but this place is great. Whenever I go in the people who work there are just hanging out in the back but if you need help they're always glad to help you.
3,It helps to have reservations and to prepare ahead of time.....  Been twice and the second time was not a great experience.  ONE chef to 6 tables.....  NOT good for a friday night.  They were over booked and they had guest serving themselves drinks and water......  But...  It is a great experience!  and the chef we had was AWESOME!  GREAT food!
3,Food and service at Nellos is pretty good. Portions are a good size and the bread they give you to start the meal is delish!
4,Me and my husband LOVE LOVE Nello's! We have been going for years and it is by far our favorite place to go for a night out!
2,"Lots of different options and good pizza too! Our server was a little off, but mayeb she was just having a weird day."
4,Awesome pizza and great service. Super friendly and a pleasure to dine out here! Don't forget to try the grilled wings!
3,"I had a short wait on my visit to Dr. Harris and the staff was helpful in getting all my paperwork done. The Dr. was awesome, very personable and knowledgeable. They have a streamlined system and set me up the very next morning with bloodwork.\n\nI had my results available through their phone system 24 hours after that.\n\nNice, helpful staff, and good doctors is almost all you can ask for in a clinic."
0,Time after time this store continues to disappoint. I needed a pair of shorts so I decided to try this store again. I had great customer service last week and it gave me hope that this store had turned around. I return this week only to find that the customer is not priority here. I will go back to shopping online.
3,"There are so many reasons to love Chevy's!\nAwesome table side guac. It's delish and they will adjust the spiciness and chunkiness to your liking. They do great promos all the time, like buy one combo get one for a penny. Fresh homemade tortillas that you can watch being made! Fruity margaritas! Prickly pear, melon, etc.\n\nI am a very picky eater, and a vegetarian, but they are always willing to make substitution and make things totally fresh to accomodate me. This is one of the few places I will drive 25 minutes to eat at."
4,"I love, love, love Chevy's.  Their chips and salsa and the best.  The chips are warm and thin and the salsa is fire roasted.  The entrees are tasty as well but I could easily make a full meal out of the chips and salsa."
2,"I liked it, but my boyfriend hated it.  I might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something.  They have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends, but no way will he want to go back at lunch time."
3,"Weekly brunch #4 brought my friend and me to Mimi's Cafe today.  First off, let me say it is SO cute!  It's got this French sort of theme going on, and upon walking in, you feel a little Euro flair.  It was kind of strange because there wasn't really a hostess, so people were just kind of milling around the entryway, but someone would occasionally come by and seat people, so there wasn't really a wait.  The food options are really great here, and they have a seasonal menu from which I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I recommend.  They come topped with caramelized cinnamon apples.  My friend got the blueberry stuffed French toast, which is French toast stuffed with blueberry cream cheese and topped with some other fruit stuff, and he said it was really good, too.  Per tradition, my friend also ordered a side of potatoes, and what we liked about these potatoes was that they weren't hashed.  They were diced red potatoes, and they were seasoned so that you didn't even need any ketchup.  They were soft where they needed to be and crispy in just the right places.  We ranked the potatoes in the top two on the list of Best Brunch Potatoes.  \n\nWhat's nice about Mimi's Cafe:\n1. Jamie, our waitress, was super friendly and super speedy at coming around to top off our coffees (sidenote: the coffee, depending on what batch you get, might be a bit watered down).\n2. If you get the breakfast (with a side of eggs and either bacon or sausage) and don't go a la carte, you also get a glass of juice with the meal as part of the breakfast.\n3. The ambience is really cute and comfortable and family-friendly.  It's a place I would like to take my older parents when they come to visit.  \n4. Prices are great especially if you decide to go with the full breakfast option.\n\nThere WAS a little mix up at the end with my credit card not being returned to me when I paid, but when I brought it up to the restaurant people, they quickly apologized and was able to find it and return it to me.  People make mistakes, so I won't count the incident against them.  Also something to note: I'm not sure how crowded they get during peak hours, but my friend and I went around 10:30, which was a great time to go.  The restaurant itself wasn't totally packed, even though the parking lot would make you think otherwise.  That parking lot was kind of small, but it's not a deal-breaker, especially cuz there's a ton of parking across the street on the mall side if you're willing to walk (I, apparently, was not)."
0,"We went to MiMi's for dinner...after being seated, we waited 15 minutes for water and the bread, which was cold.  Our order was taken, then the manager came to tell us that they were out of Chicken-fried steaks, and our waitress would be back to take our order, again.  10 minutes after that, the waitress came back, and took our orders.  After 45 minutes, we still hadn't received our meal. When we asked, she said that the manager was aware of the \""problem\"", and would bring our meal out herself.  We waited another 5 minutes, then just got up and left.   We went to Village Inn, at Dobson and Southern, was promptly seated and given water and menus ... within 5 more minutes, we placed our order for chicken-fried steak dinners, received our appetizers and then  our meals before we could make a dent in the soup and salad.  Jamie, our waiter, was awesome.  He got the gratuity that the Mimi's waitress blew.  Don't bother with Mimi's....go on down the street to Village Inn for that comfort food dinner!!!  \nThis wasn't the first bad experience with Mimi's, at a different location...they regularly run out of menu entrees."
2,Waffle and banana chocolate chip pancakes are good. Service not so good. Had to wait for about two minutes for the hostess to show up. Waitress didn't smile at all :(
2,"Pretty good breakfast, but nothing unique."
0,"The meal chosen was tasty but I will not be returning.  As a first time patron, I was given free muffins, with extra protein...a bug crawled out of one of the muffins. Not sure if trying to sue them is worth the time or money so I just won't return and I'll share the video with others so they are informed. It doesn't allow me to attach the video. The muffin may have been carrot, not sure."
1,"I was there on Friday night about 9:00.  Not very many people and it seems that this place is short staffed.  No hostess, and only 2 servers for this large place.  My server was very good - he gets high marks!  The food was another story.\n\nI ordered the lemon sole, a side salad and that's all.  With tax and tip the meal came to $20.00.  The salad was nice and fresh and crisp.  The lemon caper sauce was tasty, the sole was not very good.  I did mention this to the server and he offered to replace it, but I didn't want to wait.  It was supposed to be \""saut\u00e9ed\"", the chef does not know how to cook fish!  It was fried and was crispy and tough.  Sole is a tender fish and doesn't need much cooking.  I was very disappointed in this dish and would not recommend it.  \n\nAs always, Mimi's does have good bread, but the rest of the food is not so hot.  This was what I thought a rather expensive meal (well not a lot, but more than $5 or 10!) and way not worth it.  Go elsewhere!"
1,I sat in the drive thru waiting for my food for 10 minutes and was not even busy.  slow service. And they gave me the wrong order.
0,"R.I.P. Salads N' Such... if you're looking for the Salads N' Such that you used to know and love, this ain't it.\n\nThis used to be a lot of peoples' favorite sandwich shop in Mesa.  New owners recently moved in and unfortunately the only thing that has carried over is the name and a fraction of the menu--most of which tastes nothing like it used to!\n\nFor starters, the service has been really bad.  On my first trip to the newly managed place my order was at first lost, then I was overcharged (which they thankfully fixed, but took almost 5 minutes), and then my sandwich was made incorrectly (a take out, so I got to drive 15 minutes back to correct it, with nothing more than a \""sorry\"" to boot).\n\nOn my most recent trip I got the same thing I had been getting for years and the bread was stale--this from a place that was famous for its fresh toasted rolls--the potato salad was mostly clumps of mayonnaise, the lettuce and tomato were both soggy and aged, and the cookies--which also used to be fresh made--tasted like something from a prepackaged box from the 99 cent store next store.  \n\nI took the sandwich back, no refund needed.  The new owners claim to have attempted to update the restaurant and learn from the \""old guard\"" that was here, but it's a pale reproduction.  They can follow a menu all they want, but if they're using old vegetables and pre-fab baked goods, they'll never come close to what this place used to be.\n\nThis was my last trip to a place my coworkers and I used to love."
0,Horrible customer service had a receipt and wanted to exchange something like I was told I could they told me they needed the complete original packaging which was a piece of cardboard way overpriced also
3,"I love that this Dunkin' Donuts has a drive-thru. I wish other Dunkin' Donuts would follow their lead. This location is very convenient for me as it's near a gas station and just off the freeway. Somebody said they had slow service here. I've never had that problem. Took my husband here for a little breakfast date. Yes, we actually set the alarm and went here around 9AM. Love the donuts and the donut prices. Love that they have coolattas and pumpkin-spiced coffee near Halloween. Love the selection of donuts. I just wish the coffee prices were a little less and that's all that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Love the breakfast but I think you should get two breakfast wraps for a buck, not just one. This place is staffed by responsible teenages. It's a clean location with clean bathrooms."
1,"We only go here for the beer selection. The food is ok,just don't stray from ordering pizza and you'll be fine."
0,"I can count on one hand how many times I have been to Old Chicago. In fact, I can count on two fingers how many times I have been to Old Chicago. \nThe most recent time will be my last.\nOur server was rude, forgetful and unorganized. \nI wanted to take advantage of the reverse happy hour, as well as my friends. We had a few questions about the menu and specials. However, our waiter didn't want to answer many of the questions and made us feel like an inconvenience. Once we placed our order, we waited for over 30 minutes for it to arrive. When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm, overcooked and tasted like bad leftovers. My friend received the wrong soup, which I wasn't too surprised as the waiter was clearly not paying attention to anything when we let him know what we would like. \nAfter requesting the right soup, we waited another 20 minutes for that until the waiter showed up and asked if we would like tequila shots. Uhm... No tequila shots-- just the right soup please. Mind you, this was second time he asked if we wanted to buy shots. Are you a When the soup arrived it looked like baby food.\nbartender? What is this place?\nStop the world!! I want off!!\n\nThe waiter didn't remove the soup from the bill, he was clearly frustrated as we requested our checks immediately. \n\nBad food. Bad service. Bad tip. Bad restaurant."
4,"We love ordering from these guys. Unfortunately, they're no longer in business. :("
3,"I have been eating @ Aloha Kitchen since it opened. I worked right next door at Nello's. I was very excited when Ray opened his doors. I could only hope the food was as good as I remember when I lived in on the Islands, and it was. \n\nI have been going here ever since. Especially since they offer Manapua. You have to try it. (Steamed buns, stuffed with pork)\n\nMost other Hawaiian food places don't offer them and if you ever lived in Hawaii, particularly Oahu, you know what Manapua are and know what they should taste like. \n\nThe only thing I wish they had added to the menu, over all these years is \""Pork Hash\"", Mmmmm I miss those."
4,"I can't get enough of their manapua. Or, really, anything. The food here is delightful. I love the coconut shrimp, the chicken Katsu is mouth wateringly scrumptious, the bulgogi is always delicious... heck, even the salads (green or macaroni) are yummy. You'd be best served to arrive early if you want manapua... they run out from time to time. But really, that just gives me another excuse to come back.  All this for a reasonable price, to boot. Aloha Kitchen, I'm always happy to see you!"
4,This was by far the best find for a long time. We went today Sunday at about 10:30 had a 5 minute wait. Really good for a Sunday. We ordered and got our food in a good timely manner. The food was excellent and the portions sizes also very good sized. I would recommend this location to anyone. We each ordered something different and all was good. Drinks a little expensive but still for a first time going there I was really impressed.
0,"I went this morning with my nana for breakfast. We were seated promptly. I noticed right away the walls were dirty and there was hair on the table top. The waitress was slow to take our order. They weren't busy. She took our order and a server brought out our food. They forgot our requested butter and catchup as well as cream for coffee. The waitress never stopped back at the table to check on us but stopped at the table next to us to ask them how they were. I got the spinach, mushroom and bacon omelet. The hash-browns were yummy, but the omelet tasted like it was cooked in old grease and I only ate 2 bites of it. I was dismayed to see they only serve one piece of toast with breakfast. It was dry and hardly buttered. Every restaurant I have ever been to serves 2 pieces of toast. Nana ordered the Beggars Omelet and loved it. However, both she and I felt our food was warm Like it had sat around for a while. We spoke with the manager before we left and voiced our concerns. Maybe it was a bad day & a bad waitress, but all in all, I will never go back here for food. This was at the Greenfield & Broadway location."
4,"I have eaten at Crackers hundreds of times and it is always really really good, but they have a new special item that is hands down AMAZING!!!!!\nNot sure of the correct name but it is a Southwest Pork Carnitas breakfast Nachos.\nPork carnitas, jack cheese, tomatillo salsa, layered on top of freshly made tortilla chips then 2 eggs on top, which I had poached. It was served with their country potatoes, which are always wonderful. \n\nWhomever invented these breakfast nachos needs a raise!!! AMAZING doesn't even give this special breakfast item justice. The flavors were superb and who knew nachos for breakfast would be soooo good. I hope it is made a regular item. We all know how BBQ nachos have done at other restaurants. They sell out where ever they are served.\n\nWell done to the inventor of the Pork Carnitas Breakfast Nachos at Crackers & Co!!!!\nAnd a big shout out to our server yesterday, Ty!!! He always has a smile, he keeps the drinks coming, and is always super friendly and professional. And another shout out to the manager David Q. \nDavid runs a very clean restaurant, is always roaming the restaurant greeting customers and I have watched him be very kind to his staff, which wins big points in my book!!! Happy staff makes Crackers & Co always a joy to dine at.\n\nFYI: the bread pudding of any flavor is one of the best bread puddings I have ever tasted all over the country. And yes, I am a Foodie!!!!"
3,wonderful wonderful friendly service and breakfast. sat outside but the whole place has a comfy family atmosphere. down home cooking!
4,So I used to go to Bahama Buck's in high school in North Scottsdale until it magically vanished! Out of business? Who knows why this busy bad ass little spot stopped serving Shaved Ice and Smoothies to the teenage masses. It wasn't until today (about 13 years later) that I realized there was another one! Hooray!
4,"THE BEST WINGS YOU WILL EVER EAT! EVER!  \n\nThey are so incredibly good they melt in your mouth.  These owners are LITERALLY the inventors of the Honey Hot flavor that people are now enjoying all across the nation...  They're the original creators of Long Wong's, which since they left, they're not the same.. \n\nWings Express is bomb.  Their wings are smaller, cause they invest more in their flavor than their size, which I couldn't care less about.. Their wings are just so good.\nI love food, love it... And this place is rad.\n\nThe only downside is their location.  With all the scary people in that area, it kinda makes me not wanna go there as much..."
2,"In town for the weekend and this place seemed like it could have potential. The food is homemade and the workers are nice. I ordered three pupusas: Loroco con queso, black beans and cheese and one with chicharron. They were good, but the didn't have as much in the middle as I am used to. Overall it was good, but I have had many much better pupusas."
4,"Excellent, friendly service for a great price. I brought my shoes in and 2 days later they looked BRAND NEW. I would highly recommend this place. They're just 1/2 block south of Main St. by the Nile."
3,"I may be the only female posting a review for Cycle Gear here so far, however I have had the same experience that most of the reviewers have had.  This is refreshing in the fact that I have been treated the same as most of my male counterpart riders.  \n     The staff are courteous and knowledgeable and treat everyone the same when you walk in (experienced rider or not).  Kudos to them for the great service...it's not like that at most places.  They have taken the time to answer all my questions and show me different options...options that I didn't even know I had! \n     I have not had any service work done at this location however I can comment on their selection and prices.  The selection is fantastic.  Street, cruiser, parts, helmets, gear, etc you can probably find it here.  If you can't they will offer to order it for you.  I like being able to actually see the product (quality, durability, fit) rather than ordering on-line...so this place fits my shopping preferences for most things.  I don't see that big of a price difference with most places (or on-line) as they have a lot of stock and selection.  There are low end and high end items that should fit most budgets. They have some AMAZING sales as well...I get the mailer and am always going in to grab something while on sale. (maybe that is the X chromosome talking).\n    I am a happy shopper and will be back."
1,I would give 5 STARS to my ultra sound tech who did my ultrasound! She was very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. She talked me through the whole process. She did a great job and deserves to be acknowledged! She is very good at what she does!\n\nI give the two stars for the disorganization. I filled out the paperwork online early so that I didnt have to do it in the office before my appointment. They didnt have the paperwork on file and I had to refill all of the paperwork out. Plus they could/should be a little more friendly at the desk. \n\nAs for the doctor I saw. I don't even remember her name.....She was not that friendly. I'm not sure if I'm just picky because my other OB has great bedside manner and is really friendly or what......All in all I will not be going back to this place (hopefully) unless it is a necessary referral.
0,"I honestly can't say I've been to a worse cycle store. I've dealt with this place in both parts and service and they get nothing right. I've ordered parts that, after explaining in detail what I need, had the wrong part ordered. \""I know exactly what you're talking about.\"" Famous last words. Common parts that they don't even stock. \n\nI took my bike there to have a service done. The guy told me there would be a wait because they have so much work ahead of my bike. I'm patient, but after almost 2 weeks, right when I'm about to call, I get a LETTER IN THE MAIL saying they DON'T HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER to contact me. I called them and they not only had a number, but the RIGHT NUMBER. I had to wait for something in the mail when these guys had my number. The service guy said it was some woman's number. I called my number from work. It was the generic computer voice. Yes, a female computer voice. \n\nWhen I called back a couple of days later, he said he'd been trying to call that number, but it still didn't work. Every phone I used reached my phone. Two days later, the one person in a motorcycle store who knows how to use a phone called me (same number) to tell me the bike is ready. This is THREE WEEKS LATER. To make up for it, they took a couple bucks off the bill. \n\nNow I have a motorcycle that I'm going to have to piece together after having to take it apart and learn how to FIX WHAT THEY BROKE. Loose hoses, incomplete work, garage full of pulled apart  motorcycle pieces. It was an expensive lesson to learn, but I will NEVER set foot in this place again and will steer any friend I have away from this DUMP."
0,"Although the staff is very friendly, actually getting them to do anything is difficult at best. We had been working with them for nearly six months on the design and pricing until having to finally give up because they never once hit their own deadlines. While we've known several people who have had good experiences, we apparently were not so lucky. If you cannot keep your promises while you're quoting the business, you cannot be trusted to keep them once we've committed. You have lost our business and  any opportunity that we would ever refer you to anyone."
0,"Stopped by this market was actually looking for the u pick peaches place.  Went into the store some of the veggies looked old.  Found 2 strawberries & a couple tomatoes, went to the counter checked out and she said $3.01 but the store charges $.50 to use a debit or credit card so it was $3.51 I said oh I did not see that I have cash in my purse and the lady said it already went through.  I explained I did not know they charged a fee and she spouted off it cost me $.90 and very unprofessional said do you want your $.50 back. I understand business & costs and this is one I will now AVOID."
0,"I called ahead and made a 3:30 appointment for a haircut so I wouldn't have to wait. I arrived on time and told the receptionist that I had an appointment with Kelli. Rather than tell Kelli I was there waiting, this arrogant woman ignored me and continued to talk on the phone for maybe 10 minutes before I got angry and left. No way would I go back to this business. They are obviously unable to hire front-desk employees with a minimum level of competence."
1,"This location seems to go through an abnormally large number of new staff constantly. I have not had a problem with getting the correct order, but customer service is very hit and miss."
2,Stop by for dinner last night and place has good food and service was attentive here. Prices are good and the atmosphere is good. I be back later to see if the place stay consistent with service and food.
1,"The good news is the restaurant seemed clean, the steak sub was better than expected and the fries, which were requested crispy, were very good. \nBut the reality is I probably won't be back. It is obvious that they cut a lot of corners and I don't eat out to get lower quality than I could get at home. The fettuccini alfredo with broccoli was well proportioned with pasta (the cheapest part of the dish) but mainly broccoli stems with 2 florets with what tasted like watered down jarred sauce, the mashed potatoes tasted instant, the soup was canned, coffee was never refilled, service was mediocre and atmosphere was lacking. \nIt's not horrible, but nothing to get excited about and although I usually have a 'give it two tries' policy, I'm pretty sure I'm breaking it this time. Life is too short for mediocre!"
0,"Slow, disorganized service and a very rude manager who did absolutely nothing to help the wait staff or us. This isn't the first time we've experienced this service, but it's definitely the last. The patio is nice, but there are other options in the area with better service and food."
0,This review is only for the food and drinks on the patio.  The view is beautiful!  But the food and drinks were lame.  \n\nI used to work here in the late 80's and the kitchen was so filthy that I swore I would never eat there again (food was good back then) - I can tell you stories!\n\nThis past weekend we were at the Renaissance Festival and since my mom lives near the resort  we thought we would give it a try on the way to her house. I don't know if the kitchen is clean (one would hope) but the food quality is definitely poor.
0,Slow as fudgesicles.
4,"My brother took me here when I was out visiting. He really liked this place so we went here. I ordered the green chili and corn tamales and loved them! They had a kind of sweet and spicy taste to them. They were soft and delicious! This place is a little pricey, but very tasty and awesome service! We sat outside and there is a really nice waiter out there but I cannot remember her name. I would love to go here again the next time I visit AZ. \nP.S.... my brother is a crazy white boy."
1,"Nothing to get excited about.  The food is OK but don't go out of your way to visit this place....the prices are a little expensive for what you get and the food isnt any better than what you get at Filbertos.  At least the dinning room is nice, clean, and comfortable.  (unlike many other places in AJ)."
0,"Don't waste your time.  Blah food, horrible service, the waiter was very nice but seemed way over worked.  The salsa had zero taste, my daughters cheese quesadilla was dripping in grease, they never brought her sour cream, but charged us for it.  My husband and I shared fish tacos and they were BLAND, the menu said they came with \""special sauce\"" but when they came there wasn't any sauce, we asked for it but never got it."
0,Well we had guest from Texas in so v we tool them to the lake to see the area. We stop to eat and waited for 20 minutes for someone to seat us. They would look and just go with there own selfs. I ask should we sit down and was told no. Well finally I said that's it we left and drove 2 miles to tortilla flats and was seated right away and they were packed. Never agian will I go to canyon lake to eat .
2,The food was great but the service was not nearly as good as the food. I'm pretty sure the staff did not want to be there. Next time I'll just order take out.
3,"Great food, decent prices.  We got 2 breakfast plates and a coffee $13.99.  2 pancakes 2 eggs, potatoes,  2 sausage & 2 biscuits and gravy,  2eggs, bacon, potatoes.   We were seated within 5 minutes.   Service was nice and sufficiently fast.  They even made drinks to go.  Very awesome."
0,"Did not want to give one star. Horrible service, grouchy servers..... Worst service ive ever had. Do your family a favor.... Don't eat at golden china..... Especially if your Hispanic"
1,"I have been to this Village Inn maybe three times in the last 2 1/2 years. Each time could have been much better. This most recent was tonight. Everything seemed to be going well right off, but as we waited for our food a cashier asked a customer if they wanted their receipt to fill out a survey. The older customer complained about how she didn't want to do it if it involves anything with a computer and some other things. As she left out the door the two waitresses gossiped and carried on about the lady and were quite rude and even though we were sitting right next to the front desk, it wasn't hard to hear anywhere in the area. Many servers walked by and kept filling my brother's Diet Coke. No one touched my water for the longest time and it wasn't even a 1/4 full and it was maybe a 6\"" tall glass (heard another server telling other customers they ran out of regular glasses) and figured they would be back more often. They refilled it twice with water. However, brother got 6 refills no second thought on pop. It wasn't just one server, she hardly came back. Others noticed and tried to take care of us. I got the fish and chips with carrots. But it came with coleslaw and no toast. She said the toast wasn't done yet and would be out in a minute. Waitress didn't notice the carrot mixup. When she came back we were halfway done and I said that I thought I was supposed to have gotten carrots. She brought me carrots right out, still no toast or word of it. The carrots were very soupy and over cooked. They were said to be honey glazed carrots...\n\nWhen we were done our waitress came over and announced she was going on break and so and so would serve us now. Cleaned our table of plates and no one, not even other servers ever walked past our table again. Someone at one point laid pie on the table and was gone before I could see who it was. I thought the pies were to go, waited for a while, still no one ever came by. Stood up and laid my ticket on the counter and asked for a box and stated \""No one has been back at all.\"" Took my money, asked if I wanted a receipt, that was it.\n\n\nMy brother's fries looked like 'bottom of the barrel' fries as he put it. They were indeed very greasy and soggy looking while I was given a 1/4  of a lemon slice to put on my fish. My brother also stated the onion rings were very tasteless. I must say the fish was very good compared to fish I have had other places lately. \n\nThe manager was at the front desk a few times trying to show workers stuff. Hopefully he's new and can straighten things out there. I won't be going back after the terrible past service and to see that nothing has really improved and people were a little off this round, might not change soon."
1,Take your elementary-aged children for a short day-trip.
2,"I was looking for something to do with the in laws and this seemed right up their alley. It's a tourist trap, lots of  touristy stuff for sale and everything costs extra money. It was neat to see, got great pics and the history was great. Won't go again, once was enough but it was something to experience and glad I did."
0,"I was harassed, belittled, embarrassed and even physically manhandled by Jay, one of the managers. When I asked to speak to his boss because I was so insulted by how he was treating a woman he physically laid his hands on me, rubbing my back all while telling me that he was so high up in management that he could do whatever he wanted. I have never been treated so poorly, will NEVER return or recommend this place. Jay needs to be fired... or arrested!"
1,"C'mon Yelpers! 4 stars?! No way, jose. This place is nothing special and I suggest, if you are looking for a nice local place to eat in Mesa, you MOVE ON! Initially we wanted to try the little bar next door, but being New Year's Day, it was closed so we settled for this place. We walked into a dingy looking restaurant with old, dusty pictures and knick-knacks nailed to the walls and when we were seated, our server was short with us as if they were about to close and she didn't want us there. We all ordered some beer and I opted for the mug to pour mine out of the bottle. When I received it, however, I opted not to pour it into the mug afterall  because it was so dirty and cloudy that the very thought of drinking out of it was repulsing. \n\nI wasn't very hungry so I figured the potato skins would be a nice smaller meal but boy was I wrong! I was served 2 full sized russet potatoes, halved and carved out for the cheese and toppings. There was so much cheese on these potatoes that I literally had to take 3/4 of it off just to enjoy the potato itself. Also, they were so greasy that even in the short time we were sitting there the grease was piling up on top of the cheese. Did they even strain the bacon bits? I don't think so... Needless to say, I only ate one and lost my appetite. Also to be noted, the silverware was all spotty and looked like they hadn't seen the inside of a dishwasher/sanitizer in quite some time.\n\nThe only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because in our rush to get the heck out of there, I left my debit card on the table and the waitress chased us outside to return it. I was incredibly thankful for that!"
3,"This is the worst food I have ever had. Smelly Salmon, mushy broccoli, saw dust dry burger, rock hard ribs. Even the mashed potatoes were thick and dry. I understand this place's forte' is rock memorabilia, they should at least provide palatable food, not saw dust. They would be better off serving TV dinners. Stay away from this place. if you must go, then just have some appetizers and leave."
0,"Bottom Line - Rapid Collision Center 1.) Performed work to vehicle without prior approval 2.) Lied about receiving approval from my insurance company for the additional work 3.) Failed to communicate needed information to me in a timely manner 4.) Failed to communicate with adjuster about additional repairs in a timely manner 5.) Poor work done\n\nI brought my vehicle to Rapid Collision Center for repairs from a front-end collision.  They properly had an adjuster from my insurance company come out and approve certain repairs to my vehicle.  While they were preforming the work, they discovered additional repairs would be needed and decided to preform the additional repairs WITHOUT having prior approval from the adjuster.  I hadn't heard from them by the date they originally told me my vehicle would be ready, so I called to find out how things were going.  This is when they told me that they needed to complete more work and would need additional time.  A few more days pass with no communication from them.  I again call them to find out what is taking so long and I am informed that my vehicle has been completely repaired, but they are waiting for the additional work that they had already done to be approved by the insurance company.  I called my adjuster at this point to see how long it would take to get approval.  My adjuster informed me that he hadn't even heard from Rapid Collision Center about any additional needed repairs!!  I called Rapid Collision Center back immediately and they said that they were about to contact him.  A few more days pass and I call again to find out if the repairs have been approved yet, at which point Nate tells me that yes, the insurance company has approved the repairs.  He suggested that I come in and pay for the additional repairs and have my insurance company pay me back instead of them since the repairs had been approved.  This was a LIE!  My insurance company had only approved part of the additional cost, not the total.  I called as soon as I found this out, and they apologized and told me that they would be glad to refund me the difference if my insurance company didn't reimburse me after they submit it to them again.  Well, they submitted it again and again, and they were denied again and again.  I sent a letter requesting the promised refund - no response.  It doesn't rain very often in Arizona, but when the next large rain storm came through water leaked in and completely soaked the passenger side of the vehicle.  At this point there was no way I would go back to Rapid Collision Center to address their poor workmanship.  I found a different repair shop down the street and explained my dilemma to them.  The man took a look at my vehicle, told me what he thought the problem was, and fixed it for me.  He charged me for parts only!  Please, please, please, do not use Rapid Collision Center!  When I was speaking to my adjuster he even told me that this company was one of the worst he has ever had to deal with!"
1,"Waited an hour for a flu shot... Ridiculous\nI came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there. This was not true. My time is worth more than a $7 discount. Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return."
4,I took my cat and Chihuahua there for a bath and brush to get all the loose hair off. Did and excellent job! Plus the toenails were cut nice and short and ears where cleaned very good! My cat had extremely dirty ears and does not like her ears cleaned. I was very happy with the grooming!!
2,Friendly staff\nCrunchy munchy wrap was yummy\nSweet potato wedges with sriracha mayo was pretty good.\n\nWill be back.
3,I'm already a huge fan of any Cracker Barrel so I was excited to eat already.  This one is just as charming and cute as any other Cracker Barrel.  The homestyle cooked food was well prepared and service was friendly.  The prices are reasonable as well.  One of my favorite spots for home cooked food when I'm feeling too lazy to cook.
0,"Ok, to start I and my family have been to this one many other times and no complaints until tonight, 9-14-13.  We will never go there again!!!!    We ordered and both my mother-in-law and I had sandwiches.  She had the potato soup, I ordered sweet tea to drink.  Well it took a long time for the food to come and when it did another server brought the main dishes and  she noticed that the soup was not at the table.  So she came right back with a Cold cup of potato soup. I also asked for more tea and some ketchup.  Well the original server came and I had to tell her about the cold soup, ketchup and tea.  Scalding hot soup came. She left and a little later with, as it turns out, the wrong tea and no ketchup.  Left again and game back with ketchup.  \nThe tea?  Well I was not willing to wait for a long time and just put some Splenda in it.  We finished and left to pay.  The cashier was very cheerful and asked how the meal was and I answered \""eehh, it was ok\"" with a low obvious not happy tone.  She just looked at me but made no attempt to ask anything more, became quiet and just asked me to sign the receipt.  \nSo if they don't care why should I?  \nTo reiterate::::  never again to this place."
0,"Is no stars an option? Unfortunately, I made the mistake of bringing my out of town family here for a bon voyage breakfast.  I haven't had service this bad in years, not to mention half of our table was served their cold meals 15 minutes before the other half. When we asked the waitress if we could have butter (with our un-buttered toast) we were answered with a scoff and a forced \""sure.\"" My poor grandmother took one bite of her eggs and the whole table could hear the crunch of the eggshells between her teeth. This too was addressed with a passive response and nothing to be done about it. It was quite interesting to \""eat in shifts,\"" since each person received their meals at different times. I could go on with the continues wrong orders placed on the table and how we eventually had to learn to just except what we did not order, but, this experience was most definitely one for the books. Wow! I will never come to, or bring my family here again to suffer through the horrific attitudes of our waitress (to specify it was solely the waitress) and the cold crunchy meals we left on our plates."
0,"I you like egg shells in your cool scrambled eggs, cold toast and no butter, a look of \""I guess I'll get it for you\"",  a fruit dish with 5-6 small pieces of fruit for $2.60 and a waitress that has not been trained, then this Cracker Barrel is the one for you!!\nWhen you informed the waitress(???) about the eggs and shells the plate was taken and returned warmed up so now there was dried crunchy scrambled eggs. I guess by warning egg shells that softens them.\nAND TO ADD TO THIS....I GOT THE PRIVILEGE OF PAYING FULL PRICE!!!!\nOh the poor residents of Casa Grande that have to put up with this.\nIt used to be such a good enjoyable place to meet and eat."
4,"My first time ever visiting a Cracker Barrel Restaurant! We came from Los Angeles to visit with my brother, and HOLY SMOKES! This place rocks! Why don't we have these in LA?!\n\nIt was too hot to cook, so we needed to find a restaurant. I was a little hesitant to try them, because I live off of Yelp reviews, and the ones for this locations are not so good. But one of the girls travelling with us desperately wanted to go here, so we gave in.\n\nBeing the weirdoes we are, we all decided to go to the restaurant wearing ridiculous hats and speak in different accents. We had a train conductor who said \""choo choo\"" after every sentence, an Australian explorer, a Russian spy, a hillbilly, and a Texas cowgirl. We were seated right away with no judgments, which already was amazing, as I'd judged myself. haha!\n\nThe waiter LARRY was super nice; took our drink orders, and didn't question our strange appearances or bad accents. When asked where I was from, I panicked and confessed that we were just dorks having a fun family outing... He loved it, barked a laugh, admitted he thought the \""choo choo\"" girl was kind of strange, and went on to have a great conversation with us. Turns out Larry is fricken awesome. :)\n\nThe food was OMG good! I had the chicken fried chicken with macaroni and cheese, apples, and mashed potatoes. Seriously delicious! It was a huge serving, so I took over half of it home with me, and cost less then $10! My daughter got the sampler plate with meatloaf, ham, and chicken & dumplings.... all 3 were delicious! Definitely not something you'd want to eat when counting calories, but we were on vacation, so it's ok. :p\n\nThe ambiance is super cute. Old antiques gave it the country vibe, tables were clean, and there were little games on the table you can play while you wait for dinner! There was a country store at the entrance selling all sorts of knick knacks, tshirts, old fashioned candies, etc. We didn't buy anything, but had fun exploring the store and seeing all they had to offer!"
3,*Quick \n\n*Pleasant Service\n\n*Inexpensive for a generous amount of food \n\n*The best overall tasting Chinese I have found thus far in the Casa Grande Area!
3,"I went in for lunch looking for fried rice but their lunch special was extraordinary. It's a big cheap selection and so I was deciding between the Hunan beef and the Mongolian beef. What's the difference? The server said, Hunan is with vegetable like bell pepper and broccoli, Mongolian beef has onion. So I choose Hunan. You get to choose between egg drop soup or hot and sour and comes with an egg roll and fried rice. I ordered a tea to drink. The lady came out with a dish of those won ton crispies. Please see pic. And seconds later the hot and sour soup. Not even a three spoonfuls of soup and the Hunan beef came out! I'm very suspicious of whether or not this place has fortune telling abilities because it's like it was ready for me before I even chose it! \n\nAnyways, the Hunan was alright and I was super full from the portion. In fact, I couldn't even finish all my vegetables! I think, though, my fortune cookie says it all... It says next time try the shrimp. Lol. I will heed that advice. \n\nAlso, what was endearing is that while I was eating, the staff/family had a lunch while I was eating. They were eating lo mein and either chicken or duck. It looked like a nice family, chatting and smiling and sharing a meal. I respect that."
1,"Pretty lame, even for Casa Grande. Went on a Thursday night when they are supposed to be open until midnight. They apparently decided they wanted to close early because hardly anyone was there, so the waitress told us it was last call at 9:30 even though we had not even been there very long and were clearly planning to stay for the evening. Awesome.\n\nThe beer selection is very basic. Maybe two of the taps rise above the level of barely tolerable, for anyone who's into flavorful beer. But, I guess that's a function of their clientele more than anything else. I'm not a beer snob by any means, but give me something more than light domestics."
0,Gross! I decided to try the hotel restaurant this time. It took like 40 minutes to get my food and the pasta sauce tasted like it was canned. I could have microwaved better food in my room.
3,"Good meal, good food.  Very good wait staff.  A wee bit expensive, but that was minor compared to the quality of the food and the apparent cleanliness of the restaurant.  We were amazed at the number of folks that kept streaming in for carryout.  Since we've never been to the restaurant, the locals must have already discovered this little gem.  I'd almost give it five stars, but would want to try other items on the menu first."
2,"Just so you know, I like the owner of Bedillons quite a bit, so in all openness I want to just rave about everything, but I cannot, I must not, so here's my honest review. \n   It is hard to find good help in Casa Grande. Bedillons suffers tremendously because of this. I have been here twenty or so times, my most recent trip involved asking three different servers five different times for a refill of my soda, which took around thirty minutes to finally get, and this is a constant problem, slow forgetful service even on far less than busy visits. So you're asking yourself, why twenty visits if the service can be so bad? Fair question, and the easy answer is that the food is fantastic. \n   From great starters like the stuffed mushrooms with a sweet cornbreadish/crab filling topped with wonderful Monterrey and the rave inducing bacon wrapped olives, to great entrees like their juicy prime ribs and filets, or the much better than any other coconut shrimp I've had, coconut shrimp, they are seriously delicious. The food at Bedillons is a serious cut above other places in town. \n   Bedillons could probably use a makeover on the inside, and this is really just my opinion, I'm used to much more modern places, but it reminds me of a retirement home in a way. The knickknack/junk everywhere/southwestern/cowboy theme is novel enough and appeals to the older crowd that is usually drawn here, but for me, eh. \n   There is also a museum/shop of southwestern type stuff, not my thing but some people love it, and a neat little cactus garden. In all I most likely would give the food five stars, it's delish, but the unpredictable service is a killer. If you're coming through Casa Grande, you should totally stop in, it's a little pricey but the food is worth it, just try to sit somewhat close to the bar to flag people down so you don't go nuts waiting for a soda."
3,"One weekend afternoon I looked at Mr. M and said, \""Hey!  Who needs to clean the house, get caught up on bills, wash the cars, and eat leftovers at home?  Let's go drive around aimlessly.\""  He's such a good sport and always ready to head out on one of my escapades, so we took off towards Casa Grande.  There are moments I fantasize about getting out of the city and finding a more rural abode.  Those moments usually pass when I start looking at concerts and baseball games.  But still, wouldn't it be nice to have no neighbors, a couple of horses in the backyard, and 4 or 5 big dogs?  I think so.  \n\nSomeone had told me about some acreages out on the northwest side of C.G. so that's kind of where we were headed.  The drive wasn't very productive on the house-hunting side, but we did end up at Dell's for lunch.\n\nI wasn't too sure about it because from the outside it looks kind of suspect, but inside, it's a cool little sports bar.  Lots of TVs on the walls, and right away the server said he would change any channel to whatever we wanted.  If the Cardinals aren't playing baseball we're pretty apathetic.  I think we ended up watching drag racing or something, which always makes me want to drive irresponsibly.  And run out and buy a Camaro.  \n\nWe had their honey BBQ wings, which were very good, and the medium Chad's special pizza which basically has all the meats on it.  I have pictures somewhere and will get them uploaded when I find them.  Overall we really enjoyed our lunch.  Our server, JWF on the receipt, was great, and the food was very good.  The pizza is a thin crust style and baked golden brown on the bottom with lots of toppings and chewy cheese.   \n\nWith 1 pint of Amber Bock $2.77, 2 pints of Kiltlifter $7.38, wings $7.60, and the pizza $13.45, lunch was $33.85 after tax, before tip.  Really enjoyed the cold beers and the food and if we're in the area we'll definitely make another visit."
2,"This place had it's day...that day has passed. \n\nI used to love eating Ricardo's growing up, and once I moved out of state I used to look forward to coming here to eat when visiting family. Nowadays... Man, this place has plummeted low. The chile they serve with the chips is more of a half hearted parody of what the sauce used to be. The food quality isn't what I remember it, but maybe I just didn't notice the quality when I was younger. \n\n  The service is so so depending on who your server is. The inside of the place has been the exact same as long as I can remember it. \n\n   I love the ice tea here if that makes any difference. I used to love this place, it's a shame I still don't."
0,I went to get lunch around 10:26 and there's always some kind of hassle with these people. The rude woman in drive thru said we're not serving lunch right now. But when I went to the same place 3 weeks ago they started serving it at 10:20 WTF ???? I left this dump. What a lousy way to start the day. Cocksuckers !!!
1,"My colleagues & I used to stay here a lot back in the mid 2000's because it was one of the few hotels close to our AZ office. \n\nI returned here in April 2012 with a group, and either my standards have risen or this place has gone downhill, or maybe both. \n\nThe sleeping room felt old & tired, almost as bad as a run down Econolodge I stayed at in NM. The walls are thin - I could hear my neighbor on the phone. Couldn't make out what he was saying, but the volume was definitely there. \n\nThe on-premises restaurant was also not as good as I remembered. Some dishes were good, most had the potential to be good, but they just didn't quite make it. I had a filet, which I ordered rare-medium rare. It arrived more on the medium side but was still edible. My neighbor ordered the filet as medium, and it was definitely more on the well done side. \n\nI will however give the bar kudos, because they carry cocktail onions & the bartender made me a decent Gibson."
4,"Inner Vision has yoga classes for all levels and all moods--getting a good workout, moving some muscles before meditating, or stretching, relaxing and leaving stress behind. Not a mediocre teacher in the bunch--they are all wonderful! Monday night in Chandler Yin/Relax with Patricia makes the rest of my week go a lot smoother."
3,"Friendly, casual atmosphere with very tasty pizza.  Huge variety of toppings and an excellent olive oil base.  I find the pizzas with tomato sauce to be a little bland, but all of the rest have been fantastic.  Salads are huge and fresh."
4,Best pizza in ahwatukee hands down. It's also the kind of place that reminds me of home which is a great compliment.
2,"I really  like NYPD food and service. Don't sit on the patio though, they forget about you out there. I was disgusted and left from the lack of service out there. I did eventually come back because I like their food."
3,"My daughter and I had a mom/daughter day last week.  She had a dr. appointment and it would have been silly for me to drive all over trying to get back to work so I took the day off.  We went to the mall and she spent gift certificates for Build-A-Bear workshop that we had since we moved over a year ago!  She was so excited.  By the time we were done, we were hungry and she said she wanted pizza.  Well, it was Wednesday and kids eat free at NYPD Pizza on Wednesday.  So off we went.  \n\nI have been to the Camelback location several times and it was always good.  We now live in Chandler and this is the closest location. We were greeted and shown to our table and my daughter got some crayons and a plate to draw on while we waited for our food.  Everything here is fresh and I have no complaints.  The service is good and always with a smile.  \n\nI think the pizza is top notch and the pastas are great too.  The pasta portions are generous and I always have some to take home.  Great for lunch the next day!  I love the sayings on the back of the t-shirts too....Unique like a Brooklyn Accent is my favorite.  I think Tony Soprano would be proud."
3,"Crispy thin crust, and fresh flavorful ingredients.  Very highly recommended if you want a good quality pizza."
3,"This place is sooooo good!  And the customer service and delivery is great!  Win-win.  I had been to the location at the airport and was telling my husband about it, so we decided to order some for delivery and went back for a carry out order a week later.  The garlic knots are a must for us, they are awesome - make sure to ask for extra sauce if you are a marinara fan like we are.  As far as pizzas, the white pizza and bbq chicken are amazing!  We are going to try the buffalo chicken pizza next time around.  I highly recommend this place.  Also, if you check your mailers, you will find coupons for them pretty frequently - we had a $5 off $25 that we used this last time.  So if you are on the fence, use a coupon.  You will be glad you tried them!"
0,"One day I received a menu that was left outside my apartment door so I took a chance and ordered delivery for the first time and was extremely pleased by the quality and the taste of the food so I continued to order on several different occasions until one night, I was told (in a very rude manner) that they would be changing the route soon and would no longer be delivering to my address. About a week later, I called instead of placing my order online to see if they were still delivering to my area and was pleased to hear that they would still be delivering to my address so I happily placed my order over the phone. When the delivery arrived, the same driver from the previous encounter rolled his eyes when he realized that it was me and was rude but I did not engage him. I ordered two more times after this incident over a two month span and my food was delivered by different people who were very courteous, I even offered one of them water because it was so hot out but he refused. It was the most recent experience that will keep me from EVER ordering from this place again. The same guy from previous negative experiences made the delivery this time and as he was swiping my card, he began sighing and rolling his eyes. As he tore the copy of my receipt he waved it in my face and told said \""I'm not gonna tell you again, we will not deliver here anymore!\"" When I advised him that I had called on a previous occasion to confirm this and was told otherwise, he held up my receipt and boldly stated \""No one wants to come here for THIS!\"" and handed me my receipt. I took the receipt, said thank you and closed my door. It's unfortunate that because of this one delivery person, I will no longer be ordering from here again..."
0,"My girlfriend took her 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser in to get the Valve Cover gasket replaced, and the shop said the vehicle was too high off the ground to work on the engine. So they removed the tires to lower the vehicle and then rested it on the brake rotors. My girlfriend almost had a heart attack when she saw that. Then they split the cold air intake tube and said for $200 they could replace it. We both have Toyota Land Cruisers and we will never return to this shop."
3,"We found this place through Grub Hub- we have never been to the resturant itself but we have ordered their food for three nights and we tried a little bit of everything. Their eggplant parm is amazing and very tasty. Its as if they add something 'extra' to the breading that other places don't. My husband had a sandwich and he said the filling was great along with the dressing but the bread was a bit hard. \n\nThe appetizers don't fail- I go for the appetizer that has cheese sticks, zuchnni, mushrooms and artichoke hearts in it and it really wonderful. The deserts also don't fail. \n\nWe did try the stuffed pizza and we had mixed reviews here- I love it, my daughter loved it but since it was stuffed with ricotta cheese and my husband not being a fan of ricotta it didn't go over too well. The large pizza is HUGE to say the least and they don't skimp on toppings. \n\nI recommend this resturant if you want pizza, pasta or even a slice of cheesecake but their sandwiches could use better quality of bread..Other then that, Its a great place to eat and get your comfort food fix."
3,"I love love love Angel Sweet, I just wish it was not in Chandler! It's a little bit pricier than most gelato shops I have been to in Phoenix, but not a big deal. They have a nice variety of choices, but my favorite by far is brownie batter, but they only have it every once in a while."
3,Good stuff. \n\nWatermelon gelato is tasty. Thumbs down for styrofoam.\n\n Kid behind the counter was super friendly but the place was in a busy strip mall and deserted. \n\nThumbs up for homemade gelato. All for that. \n\nReally want for a place like this to succeed. Good stuff. Large portions.
2,"I gave this place 5 stars in the past but I have changed my mind since new owners have taken over.  They have raised their prices and you can only get one flavor for the kid size, which you used to be able to get two.  Thumbs down!"
1,"I tried Kisses this last Friday because a friend gave me a coupon.  $17.99 for a pedi.  \n\nThey were busy...too busy for my taste.  What do I expect on a Friday afternoon?  Most salons are probably busy because of the weekend...chicks got to get their toes spiffy.  It's not a large place and is crowded with equipment and tables.  I did not like the fancy pedi chairs either, if you do the roller on it, it makes your body jut out almost a good foot when the rollers go by.  Because of the crowd, it felt like a rushed assembly line.  Not a relaxing environment at all.\n\nMy pedi...eh.  She talked me into a callus treatment, which I did need, but she was a little to boisterous on the right foot, I had an open sore a day later.  I also had some blood residue on the sides of both of my big toes."
0,"Round and short! It is not that complicated. I was unfortunately very disappointed. They tried to get me in and out in 10 minutes, like really ?  They tried to just and file my nails and not cut them. After she was done and asked if I liked. I asked if she was going to shorten my nails and she started clipping them with a cuticle cutter. Basically I would never come back and would not recommend anyone to go here."
4,"These guys have never been less than stellar in the service they provide.  I have used them for years as a homeowner as well as CEO of medium-sized Human Services agency in the Chandler area.  These folks will help you with what you need, research options for you, allow you to return batteries without question, are very knowledgeable, and best of all, really not afraid to take a risk by trusting their customers.  I highly recommend them"
0,"Our German Shepard got a hemotoma in his ear.  It's basically blood filling his ear flap.  We took him here because it's the closest vet to our home.  As far as the visit itself, it was average.  The only treatment they did was to drain the blood with a needle.  No big deal, figured ok, issue resolved, keep pressure on it and it will eventually heal.  WRONG!  After doing some research online and calling other vets, what they did was basically pointless, the ear is filling back up with blood and the issue will have to be fixed with surgery in order to resolve it permanently.  Guess what this POINTLESS treatment cost...$400!!!!  The exam itself was $75 and a flippin' bandage was $53!!  We are FURIOUS!!  Not only did they do nothing to solve the issue, they completely took advantage of us in our worry for our dog.  We have called for quotes for the actual surgery that will resolve the hemotoma to several other vets in the area and the surgery will actually be less expensive than what these ridiculous people charged us for doing jack-sh!t.  Oh!  And when we called them to tell them the hematoma came back they wanted to charge us $40 for the follow-up.  If you have any concern for finances, DO NOT GO HERE!"
0,"Three and a half hours and nearly $500 later, I brought my puppy home in worse shape than when I had taken her in. They had put her \""in the back\"" in a kennel and either allowed her or didn't care to notice her pawing at the kennel door to the point that she mangled her dew claw. So after bringing her in to be treated for a seizure and vomiting, we left with no better understanding of or treatment for those issues, with the added bonus of a huge cast-looking bandage job covering her whole front paw and half the leg. Really? I had to pay close to $500 for her to sustain an injury under their care and to receive absolutely no resolution of the issues we went in for? Yep. Thanks for nothing."
0,"If you want to go and be over charged, or you like the switch and bait plan then this is the store for you. When I called and asked about their prices they stated \""our prices are the same as refilling your ink cartridge\"" BUT when I got there they wanted to charge me $1.oo less than retail. Order your ink on line, ALOT cheaper."
3,"When you drive into a self-spray and the owner apologizes for the wash stall being dirty, you know you're in a pretty good car wash.  When that owner is out taking care of the lot in 101 degree weather, you know it's very good.\n\nLos ruedas picked up a lot of Arizona the past few weeks.  Plenty of dust, mud, a sphinx moth almost as big as a small hummingbird, mosquito grease, fly bits, beetles and butterflies. It was time for a wash, since the wheels will be standing down awhile.  \n\nThe wash has a large selection of wash species plus a regular rinse and a spot free.  I really liked that the spray wand was soft-tipped.  If you accidentally ding your ride it won't look like somebody keyed it.  \n\nThe wash and rinse had plenty of pressure.  I found myself emptying all my pocket change, then shaking down the car's change.  The spot-free rinse was frugal.  A little better than a full-on drinking fountain, but effective.  Every place I rinsed was absolutely spot free when los ruedas dried.  \n\nIf you're in Chandler and spray off your own wheels, this is a great place for a wash and rinse.  I believe my wash cost about $6.00.  If you use a card, you won;t know how much it was until you see the bill, and you won't have to hunt every nook and cranny of your change-saving places."
2,"$4 OPI!  Read Carina's review, b/c I didn't want to pay $8.50 at Ulta... geez, so cheap... alot of the OPI colors already have separated (heat?  age?) so make your choice for price over quality... I'm so cool for $4 though.\n\nOn the same end where China Magic Noodle is, same plaza as Lee Lee's."
1,"We tried this carwash for the second time yesterday hoping for a little better results.  Once we saw our car come through the carwash, it was evident that there were too many cars and not enough employees to handle them all.  We ordered \""The Works\"" which includes vacuuming and wiping the interior.  The exterior looked great, but as we drove away, we realized that the entire dashboard area hadn't been touched.  The guy was obviously too rushed to realize he completely missed that part.  Third time won't be a charm because we probably won't be back."
0,"I get my car washed here a lot never a problem! Today I left with water spots on my car and they told it was because I parked next to a sprinkler and it was the hard water that produced the stains. Might I remind you that I get my cars (plural) washed here a lot! Wtf are these ppl telling me!? They said in order to remove them I have to get it buffed and detailed! Guess what? If the water spots come from my sprinklers, then every time I bring my car in for a wash, there will be water spots from the same damn sprinklers... because that is where I park and the same damn sprinkler will always be present! BUT I never left with that lame reason AND with water spots THAT IS ONLY REMOVABLE BY A $120 detailed! You ever wonder why your reviews are in the 3 stars?"
0,"I just want to warn everyone who might be renting at The Greens to READ YOUR LEASE as if you do not give a 60 day notice if you do not intend to renew your lease these people will charge you a huge chunk of money!!!   They will NOT work with you, listen to you, empathize with you, as it's all about the money and the fact that you did not read your lease.....they could care less.   They forced my daughter into signing her lease over email, did not ever sit down and review it with her and even though she gave them at least 45 days notice that she would not be renewing her lease, they could have cared less.  Just so you know.... you MUST give a 60 days notice or you are you know what out of luck!   Pretty poor!"
0,"The care I received here was satisfactory.\nMy complaint is every time I have called, I am on hold for AT LEAST 10 solid minutes.\nThe vibe is a little aloof.\nThe only person who has been helpful is Martha in billing. Thanks Martha! You are bringing the place up a notch. :)"
1,"Ive heard tons of great things about this place. I decided to get the #1 Two Chicken Enchiladas with beans and rice and it was bleeeeeeegh. I got a spoonful of so-so rice, beans that tasted like they had just come from a can and the enchiladas were even worse. \n\nNormally I dont give places second chances, but the service was good, and the place was very clean. I might try the chorizo or the carne asada next time. Definitely will avoid the enchiladas."
2,"Breakfast burritos are awesome!  Choose from bacon, sausage, ham ... or my favorite - no meat.  Really good food.  In a hurry or don't want to wait? No problem - call ahead and your order will be ready when you get there.\n\nWe usually place our order and then head next door to Starbucks and get our morning caffeine fix...by the time we get back - order is ready!  \n\nPrices are reasonable.  Service is good.  Food is what you'd expect.  Nachos, burritos, enchilada plates are all very good.  Taquitos can be a little dry, but hey - that's what sour cream is for. Right?\nOh yeah - tons of FREE parking!"
1,"Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.\n\nGet ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?\n\nOne word: disappointing."
1,"Okay food in a fast food ambiance.  I had the chicken chimichanga combination plate.  The tortilla was very crispy and the filling included some cheese, onions, and chilies.  The chimi was topped with generous helpings of guacamole and sour cream.  The rice was dry, but the refried beans were okay.  The Dr. Pepper in the soda fountain was a teensy bit watered down. \n\nMy husband was not impressed with his carnitas burrito.  He got a nasty surprise when he cut it open.  It was stuffed with pico de gallo and guacamole, in addition to the dry carnitas.  He hates guacamole."
1,"Careful, everything you feared about dentists are true with this one. I have come in twice with these folks, and both experiences were not great.\n\nFirst time I went in, it was somewhat OK experience, the assistant was nice and friendly, but however I felt he was still training as he probably dosed me with enough radiation that I had to look up the effects from Chernobyl from so many x-rays due to mistakes.\n\nNext the cleaning was really quick, and they did not floss my teeth. Finally the dentist arrived. he was very friendly. took a quick view of my teeth and then moved on to a slide show to show me the problems. Obviously I felt like this was  a sales pitch to try and upgrade to super human teeth to chew through metal, or maybe it was a scare me straight tactic, either way I felt uncomfortable and a waste of my time as I don't know what I'm looking at or if that is normal at my age, so blah. \n\nAnyways I spent total of 5 minutes with him and hes gone, got my goodie bag and left. \n\nThe second time I fear was my complete undoing of the place. Different assistant, felt like she had waaaaaay less training as well  this time more painful. She really dug in, and hooked my gums, I clinched in pain and she asked what kind of pain it was, i said acute pain. She said that was a cavity, i know she was wrong cause it was on the side of my gum that she stabbed not my tooth, i can tell the difference in pain. She did this a few other times, I really wanted to just get up and leave at that point and finally the pain was over. \n\nFinally the dentist came in, same sales pitch less time may 3 minutes. On the way out the staff was somewhat rude after payment.\n\nFinal conclusion: This is the first time I am actually scared to go back to them. I will spend the extra money to go out of network to see any of my older dentists."
3,"Great location right off the lake with indoor/outdoor seating, family friendly (Weds are family night), great Mexican food (yes, its greasy)-with about 10 dinner combos which can please just about anyone, AND we get a buy one get one free through the mail almost weekly that it just makes sense to keep coming back for more! =) Plus their chips, salsa, and bean dip just about seal the deal for me! Yummy!"
4,I wish I could give them 10 stars. The service is always top notch and I love the Chimi's
3,"First and foremost, always use a coupon. If you live in Chandler they should come in the mail every other week. This will save you at least $12. Everyone here is friendly. The food has never disappointed and I've been here about 100 times. There are many good selection. The shredded beef taco is big and juicy. It tastes amazing. The burritos are decent but are a little bland. The Chimichanga is good, but is it worth the extra calories for being deep fried? That all depends on your metabolism. My new favorite choice here is the Mexican pizza. It is huge and filling. There are so many different flavors going on. The chips and salsa here are my favorite(tied with Serrano's that is). There is also a nice patio outside on a pond with a water fountain in the water that lights up at night. It looks pretty cool."
0,"Rude, rude, rude.  The clerk today was put out by my business.  My fiance warned me but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.  She failed to greet me; didn't want to count the items; delivered 2 pieces of disappointing news with a look and a tone that spoke volumes (TOUGH),\nNo, little girl, tough for you!  We will be going elsewhere in the future."
0,"In thirty years of taking shirts to the laundry I have NEVER been charged for the shits being extra large.  Just moved to the area and was the first time I tryed this cleaner, had a coupon stating $1.89 per shirt.  When I came to pick up the shirts (33) shirts I was charged NOT the coupon price of 1.89 but $2.30 a shirt when I asked about the price I was told that the extra charge was for extra large shirts.  When I said I have never been charge for the size of the shits, he was rude and very short with me.  After taking the shirts out to my car I came back in and asked for the name of the owner since I was going to file a complaint.  He said he was the owner and handed me his business card and walked away.  What a way to treat a new customer, very rude, very rude.  As others have said in the reviews for this cleaner, go somewhere else this is a very rude uncoporative and untruthful company that has no sign anywhere in the store that states additional cost for larger sizes.  Nor was I told the coupon price was not good on my shirts when I brought them in to be cleaned.  The attorney general should check into this business and their business practices."
3,"Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a chain.  But it was there for us when we needed it.  My mother wasn't eating well on her own and my middle daughter lived in Mesa, not too far, so she would stop by Boston Market and pick up a couple of dinners on the way to visit her and they would have a nice visit and meal together.  Since Mother always liked what my daughter brought and ate well, at least we knew she was getting good nutrition from it and some leftovers for the next day.  \n\nWhen I was in town I would stop by there too  I always liked their sides and would sometimes just get a vegetarian plate of just the sides.  I liked their roast sirloin or whatever they call it too, for the price.  And their desserts were pretty good.  I liked that they had dishes that you don't find in most fast food places.  I never had a problem with anything I ate from there and they were pretty consistent in their quality so I give it four stars on a sliding scale compared to other fast food establishments.  I'd go back anytime I'm in the mood for good old American comfort food."
3,"A little pricey, but worth it. It's typical to spend around $15 for 2 people, which for fast food is up there. Even though the Yelp pricer thing say, cheap? Turkey with corn and mash potatoes and mac n cheese. Mmmmm. I only with they still had the sirloin."
1,"WORST PEDICURE EVER. I was just there this morning for a full set and a pedi. The man that did my full set was patient... he had to pry off an old set as I wanted a new fresh one... and I had just gotten a fill so it took a little bit of work. My only complaint with him is that he cut me pretty good with the drill and if it hurts this much now, boy is it gonna smart tomorrow. But I do love how my nails look. Thin and shaped perfectly. The pedi however is where things really head south. She did an ok job on the scrubbing, cutting and filing but that's where it ends. When it came time for the best part, the massage, it's like she was a zombie. She barely rubbed my feet, she rubbed my shins a little bit and my knees (???) but would NOT rub my feet. Thats the part that hurts after being on them all day!!  She squeezed them, pinched my toes, slapped the bottoms of my feet but still no massage. It was like she had no clue what she was doing. Definitely the strangest experience at a salon ever. The polish job was sloppy, polish on my cuticles that she didn't clean up. WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  Won't be going back."
3,"I've been here a few times and I like that it's right up the street from where I love. On Tuesday and Wednesday they have specials on manicures and pedicures which is $5 cheaper then the original price. So far everyone I've gone they have always done a good job on my nails. The only thing I don't like about this place is it takes two people to do my nails. One lady usually does takes off the nail polish, cut the cuticles and file my nails, then when it's time to do my gel manicure another lady finishes it up. Every time I've gone this has happened and I always have to double tip which is super annoying!"
4,Best Pho in Phoenix and the best price.  No place better and no place cheaper.  Me an My wife go back again and again. Very Very Very good.  12 - 14 dollars two people with water as drink. you can't beat that.
3,"The hubs and I are suckers for some good Pho and we haven't found better in Phoenix since we moved here. The restaurant itself is nothing special but what does one expect when you can get two bowls of pho, two drinks, and crispy spring rolls for under $15? We've never eaten anything else there but in the cooler months we eat here at least 3 times a month... sometimes more =)"
1,"Saigon Pho Falls Flat\n\nYears ago, my husband and i went to Saigon Pho regularly before choir practice to get a bowl of Bun Hanoi.  Once we quit the choir, and found Cyclo, Saigon Pho was no longer on the radar screen.  Last night, i craved a bowl of pho, and wanting to mix it up a bit, we thought we'd visit the old haunt.\n\nWell, disappointing.  The Pho Tai was flat in flavor, greasy and very, very average.  the \""salad\"" consisted of a handful of bean sprouts, a lemon wedge, one basil leaf (!) and a sickly branch of couple day old mint leaves.  \n\nIt was sustenance, but not a great food treat.  \n\nwe'll be moving on."
3,"Really Good Vietnamese food! Good Service. I always order the same. Pho Soup, egg noddle, seafood style."
1,"Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good."
1,"I have periodically visited Saigon Pho on Alma School for the last four years.  Today, our visit was disappointing.   When I asked our server to please use a clean wok when preparing my meal due to my nuts allergies, she seemed to be offended by my request. ( I've asked on prior visits with no problems.)I was made to feel, by this server, that they have high sanitation standards.  As much as I was hoping this was true,  my friend's spoon for the iced coffee had arrived with dried cilantro baked to it.   My other companion's Pho bowl had come with dried dark sauce on the exterior.  Mmmmm, not my idea of clean.  The server was sarcastic but we were there to have a nice dinner.  My entree tasted okay but the meat was chewy and cold.  The rest of my foodie group enjoyed their dishes but now I will just stick to Cyclo and Chandler Pho for my Vietnamese cravings and pleasant service."
3,"When you gaze upon it the aesthetic of the piece has a simplistic almost minimalistic feel to it. But on second glance, you realize the work of art is a masterpiece. It has tons of details with eye catching colors. The lines flow so fluidity. Some may say the work could have come from the pre-Raphaelite era while others argue it could be comparable to postmodernism. However when the piece is placed juxtaposed with a similar piece it is easy to see the differences. It doesn't end there with the visual appeal but it arouses the other senses invoking emotional reactions to it. For me i felt the warmth and comfort which followed but the tingling of my taste and nerves. Yes i am talking about Saigon's pho. It is a masterpiece, a work of art."
0,"Went thru the drive through recently and asked for a jr frosty. I had one of those keychain things, but I couldn't find it. After a five minute wait before I got up to the window, I found it. So I told the cashier that I found my key tag for a free jr frosty. So she told me my total. I gave her my cash and looked at my receipt and it was still charge AND she took my frosty card. I said \""the charge is still on the receipt\"" she said that next time, I need to tell her that I have any coupons when I order. I said \"" okay, my bad, I didn't think I had it, but you took my card and didn't tell me I got charged anyway and if that's the case, where's the second frosty then?\"" She goes \""here's your dollar and frosty\"" and then closed the window. It's not the money, it's about the fact that I was treated soooo rudely!!! Never going back there!"
1,"I shop at this location often because its so close to my home.\n\nThe majority of the time they have the products that I use in stock.\n\nThe downfall to this particular store is the lack of customer service. I don't typically need assistance on the sales floor since I know what I need. However if I did need help there would not be a soul around to assist me. I don't ever see any staff around except at checkout. When I get to the checkout counter the staff is not personable at all. I don't need a full blown conversation to occur but I would think a \""How are you?\"", would suffice.  Instead of talking to a coworker or the typical \""Do you have an Ulta card?\"", etc. You know the questions they are trained to ask . I would appreciate a thank you after my purchase.\n\nAgain I will continue to use this Ulta but only because it so close to home. If the customer service does not improve I will have a chat with a manager."
0,"I'm glad others have had good experiences here because I sure did not.  I went in to get my nails done for a special occasion.  I was so disappointed.  My nails were not smooth, 2 were on crooked and the owners didn't seem to really care that much that I was not satisfied.  Besides the language barrier, they didn't seem to understand that my nails were not on straight.  I wanted them nice and long for my special occasion but due to the screw up, I ended up with short stubby nails.  I have friends who go to the salon but there nails do not last as long as mine do from the place I go now and my friends who have their nails done here have had nails break, something I've never had.  I won't go back and give them the chance to screw up my nails again.  \n\nOne thing, they are cheap.  But then you get what you paid for too.  If I want nice nails that last longer than a few days or a week, I go elsewhere.  There nails are cheap, but they aren't worth the hassle."
3,"I'm a big fan of this particular PETCO and PETCO stores in general.  Their ethical practices outshine their competitors.  I also find that their selection in the amphibian and reptile section to be awesome!  They always seem to have my kitty foods and litter and treats on sale too.  I recently took my new kitten to see Santa at this PETCO location.  Santa and his staff were very professional and gentle with my baby.  The picture came out great, and part of the cost is donated to animal charity.  Great place to take your pet!"
1,"I prefer Petsmart better because they have a better selection and prices. I like Petco for their cookie bar so I can pick up some cookies that are friendly for pets for my pets. That's basically it, I only shop here on occasion because of the location. Go to Pets Inc in Tempe instead for a real shopping experience."
3,"Great location for finding better clothes. I have found East Mesa, South Gilbert, Chandler, and Northwest Scottsdale to have the best clothing at these Goodwills! I love 50% saturdays and service is usually pretty good! Just try to beat the crowd early on the 50% saturdays or go later in the day."
3,I really like that the free weights are separated from the treadmill area. pool is nice trainers are great too. I usually go after work and its never too crowded. they also have some great spin classes.
0,"Family Friendly Gym ?  I guess not any more.  I used to be a member of this gym for over 10 years.  Decided to leave because because I now travel for work and it was important for me to get a gym that was more regional so I could work out when I am out of town.  \n\nWhile the gym and equipment is nothing special, what really kept me working out at the gym all those 10 years were the members, many of them Veterans & Seniors that I had build a special bond with.  Over the years, I continue to visit them from time to time to catch up on old friends especially during holidays and special occasions.  Some members who are not with us anymore, I have even attended their memorial services.\n\nToday is Veterans Day, and I took it upon myself to take the time and go and wish the various members, many of them veterans of WWII, Vietnam, Korea etc. who I have known all these years Happy Veterans Day.  To my utter surprise, the attendant at the front desk told me I could not enter beyond a certain line because of insurance purposes.  These veterans were seated just a few feet away from that line of scrimmage and they were all sitting around the table.  This is like a small waiting area few feet away from that line, near the juice bar and yet I could not go and wish them Happy Veterans Day.  I could not in my heart have a 90+ year old veteran get up from his chair and get onto a walker and wish me and so I just waved out to him.  For all those of my veteran friends that I could not wish personally, I am truly very sorry.\n\nFamily Friendly Gym?  I guess not.  I used to recommend this gym to those that preferred a family friendly environment, but I guess things have changed and so will my future recommendations."
4,"As a partner in the property management industry, I have to say that this property has already seen so many positive changes in the past few weeks.  The staff is very welcoming and it has become one of my favorite places to visit."
1,"I must've come here on a bad day considering all of the other glowing reviews. I've got two things to say about this place: \n\na) It's very affordable.\nb) Up until I visited this place, I thought pizza was like sex. That is, there's no such thing as bad sex. Well, the Floridino's pizza just kinda laid there.\n\nI should probably try it again, even though my first visit was underwhelming. One more minor note, this place also has a full bar and it's the first thing you see when you walk into the place. Not sure why that survey question has been answered differently by every other user."
2,Good simple American Italian food. Prices are great. Service is pretty fast. \nAvoid Wednesday night as it's Lowery organ test night. Loud old-time music. Not sure why.
2,"As some one who has been coming here for years, I can tell you the items on the menu are hit and miss. My family loves the baked spaghetti, pizzas, calzones, pizza muffins, and eggplant parm. I've had several of there other pasta dishes (eg: alfredo) and was not a fan. You just have to know what to order from there. The pizza and calzones are awesome!!!!!!"
4,"Always a treat. The only thing that I can complain about is how crowded it is, but hey that just means its good! We always get their pizza rolls with ham in them. They taste amazing and make amazing leftovers too. They alone are enough to make a meal. I've also had their pasta which tasted very good. I do wish they would make it a bit brighter in here, though."
4,I have been bringing my pet here for 10 years.They know me and my dog by name. They have always taken time to answer even the silliest questions I have. I cannot even begin to calculate the amount of money the wellness plan saves me for healthcare for my dog. They have a caring staff and provide great quality care. I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else
3,"When you're a thyroid and kidney patient, you get the joy of visiting Los Vampires at Sonora Quest rather frequently. Oh no, I'm not afraid of needles. Just sick of catching crap from friends, family and co-workers for walking around looking like an intravenous drug user . . . \n\nI've been both right when the place opens at 7AM, and after work (4PM). You can either walk in, or book an appointment online. Highly recommend just making an appointment, because while you can just show up, prepare for a major wait. Appointments I've made are almost always on time. \n\nSyed is awesome. Never a bruise or a goose egg when my appointments are with him! :)"
0,"DON'T BRING CHILDREN TO THIS LOCATION!!! I brought my very nervous six-year old daughter here. She even told the phlebotomist she was scared, but there were no words of reassurance from the staff. The phlebotomist didn't really say much to us at all except to ask if my daughter would like to sit on my lap, which she said \""no.\"" As soon as the needle was inserted, my daughter jerked back, and blood was everywhere. My daughter was hysterically sobbing as I was then reprimanded by phlebotomist for not having her sit on my lap. (I wouldn't have minded doing that, but she made it sound optional rather than critical when she asked earlier. If she had warned me this might happen, I would have gladly sat with her.) Again, there were no words to calm my daughter down or even a \""sorry.\"" She asked if we wanted to draw the sample on the other arm since we had collected no blood at this point. Meanwhile, my daughter is so hysterical there was no way I could have her work on the other arm. The phlebotomist made me feel like I was in the way and should get moving out of the office if I wasn't going to do the other arm. My daughter hyperventilated practically the whole 15 minute drive home, crying that she never wants to get blood taken ever again. In my opinion, the staff should be coached and trained on how to handle nervous children or even calm down someone who is upset. I felt like I had no empathy at all, and now I have to worry about my daughter having permanent phobias with needles. I'm never coming here again!"
4,"A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!"
2,"Good Pizza,Calzones nothing exceptional.Shopping center wine bar."
1,"I would like to say first that the place has good service and I know they are trying hard to create unique flavors in a strange location. Which is mildly being factored but, I have to be real and with giving a less than positive review I will give feedback that will improve it next time. \nAccording to YELP 3 stars means \""Yah I am a fan\"" and I could not give them that 3\nI came here with a couple friends and let a non foodie friend suggest this place because it was his Bday and he heard from friends it was good... \nWe ordered :\n$8 ish Sweet Potato Fries with Duck Confit- This was one of the things that I kinda liked even thought the duck was dry and was presented as an almost\"" pulled pork style\"" What really could of improved this would of been some type of dip of sauce to go with it. Something that might reflect a confit glaze with texture. \n\n$10 Bacon Dates- This is something that if you are going to serve Tapas style that you do right because it is standard on any Tapas menu. The bacon was soggy and falling off and the dates were really hardly stuffed. CRISPY BACON is is critical though for this dish. \n\n$12 Prosciutto and Melon- UGH it should been a red flag when they misspell it on the menu and when you ask the waiter all he can say is that people come here just for the dish but doesn't have any personal opinion. So on paper it sounds like an interesting dish and it could be possible delivered but, it is difficult to do. The dish here is served with bug chunk of melon of small prosciutto slices on top with Saba drizzled and feta scattered on the plate with a poached egg. All the ingredients I love but, if this was \""Chopped\"" the judges would say that you just threw them all on the plate without really combining into flavor. The melon was too big and sweet with the minimal prosciutto and the saba/feta was more on the plate than on the dish while the egg just was hard to use for anything except by itself. How can you fix this??\n1. longer thinner melon slices turn it more into a vessel while being able to add the prosciutto as true layer of same size.\n2. I would try a qual egg which would fit perfectly\n3. then drizzle the saba directly with a sprinkle of feta and it is all on their like a great umami finger food. \n\n$9 or $10- Pork Belly Mac and Cheese- The worst thing here by far and this really can be categorized as BAD overall! Alfredo noodles, runny Alfredo Sauce, under fried pork belly and cheese on top then bake it BOOM Mac and cheese!! Oh man I can't believe this actually made it to a menu without some type of vetting. It really was not mac and cheese because all the cheese was a sauce on the bottom of part of the baked cheese on top. The pork belly was cut really small and was just fatty and mushy without any real crisping or frying. This idea is good but, actually put work into it! Make a sauce with the noodles already in it. \n\n$18 Alfredo Pizza- Sausage, Spinach, Sun dried tomatoes and Alfredo sauce- Super cheesy if you like think really creamy cheesy flavor which is super 1 note. Could use more spice but, this is exactly what you order is what you got. So, I can't say to change it however the crust is not very crispy and hard to eat with hands. I had to knife and fork it. \n\nSo overall I am not saying don't go here, food choices in Chandler are fairly limited and I assume if you are really into wine you can ignore my review since this is food related. I am just saying the food needs major improvement and the prices are set for something much more high end than what you are getting."
0,"Their computer is down today, every one was checked in manually upon arrival. As it turned out they failed to check me in and you guessed it, when I brought it to their attention when they started taking customers who checked in after me for haircuts they then checked me in, back of the line. \n\nI asked if I had to wait at the end of the list or was I next. The lady said I was next...not even an apology....BAD!!!\n\nYou guessed it, someone else was called and my feet walked out of their store with my cash.  \n\nI won't be back...ever!!!\n\nYou gotta be kidding!!!"
3,"Mmmmm, I love Pita Jungle!  I have been frequenting this restaurant back when there was just the one on Apache and you ordered at the counter.  I live near this location on Dobson and Ray, so this has now become my place to go and get hummus and a chicken shwarma.   Since I've been coming here I pretty much only get those two items, knowing that they will be tasty and delicious.  I always order a large hummus and a couple of extra pitas and then box up the rest to eat later.  I gave 4 stars simply because the service can be hit-or-miss.  For example, I have received my food order- had it dropped off at the table and the person turn and leave- while I still have no plate or silverware.  Then I find myself waiting to find someone to ask for a plate and silverware.  Otherwise, start with a hummus and pick something else off the menu...you can't go wrong!  Just make sure you get a plate and silverware before your food!"
3,"This location is my favorite one. \nSettled on a lake with an inviting patio, this is the perfect ambiance for a date or relaxing meal with friends. \nLocal art work adorn the walls and the atmosphere is pleasant. \nStart with the Hummus trio ( it's not listed on the menu but it's a plate with each hummus on it so you can experience every one) The cilantro Jalape\u00f1o hummus is heavily addictive. In fact, I'm gettin hot and bothered talking about it so... I digress.  \nThe Greek salad is super yummy to start with, and the wraps are heavenly. Lavosh Shawarma wrap is a customer favorite and the California beach club *with chicken* instead of turkey is super fresh and chalk-o-block full of goodness. If you wanna keep it more traditional, the Beef Gyro is even more delicious when accompanied by Sriracha sauce.\n \nI go here all the time and love this place more and more with every visit. Eat well, live well and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers"
2,"This place is alright, but I've gone twice and had inconsistent experiences.   The first time everything was fresh and tasty.  The second time, things weren't right and somethings were terrible.\n\nI've tried several varieties of the hummus and they're all good.\nThe mediterranean plate is very good, except for the falafel which resemble hockey pucks.\nThe spicy chicken pita wrap was alright.  It wasn't very spicy.  It was enormous and couldn't be eaten by picking it up (structural integrity problems). The chicken was all on one half of the pita wrap.  \nThe fish was terrible, definitely not a recommend. \nThe spicy chicken hummus plate was good.\nThe black bean burger was great.\nThe kafta burger was great. \nThe chipotle black bean burger was not good -- mushy and the cranberries were weird.\n\nI would normally give this a 2 star rating, but because it is one of the best fresh and healthy restaurants in the Phoenix area, I'll bump it up to a 3 star."
3,Everytime I order here or stop in and eat it's been great food. The only thing is the service there is really hit and miss so ill give a 4 overall. 5 on food and 3 on service
2,"So I am reviewing this place in hope that the business reads this and improves because they have delicious food and a lot of potential. The location is great it is very cool and inviting inside and overlooks a lake so thats always nice. They have a cool looking bar and interesting artwork. I tried 3 different plates so far and all were delicious they tasted fresh and were very flavorful. The only thing i recommend is not having their \""teas\"". These are just water with some food coloring and absolutely no flavor!! (Very disappointing). The only reason this place is getting three stars is because the service was pretty bad. No one ever greets you here they just kind of look at you like they wish you were not there and then seat you like they are doing you a huge favor.  On my recent visit our server was very uninterested in serving. She seemed irritated when we were not ready to order and then retaliated by ignoring us for the next ten minutes or so. She kept walking by us and pretending not to see us so I finally called out to her and she just put her hand up and said \""give me a couple minutes!\"" I do my very best not to piss off people who are handling my food so I just waited. She never apologized for taking so long and did not check up on us except to refill my nasty tea which she spilled and did not clean up :o \nI think I might go again because the food is so good but it would be really great if I were welcomed by a friendly staff and treated as a customer not as though I'm asking for favors. Please train your staff to be polite and friendly or just get rid of the bad seeds and this restaurant will do so much better"
4,"I had a BBQ Beef Sandwich at Chase's Diner today. Good food as well as good fries. This is one of those 50's style diners that's fun to eat at. I also like the sign I read when eating there that stated,\nAll Unattended Children Will Be Given an Espresso and a New Puppy. \nHilarious."
4,"Been coming here for years. I love love love this place!! Their 'The Works' skillet is amazing and so is their French Toast. It's made with a delightful custard batter that can put a smile on anyone's face. To be frank, all of their food is great. The service is stellar too!! You see a lot of the same people. During the week, they have a great breakfast special. There is no reason to come eat here!!"
1,We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.
1,"The food is fine - it's bagels for crying out loud! The problem here is two-fold: 1) the layout of the place is bad, causing you to queue in the dining area and then wait for your food while you're in the way of customers coming in, going out or getting beverages; 2) as others state - the service is horrible!\n\nConvenient but poor service."
0,"I am trying to like Black Angus because I love steak and their sweet potato fries are delicious - when dining in... but every single to go order I've placed in the past year and a half has been a failure. I would give them 0 stars if I could.\n\n1. Their steak is either overcooked (one time it was burnt!!!) or way undercooked. Last week I ordered a medium and a medium rare and they both came rare!!! \n2. Their fillet mignion is nothing but cartilage and fat... I guess that's what I get for ordering their $15 fillet mignion special... I can't believe they even have the gutts to call it steak!!! \n3. If you order sweet potato fries as part of your to go order, more often than not you will get their left overs - burnt, bits and pieces of sweet potatoes. Unacceptable!\n4. Their lobster is like rubber.\n5. Several times they did not add bread to my order because they ran out... how about trying to make it up to me? Isn't complimentary bread included in the overall cost of the food?!\n6. Stay away from their side caesar salad! It's whilted. \n\nI would never place a to go order with Black Angus - they take advantage of the fact that you can't check what they pack up for you and then charge you up for premium steak dinner! Save your money and go to The Keg or Firebird's. They are a little pricier but the food is top notch. Given that my to go experience with Black Angus has been so disappointing, I will definitely not dine in there again either. Their dining experience has not been much better in terms of food quality, and the last time we went there we were left standing for 10 minutes before anyone even ackowledged us."
0,My daughter went here and ordered the sampler platter and is highly allergic to shrimp she asked to subsitute it for something else and they said no.  They could put it on the side.  I called the manager and they said it is not cost effective for them to do this.  I called corporate and they said they do not do substitutions and they have no way to ensure there is no cross contamination with products people are allergic to.  This is a scary thought.  I work in a restaurant and there is away to do it.  Please if you have allergies or medical issues and you are not able to have certain items do NOT go to any Black Angus.  This is there company policy.
0,Went for lunch. Wife order Cobb salad. I order prime rib open face sandwich. Slow but food finally came. Wife looked salad and said no eggs or avocados  waiter said they were out. I could not cut prime rib with steak knife  did bring another. Worse than first. Left hungry
2,Had prime rib and King crab legs.  Loved the prime rib.  Crab want bad I enjoyed it. On the fishy side.  So just avg.  Tough to eat s meal like tjat with water. Wish the had coke.  The gf sent back her bland sirlon and ended up with very fatty Ribeye. She said my prime rib tasted great just kind of salty. I admit I can like a little salt.   Salad was great cold plate and cold fork.  I'm gonna have to give these guys another try. I enjoyed it.
1,"A little concerning when there's only a few cars in the parking lot, this should have been my first red flag. Server was nice enough,  place was clean (since that's really all there was to do with 3 tables of people). My boyfriend ordered the prime rib with crab legs, he was happy with his order. Personally,  I thought his prime rib was a little salty. I ordered a sirloin that looked almost boiled,  but was not seasoned and tasted beefy.  Our Server was nice and exchanged it for a rib eye. It looked soooo much better but again beefy tasting, and SUPER fatty. Very disappointing!  The manager came over again, I explained that although this was better it's still not great because it's really fatty and beefy in flavor, he apologized and said he would adjust the bill. When we got the bill, he took 15% off and went back to the bar he was sitting at when we walked in. I will not be coming back, absolutely lost a customer."
4,"The service and food is nothing but top notch.  I am fortunate to live close by.  Matt runs a tight ship.  If you want quality food with a friendly face, this is the place to go.  The bar staff is the friendliest that I have ever met.  Servers remember your name and what you like.  I don't have enough great things to say about Paulino.  If anyone knows how to finesse a quality cut, it is him.  Be certain to pop in at the bar and say hi to Ryan and Jordan.  They are down to earth great people.  Love the food here.  The Keg or anyone around has nothing on the meat.  And be certain to come in for Prime Rib Wednesday."
3,"I cannot believe this.  I lived in Chandler for eleven years and never discovered this place until I moved to Tempe for college.  Either way, it's a blessing to the earth.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)\n\n+ Coffee is fresh and never burnt.  I drink lots and lots of this drug, I know what's up.\n\n-/+ Lots of places to sit, but I just can't get comfortable.  It's too bright inside and the music outside is usually too loud.  However...\n\n+ The joint is located on a lake (man-made of course) and it's beautiful.  Once a friend and I passed on the tables and just sat on the edge of the water. Despite the dead fish smell, which wasn't harsh, it was fantastic.\n\n+ The employees always ask how you are doing.  They are quick to make drinks and never get distracted.\n\n+ Prices are below average.  There are a few items that are a tad overpriced, but in a nutshell this is the place to get an inexpensive good time.\n\n+  PUNCH CARD!! As some of you know, I really like punch cards.  Coffee Rush has them.  Get one."
4,"My fav coffee place! Any/all of the frost or iced drinks are super good. I've had some hot drinks, and they're surprisingly good too, especially since i'm not much of a hot coffee drinker. I usually get the black & white mocha frost, it's the best! The baristas & owners are all super friendly! When i got my tonsils taken out, they even offered me complimentary drinks:) The wifi isnt bad either ! it's always a relaxing place to get some homework done or just hangout with friends."
2,"The people seem to know how to make coffee, but that's it. I tried to have a conversation with the guy, who claims to be Turkish about Middle Eastern cultural and how diverse it was and he said, \""the Middle East really isn't that diverse.\"" Uh-huh and that's why there's so many problems between Sunnis and Shiites right?\n\nThat aside, they have taken call ahead orders, usually make a good cup of coffee and serving sizes are the standard. A bit pricey, but they do have a frequent buyer card that sort-of masks the Starbucks-esque pricing of the place. I was put off by the chauvinistic reviews that others had posted and the ignorance of the people for all things not coffee.\n\nWhen I asked where they get the Baklaava, the answer was Ali Baaba, which is a wholesale food distributor in the valley. You could buy it yourself for a fraction of the price."
4,"The owners of these 3 locations really get it. I mean really get it : I have had the pleasure of being served their hot and delicious coffee by Stefano, Zach, Kelsea, Adam, Lauren, Booz, Coco and the awesome Devon at their Ray and Elliott locations daily for the last 3 weeks. This is a happy and fun bunch that is enjoying this and doing a fantastic job. Very proactive, counters are always stocked and clean. I believe I might be re gifting my gift card from the other NW coffee co."
4,"Si Seor is the best Mexican food Chandler has to offer, from what I've tried.  The vegetarian combination is the best!  They offer quite a few combination platters to choose from, or you can get a plate of just your favorites.  I bring all of my out-of-town visitors to this restaurant, pushing the sangria and combinations to all who dine with me.  Their horchata is also quite tasty, and it's a nice compliment to the dishes with the red sauce.  The sopapilla is a perfect ending, and I'm happy to report that they also include them with take-out orders.  Very good value for your money!"
2,"Very good chips and salsa delivered to start the meal.  2 salsas, a bean dip, and a jalapeno ranch dip  -  and the chips are above decent.  The second batch of chips and salsa will cost you $2.95, however.\n\nBut the menu prices are a little high.  Spent $26 on 1 Appetizer, 1 Entree', and two drinks.  Nothing we had was outstanding, compared to other local places.\n\nI'd go back just to make a meal from 2 batches of the chips and salsa, drink water, and get out of there for under $5."
2,"Food was okay, my rice was good but my flautas were super greasy and not very flavorful... The best thing about the experience was probably the bean dip and chips. But I've still had better"
3,"Great food, really like the green chile burger. ( I know, I order a burger from a Mexican food place, but it's awesome) Also, they bring sopapilla's (sic?) after your meal which are delicious. Service has a tendency to be slow, never got refills, but otherwise a good place to get your grub on."
0,"I read a few negative reviews from other unhappy customers but I thought I would try this place out anyway. When I arrived my wife and I met Alladin, shop owner, who seemed very confident. He said he worked with pro athletes and sounded like he knew what he was talking about. He tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money. Later I purchased an $800 Hugo Boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered. He made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered. A week later I came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit (good thing I checked). He didn't ask me to try the right one on so I asked if I could make sure it fit. Long story short, he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off. He tried to charge $200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam. He finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments. He didn't know how to work with the modern Hugo Boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs . WHAT A JOKE! I was going to seek legal advice but figured I would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work. If you need anything complicated done or if you are have anything of value do not use this guy! PLEASE BEWARE and don't ignore these complaints like I did. There are other negative reviews out there if you look."
4,"I don't wear suits often, so I totally appreciated their advise on what will make me look my best.  Extremely professional, and they really know their stuff.  After they showed me the tailoring that needed to be done, I could really see how a good suit is supposed to look.  This place rocks.  If I had to do it all over again, I would visit the Tailor BEFORE even going out to buy a suit.  He helps you know what to look for in a suit."
0,Extremely poor customer service - the owner lied to me when I came to pick up my clothing and it wasn't ready. That was after calling the night before and getting attitude for inquiring before he originally said it would be ready. There's nothing special about this place.
2,"They serve the simple \""street\"" style tacos I like. I had one al pastor and one asada. Both tacos were tasty. The al pastor had a nice spice to it. I also had a green tamale that was really gross. All masa and barely any cheese or green chile they said was suppose to come in it. Can't seem to find a spot with good tamales around here. I also got a jamaica to drink and wished I had gotten the horchata that I initially wanted instead. It was watered down and sour without the sweet.  So basically... come here for the tacos... don't bother with anything else. \n\n*Note: I didn't receive this as I ordered take out, but there was a sign that said \""free chips and salsa for dine in customers\""."
2,"I really wanted horchata, so when my boyfriend and I were driving around for lunch, I searched on Yelp for a Mexican restaurant and decided on this place. The man behind the counter was nice and just said to let him know when I was ready to order, since I was still waiting for my bf to come inside. I decided on the chicken enchiladas and horchata, and my bf got a burrito. The chips and salsa they brought out before were tasty, and my horchata was good was well (free refills if you get a large!). My enchiladas were okay, but my boyfriend devoured his burrito and said it was really good, so I guess I'll have to try that next time."
1,"The tacos here are street style, which means that they are muy tiny.  I have been here around 4 or 5 times and they are always overloaded with cilantro.  Customer service is very good however."
3,"I was very lucky today as I walked in their lunch special was \""MOLE\"" oh my!  I love this stuff.. it was $5.99 w/ the delicious side of beans and rice, perfect serving size w/ a warm toritlla... I loved it - I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years... pretty descent... they are def more traditional than americanized..."
1,"I came to check this place out because it had four stars on yelp and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican food. I ordered the green chili plate and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and we shared the menudo. I was expecting the food taste more authentic but when we got our food, it was bland and not very tasteful. We felt like we could have just gone to Filerberto and got better food. The only thing good about this place was our food came out fast and the person who took our order was nice. Other then that, I will not be coming back to eat here. We left very unsatisfied!"
3,"I really like the convenience of drive thru Starbucks, but this one has a traditional vibe that makes me want to get out of my car. They are friendly and always get my drink right."
0,"I came here for dimsum with a few friends during lunch. The quality of the food is mediocre compared the legit ones in Hacienta Heights, CA or San Gabriel, CA. My friend and I are hardcore dimsum fans, so we have been to this dimsum a few times, until we decided to change to the one across the street called Phoenix Palace Buffet. \n\nFor some reason, we returned back to C-Fu to try it again, but the service was horrible!! We requested water and tea, and in my water cup and all around it were white residue from a previous mixed drink of another customer. I had already drank half of the iced water and realized there was all over the sides of the cup. I immediately asked for a replacement and even the server was grossed out! They did not do anything to compensate for such a gross encounter, which in the end made everyone at the table lose our appetites. Seriously... traumatized. Definitely not coming back until their service improves!"
3,"Great coffee and snack selection.  They are friendly and efficient.  I usually end up here more than I expect because Einstein Bagels next door tends to let me down, so I walk right over here and they consistently great."
4,"I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.  \n\nThe fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.  \n\nThey have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!\n\nEnjoy"
4,"Hands down... I love this place. They  have everything! Lots and lots of variety from imported goodness to the freshest produce. A chef's dream? yes, I believe so. \nI can always find what I need here."
1,"I am shock! \n\nToday I bought \""Monica - Lapis Surabaya's\"" cake. The code is 751160. I sliced it at home and I found the moldy inside. You can't tell without you slice it. I ate 3 slices before I knew about the moldy, I hope I am OK..Lol.. \n\nPoor me! I should checked the expired date before I bought it (I should not forget again next time...LOL). It turned out that there's no expired date printed on the box. \n\nStill, I would like to go back to this place for fresh vegetables, meats, and anything else (as long there's expired date print on it...Lol)."
0,"The smell of this place is very strong ( in a bad way )  when you step foot in it. \nI understand they have alot of items you may not find in a traditional store, but I dont care. I couldnt get past the front of the store to check it out. I respect that the seafood and other items are supposed to be \""fresh\"" but I amot the first person to have this feeling about the place. I go to other stores that are international stores , carry meats and seafoods and they dont smell anything like this."
3,"yes it smells but when I've been here I just imagine traveling to all the countries, ,depths and dark places to get all the things they have here."
1,"They have the widest selection of imported ethnic foods in the east valley. Having lived as a child near Chinatown I know what good Chinese groceries are, this one is not. They should be reasonably priced with imports on the pricey end. They all smell like fish, I don't think you get away from the smell.\n\nThe produce is hit or miss here. Last week when I went there weren't any carrots and the cauliflower had mold on it, EVERY single head I saw, and I looked at most of them. Also sometimes they will move things and you are at a loss as to how to find them.\n\nI keep going back because there are things I just don't know how to find elsewhere and I grew up with a Japanese stepfather and ethnic food. I don't want to have to try to find places to order things from online or go to ten different stores to find quality.\n\nAlso prices are not competitive, they know they are the largest in the east valley and they know that they can change what they want to. Its frustrating. I avoid this store unless I need something specific. (so I go once or twice a year) \n\nIt probably has what your looking for is the BEST thing I can say for this place."
4,international az
1,"I've been going to Lee Lee's for a number of years, but it seems to be in a decline over the last year. While the selection and stock of some ethnic sections are still maintained, the Japanese foods aisle is not being stocked regularly. Lee Lee's has never had an outstanding Japanese food section, but it had most of the essentials. Being of Japanese descent, this section was a lifesaver for me-but no more. Instead of the familiar brands and selection of Japanese goods a ten-foot section of shelves was being fronted with CostCo (Kirkland) roasted seaweed. While I do buy seaweed from CostCo occasionally, when I'm having some good rice I look for the slightly thicker and more flavorful Japanese brands. Even their rice section was decimated and lacked stock. I guess I'll look for a new market."
1,"again, if it sounds too good to be true, (all you can eat sushi) then it's probably too good to be true (AYCE sushi).\n\nso some of you are probably saying, \""....he just ate at another AYCE sushi place and was so disappointed, fool you once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me\"".  we've been living in chandler for 3.5 yrs and we've never even heard of this place.\n\nlesson learned:  never eat at a sushi place that doesn't come with high recommendations from people you have eaten with and trust their palates.\n\nthere's a semi-rational reason that other places charge $8-$13 a roll.  if they charge you that much and the sushi is sucky, then you would be the one making a scene at the cash register.\n\nwhat's the deal w/japanese food being inherently expensive?  they sell us great cars and really do it to us on the food.  show me a japanese restaurant where you can get out the door for less than $15/head and i'll show you kyoto bowl (see review)\n\nfor half the price, you can get twice as much food at an authentic chinese restaurant and have a ton of leftovers.  but i guess you can't get chinese cooks to cook it in front of you while catching shrimp in their hats.\n\ngo figure\n\ni was amazed that when we went there on a friday night, the place was standing room only (but we were the only people of asian persuasian)    .  i get the impression that the staff is trying to save money (more tips for the 2 waitresses?) because they seemed to be falling all over each other like keystone cops, wizzing past our tables and avoiding eye contact whenever we needed an extra pair of chopstix, napkins or water refills.\n\nam i being the the overly cautious 1st time parent or what?  the waitress brings out the scalding hot soup and passes it right over the head of our 1 y/o daughter sitting in her high chair and plops it down within arms reach of her.  we quickly move it to the adult who ordered it (brilliant).\n\nwe were sitting with my friend's 20 or so family members and requested a separate check to ease the confusion.  she stuttered and stammered and said that she was not allowed to do that and that we would have to be on the same check (i guess we had to sit at a separate table to get a separate tab?)  i could see how 18 on 1 tab and 2 on another would be confusing.\n\nmy wife ordered the tempura soba noodle soup and said that it was so salty that her tongue is now preserved for life.  i ordered the chicken katsu which was decent, but the sauce was almost like biscuits and gravy style sauce.\n\nif you're on a budget and just wanna stuff your face with low-grade sushi and walk away full, then this is the place.  if you want quality, great tasting sushi, then you'll have to pay the piper.\n\nyou have been forewarned"
2,"Even though it was fun to watch the food prepared, I felt the food was overly salty.  The chef told us what the spices were before he started cooking, but since the food for the entire table was cooked together, there was no way  that I could stop him from using so much salt. The food was well cooked and would have been tasty, if it had not tasted so much like salt. \n\nWe did not try the sushi, even though that was our original intent, because the Teppanyaki was so tempting, but priced us out of the moderate range.  ($51 for two entrees and one saki bomb)   \n\nAlso is it really necessary to charge an extra $3 to have fried rice instead of white.   \n\nit's fun to watch the chefs cook, so entertainment is a good reason to go. The serving size was good, not huge, but filling.  If you eat teppanyaki it is served at a grill, with other people so privacy/intimacy is not an option.  The staff was pleasant but  not what I would call  friendly. \n\nI'm glad we tried it, and maybe we will go back and try the sushi, but I won't return for the teppanyaki."
3,"Normally I eat sushi on the sushi side. Tonight I dined teppanyaki. Very flavorful chicken and crisp veggies. \nShrimp were ok.\n\nThe show was ok, but not as good as bigger city restaurants. \nVery basic. \nBut if it is your first teppanyaki visit, it will seem outstanding.\n\nUsed a groupon special which saved quite a bit, only complaint. If you plan on buying alcohol buy the higher priced groupon. It will save you way more in the long run. \nAll In all still a great place to dine."
1,"Not a fan.\n\nWent here upon my sister's recommendation but she also said she hadn't been there in about 10 years. So I chanced it because I live really close.\n\nWe sit down and the first question our server asks us rather abruptly is, do you have a Groupon? I was like, uh no. Is there a Groupon? So I look on my phone and sure enough there was so I bought one -$19 for $30.\n\nI was not impressed with the food at all. Every roll had cream cheese and krab mix in it or some variation of that. So not a great selection. Wasn't especially fresh and definitely flavorless. And the rice to fish ratio in the rolls was way off. They were like all rice no fish.\n\nOn top of that, our food took forever. Sigh.\n\nNot a great value. Without the groupon our bill would have been close to $60 for some mediocre sushi.\n\nSo I guess a lot of people come here for their $20 all you can eat special. We decided not to because of all the rules and conditions. No sharing. If you don't eat it all, you pay for what you don't eat...seriously?\n\nOne bright spot was the service was pretty good.\n\nOverall, won't be back :/"
2,We did take out.  Chichen beef and shrimp with veggies was very good.  Salad we threw out which was iceberg lettuce with a dab of some sweet Asian salsa type stuff.  Fried rice was extra cost.  2 people came to 30+ bucks - 15 a plate is too much for takeout.
1,"WTF... half an hour total to get a color match paint in an empty store?  Even my friend got testy with the whole experience (that says alot when a completely uninvolved person is annoyed).  The lady brings the can to the back area, and I hear her chatting away forever, until I start haunting the employee area does the can actually get to me.  And then she forgot to tell them the original formula was 125% strength, which I'm trying to figure out if she did it right.  She snatches the can from me just as I'm trying to validate the old vs new label, and I don't see her again for 10 min... and she never comes back out to tell me if the formula was right or wrong.  I'm just left hanging around w/ no other avail employee (someone else actually walked in)  to at least ask pls followup w/ the lady in the back, who I can still hear chatting away w/ the paint matcher guy.  Seriously poor customer service.  Worst part, they did not mix a new can of paint... just squirted in 25% more tint and slapped another label on the can...chinzy and it was her error.\n\nI went to Dunn Edwards (vs my standby) cuz I needed to color match what the original home owner's used, but no screw top lid + poor customer service = not coming back when I'm applying new paint."
3,"Its like a Jamba Juice but with heart.   The owners are very friendly and as I always say we must support our local business's!  The wheatgrass here was clean, fresh and delicious ( well as good as wheatgrass can be) I also had a juice but none of the food... yet.  The juice was fantastic!  You can tell they really fine tuned their recipies and made something you cant make on your own.  That being said if the food is as good as that juice (which btw gave me CRAZY energy) i will be raising this to 5 stars.  The menu for food looked great, huge selection, no bland sandwiches but i was im a hurry so i didnt have sandwich time :( NEXT TIME 4 sure"
3,"Paradise Juice is a daily ritual when we're staying in Paradise Valley.  The freshly-made juices on the menu are great but PJ comes into it's own when you customize the standards.\n\nI love Kale, and getting a Green Juice made of primarily Kale instead of the basic offering of cucumber was no problem.\n\nIt's not the cheapest juice bar in town but you get what you pay for; Paradise Juice is worth every penny!"
0,"This was a very sad experience. We went on a Sunday night at about 7pm. The place was empty. It took some time to seat us. Tea took forever. Bread took forever. After 35 minutes waiting for simple food my dear wife got pissed and we left. Because I have honor, I wanted to pay for the tea on the way out. Even that took forever. I hoped that for the prices they charge and the fact that the place was empty that the service would be good. All I learned is why the place was empty. We then went to Cheddars next door and had a nice meal."
0,"WORST color &  cut job ive ever had! The color was spotchy, faded into a goldish color the very next week & the cut was un-even. I ended up having to go to someone else to fix her horrible attempt at  \""high lights\"" !!!! The minute you sit down she is rushing you out of the door & she didnt even blow dry my hair all the way! DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR HAIR!!!"
1,"Let me start with the good.  Their fish seemed fresh, and they have some interesting, well conceived rolls.  Their Scallop Nigiri was fantastic, fresh, and delicious.\n\nOutside of the scallops, their food was 'Meh'.  Had Yakisoba, and several rolls; did not try any of their sashimi, because it seemed really expensive (4 pc. Sake Sashimi for $9).  We quickly realized why the rolls were cheaper: because there isn't much fish in them.  The fish on the rainbow roll we got  was sliced so thin, it was hard to tell how quality the fish was.  The rice to fish ratio was ridiculous, leaving with me mostly full, but unsatisfied.\n\nWe were warned before ordering that they were pretty busy, and we should put our sushi order in quickly.  While I appreciate the warning, I don't think AN HOUR AND A HALF is an acceptable waiting time with or without warning.  The Yakisoba we ordered came out promptly, but after finishing it, we waited another full hour for the sushi.\n\nOverall I feel they are overpriced for what you get, and the food is not exactly worth the wait.  Not bad by any means, but not worth dealing with the price/service."
4,"Sushi is first rate, the fish is so fresh! Loved the albacore,  tried beef toungue, DELICIOUS! Must come back and try the hot dishes.... Hard to find real Japanese food, so glad we found this!"
2,"I have a couple of complaints:\n\n1.  They were out of oysters on the day I went, and I really stopped in exclusively to have them.\n2.  The prices on the \""Happy Hour\"" menu on their website are incorrect.  I paid $6.50 instead of the listed $5.50 for my chicken.\n\nThe only item I tried was 4.5-star-worthy, and that was the \""Japanese Fried Chicken.\""  Lightly breaded and yummily juicy white meat. Very tasty.  Small portion for $7.09 though - only about 7 or 8 small bite-sized pieces.\n\nThe taste made me wish even more that they had not been out of oysters.\n\nBut as others have noted, the \""price to value\"" equation here is on the pricey side.\n\nP.S. It has been pointed out to me by a helpful Yelper that oysters are \""not in season\"" in August, and that's why they were not serving them.  That's fine, but I would say to a restaurant owner that if you have something on your menu that is available only in certain months, then you should say that on the menu.  *oysters available only in etc etc etc.  That way, people won't drive over there to get something which is out of season."
4,Al does some seriously good fish - get ya sum!!!
2,"I'm going to revise my original post after going on the maricopa.gov restaurant inspection list. It appears Shimogamo has a few citations for not keeping their fish at the appropriate temperature of below 41 degrees. In fact, these citations say it was up to 54 degrees.\n\nAs someone who checks the Maricopa.gov site regularly on these restaurant checks, I  know that there are some citations that are really stupid (for example - they got cited for not putting the \""consuming raw fish etc is bad for your health\"". Duh, it's a sushi restaurant. But, raw fish storage to me is important, since that's how many people get sick from sushi restaurants. As much as I liked this place, I am going to hold off a couple months until the next inspection to make sure this isn't re-occuring ."
2,"Great slides for the three year old; haven't had a service issue, beyond typical fast food worker apathy.\nOil needs to be chaned in the fryer. :-P"
1,"Okay now this is a large chain and on average it's okay to good!  and I have been to this place many, many times, but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings (they were dry, over cooked) then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo (Cajun) something but after my second brew I thought it was me, so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty!!!!  It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened \""because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made\"" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness..."
2,"I ate here the day before yesterday with my son and my grandmother. We were the first patrons for the day. My son had the mini cheeseburgers with french fries and my grandmother and I ordered the same dish. Sirloin steak (medium rare) with shrimp, garlic mashed potato's and a side of broccoli. I've decided that I'm going to do a celebrity style point review for this one-enjoy.\n\nWaiter was nice and gave us a lot of attention. (+10points)\nStrangely, he never once offered to refill our drinks. (- A gagillon points!!!!! Just kidding. -8points)\nOur food came out very quickly. (+7points)\nOur steaks came out medium well not medium rare-like we ordered. (-11points)\nEverything else on the dish was delicious and flavorful especially the broccoli. (+15 points) **I'm not kidding here the side dishes were excellent I was taken aback by the balance of garlic and other spices in my food. I was bummed I didn't have one of those \""my God!\"" portioned sized plates...mmm, okay, onward. \nThe dishes were reasonably priced (+8points)\nMy entire entree was under 550 calories which I guess, is good. (+3points)\n\nI would definitely eat here again, but from what I've read I'm not the first person to experience meat not cooked to what was specified. It would seem all the cooks at this location understand is kinda done and really done. Which, for me, means that I won't go here for steak but I will enjoy Vegetarian dishes or seafood. Also, if you do stop by try the raspberry tea it was really delicious. Oh, and one more thing I don't care to figure out how many points that came out too, so if you want to brush up on your arithmetic...no? Okay."
1,"You get what you pay for.  Well, I got what they paid for."
2,"I am going to be the party-pooper here and say that my visit was only so-so. My brother and I both ordered here and neither of us finished our meals. Maybe... we just weren't that hungry.\n\nWith that said, maybe I just don't know good (real) Asian food when I have it in my mouth? This could be the case... or my brother and I both got bad batches. After all, we did stumble in about 15 minutes before they were closing (which generally doesn't make the cooks happy).\n\nThe owner however was super nice. Actually, absurdly nice. He had a demeanor that had us both walking out going... \""could that guy be any more calm?\"" Seriously though, I've never met someone so peaceful. \n\nSeeing as how we had never been there the owner also whipped out a little picture book with all the stuff they serve. It was nice for us two un-cultered folks.\n\nWith all this said, would I go again? Not really unless I was right there and someone else wanted to go."
3,"Found this place from yelp and had to check it out based on the great reviews. All I can say is wow! This place is super yummy! I have a new favorite! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. My only downfall was they don't accept Amex cards."
4,"The orange beef alone is good enough to earn this place 5 stars. I thought the teriyaki chicken was a little bland, but as an out of towner, i can already say my first stop off the plane next year will be for some more orange beef. Thank goodness for yelp, because the place itself is very plain, and never would've pegged it as a place that would've knocked my socks off with the first bite."
4,"I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for Tokyo House. I've been frequenting this establishment since I was weaned off my mother's nipple. All the time, people ask me: \""How'd you grow to be so tall and handsome?\"" I don't tell them that it was genetics. I tell them that it was all the good eatin' at Tokyo House.\n\nMy mom told me that when I was born my head was four times larger than my body, and because of my explosive bouts of infantile diarrhea, I wasn't able to gain weight. In layman terms, my head-to-body ratio was way out of whack, and it started creating all sorts of health problems. The doctor said that my huge head was consuming so many calories that it destroyed my immune system and put the rest of my body in a state of malnutrition. He told my poor mother that I only had two weeks before my head consumed my little limbs. Thirteen days after the doctor's diagnosis, I looked like a pink balloon on a limp string (the string being my last identifiable extremity, if you know what I mean.) My string started receding into my head like a toddler sucking up a wet spaghetti noodle. My mother thought that it was the end for me. She didn't know a better way to send me out of this cruel world than to serve me a proper last supper. She drove us to Tokyo House, ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, whispered her goodbyes to me, and stuffed my head with that magical food. \n\nI owe my life to Tokyo House. It's because of them (and the awesome Asian man at the front register) that I'm alive today."
0,"I do not believe how this place got the rating that it has. I got burnt, over cook shumai, precooked and dried out chicken.  Food is bad to go along with the unhelpful order taker.  I will not be back."
0,"I've been coming here for years and the food has always been good the prices fair and the service exceptional.  it appears there is new management, the food is bad, and I say that with all sadness.  The teriyaki sauce is watered down a lacks flavor, the Yakasoba is dry.  Very sad.  The staff is OK but not near where it used to be. too bad.  my suggestion pass on this place.  You will see that all the good reviews are old."
0,"I've been to Cyclo twice. The first time was great. The food and service was really good. Pretty reasonably priced. Really loved the fact that you could bring your own wine. Went back about a year later. Again, food was great. The garlic green beans as good as I remember. Pretty good service. The owner was there again in another cute little dress (sorry, but I notice that kind of shit). Liked the check holders had customer graffiti all over them (more dumb shit I notice). Finished the wine and meal, hit up the bathroom before leaving. Only one and it was occupied. Fine, it's a small place I understand. Wait a bit, then our spiky haired waiter comes out. He gives me a shifty look, which I didn't understand. I Immediately get it once I make my way in and look at the toilet. Didn't even put the seat up. Piss everywhere. I was so mad. Unfortunately, the bill was paid and he was tipped by the time I came out. F'n disgusting. I hate to judge the place by one waiter, but feel like if they are gonna let this ahole work here, can't help but think what else they might be letting slide.  \nSorry, won't be back."
2,"I gotta say that if you have never tried Pho, you may think this place is the end all be all. It gets 3 stars from me because of the exposure it has given Viet food in the valley.  there are much better restaurants than Cyclo, with much better value and menus."
0,"I really don't understand what the fuss is about with this place.  I had it years ago and thought it was horrible, but decided to give it a try again today with some co-workers. What a mistake!  First off, the food is horribly overpriced.  You can get a better bowl of pho at many other Vietnamese restaurants for half the price.  Taste wise, the pho was horrible.  It's all about the broth for a good bowl of pho, and it tasted like they just used beef broth from a can.  Additionally, the brisket smelled like it was spoiled.  Even my American co-worker thought the food tasted horribly.  This is the first time I have not left a tip at a restaurant.  It was that bad.  If you go to a Vietnamese restaurant and you don't see any Vietnamese people there, it should tell you something."
2,"Baby and kiddie consignment shops are an absolute treasure when one has a growing baby that needs new clothes, toys, or furniture pieces every three months.  \n\nThis particular store is ideal if you are in the market for baby bouncers, play-yards, swings, strollers, or bassinets.  The average cost is $25-$55, depending on automation, mobiles, and design.  Of course half of the store is clothing, which is well labeled and separated by month/year.  Average cost is $4-$8 for clothing items, off season pieces are generally marked down 50%.  Some select formulas are for sale as well, new and at half the price of a grocery store.\n\nStaff was knowledgable, were able to tell me over the phone that they had what I was looking for, and assisted us in putting our items in the car after our purchases.\n\nPros: Great variety of above-mentioned items, reasonably priced.\nCons:\nBaby items such as swings and bouncing cradles are very dirty.  We brought an automated swing home with us and it had to be thoroughly wiped and disinfected, as well as the liner and safety harness put through the wash.\nThe two convertible cribs that were available for sale were priced at $150, but had significant wear and tear - most of the furniture pieces here look less than sellable..."
4,"When I travel, I always try to eat as much native food as I can. Otherwise what's the point of travelling if you don't try to experience some of the local culture and cuisine. I was therefore excited to find a fine dining restaurant offering local native Indian cuisine rather than the ubiquitous tex mex of the southwest.\n\nWell, I enjoyed one of the best dining experiences of my life here, not just best native Indian dining experience.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the Wild Horse Resort complex, which is a native Indian resort offering casino & golf as well as hotel facilities. My only problem was navigating the huge complex and my only criticism was that the signposting to the hotel/restaurant was poor, something which I mentioned to the staff and received a promise that the problem had already been identified and was being dealt with. Just in case it still hasn't, head for the golf clubhouse and keep going beyond that despite the lack of signage!\n\nThere is valet parking available but self parking is no problem. The hotel itself is spacious and Kai is located on the ground floor. Kai is the Pima word for seed and there are many obvious native Indian influences, reflected in many aspects of  the design and architecture - this is all explained in the restaurant menu and is obviously an aspect of the experience that they're very rightly proud of here.\n\nThe restaurant has been recently refurbished to a very high standard. The tables are well spaced out and everything reeks of top quality - for example, the menus are printed on embossed paper.\n\nI think the way to sum up this amazing restaurant is 'attention to detail'. I've been lucky to dine in 3 Michelin star establishments but nowhere in the whole world I've visited beats Kai for attention to detail. Everyone knew my name from my reservation. Cutlery restocked from different sides of the table. New napkins for every visit to the restroom. Crockery and cutlery warmed or chilled to appropriate temperature for every dish!!\n\nThe service is also friendly and very informative. There is also great drama with the food and choreography to the service. Foie gras is bruleed at the tableside. Soups are decanted into bowls from pitchers. Multiple waiters coordinate simultaneous delivery of dishes to multiple diner tables.\n\nMy server kindly arranged a fresh orange juice. Then came another moment which sums up this amazing restaurant - I was offered fruit accompaniments with my glass of regular water!\n\nOnto the food.  I went for the tasting menu with its interesting choice of ingedients and combinations. \n\nI was pleased to see that the choice of breads included local Indian flatbread - a local Indian chief came into the kitchen to show the chefs how to make it. This was served with a first rate fruity olive oil.\n\n1. Amuse of buffalo tartare with cornbread crisp, crisp microgreens and balsamic vinegar. The buffalo was more gamey than normal beef and the balsamic vinegar was an excellent foil.\n\n2. Avocado panna cota toped with shrimp ceviche. The server poured over a papaya and mango soup at the table. My first huge smile moment when I found my chilled spoon! This was a dish which intrigued me from its unlikely combination of such disparate ingredients and it worked!! The smooth avocado was a perfect base for the tangy ceviche and the fruit soup wasn't too sweet but the subtleties of the papaya and mango were definitely evident flavours.\n\n3. For a carnivore, I was amazed at the great salad which followed -  the menu told me that the lettuces had been picked by local farmers and children of the Gila Crossing School. The salad had a chilli dressing. It was accompanied by date cake with foie gras (yum!), Humboult Fog goat cheese and heirloom tomato with candied walnut.\n\n4. Baja scallop topped with dried mango and sandalwood dust. The sandalwood gave the dish a powerful aromatic introduction, which activated all my salivary glands. An unusual use of what is usually used in incense sticks. The giant sweet scallop was served with bean puree, fried salsify and fennel pollen.\n\n5. Seared foie gras with macerated huckleberry and a fig in filo pastry. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that you can't go wrong with seared foie gras with me!\n\n6. Palate cleanser of guava with fennel sorbet and mango sauce.\n\n7. Grilled tenderloin of buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe. The meat was open and evenly textured, tender with a nice gamey flavour. The plate was completed with a chorizo and corn cake and a morel mushroom mix.\n\n8. Lamb with pecan crust with chocolate and chilli sauce. Chocoalte with chilli has become mainstream and I wonder if this is where it originated.\n\n9. Cheese. Belgian soft cheese and a Tasmanian cheddar.\n\n10. Medley of desserts. Corn creme brulee. Fig bread with chocolate ice cream inside. Italian meringue bruleed tableside with fruit.\n\nAlso lovely to chat to chef de cuisine Jack Strong after the meal."
3,"I went here awhile back after hoodwinking my dad into taking out the family there.  He won't infrequently take us out for a fancy meal when we're all together but this place goes beyond our normal haunts.\n\nI found no faults with the food whatsoever.  Everything tasted just wonderful, all proteins were expertly prepared, and the menu is also quite interesting.  The heirloom tomato tart was divine, as was the duck trio which included foie gras with a sauternes reduction, confit of leg with coffee and the breast meat with lingonberry preserves.\n\nAs great as the food was, giving this place even four stars is a stretch.  And this is due to the non-food aspects of the place.  Actually I feel a bit sorry for the chef and wish he had his own restaurant somewhere else to serve this sort of food.  Kai is annoyingly pretentious, and extremely patronizing to Native American culture.  They pretend like it's some sort of homage to the desert tribes but it's really the opposite.  I wished the waiter would shut up after giving us all these greetings in the \""native language\"" and talking about the artwork and such.  They call their fry bread \""fry bread from the teachings of the elders.\""  Is that what the elders teach?  How to destroy a culture, build a huge resort on their land and then create an exercise in Western exoticism a la early 20th century Europe?  Did the \""elders\"" eat foie gras?\n\nI wasn't impressed by the team of four waiters taking our plates away all at once.  I asked our waiter for water and he forgot so we had to remind him again--or rather my dad did, in his usual surly way.  Sometimes when one gets involved with elaborate service it's even easier to forget the most basic things.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, I would go back again (if someone else is paying).  The food is spectacular, and I can suffer a lot for great food."
0,They would not even bother calling me back about getting a quote. Had to call three times to see what the deal was. Receptionist was very nice but apparently Dennis is a bum. Can't attest to any work since I was apparently not worth calling back.
0,"This place is an absolute joke. A lot of the employees are incompetent, rude, and just plain don't care. The manager is clueless which might explain a lot of the other problems.\n\nI have never seen a store sell so much food that is way past expiration date. If you tell them it quickly becomes obvious that they do not care.\n\nBe careful if you use the bakery because apparently the \""bakers\"" don't understand that when you remove bread from the oven you are just supposed to let it cool before wrapping it, and not let it sit for hours exposed to open air. You can get \""fresh\"" bread that was just recently baked and still have it be like two day old bread! If you happen to mention that you could fracture someone's skull with the bread they are highly offended.\n\nGood luck trying to pay the actual cost of items in this store. It's amazing how many \""mistakes\"" they make in their pricing, and the \""mistakes\"" are always to their advantage. If they ring up the wrong price on an item and you show them that the price on the shelf is different, it is likely that they will tell you someone forgot to remove the old price tag. There is a LOT of forgetting in this store. You may well have a problem trying to figure out the actual price of an item given that they have so many schemes where they display a price prominently like it is the actual price, only to find that there is small print that explains all of the conditions that have to be met before you will get that price. It's quite obvious that they make a lot of money off of people buying stuff that they thought was lower in price.  As an added bonus, this store must have some of the highest prices in a grocery store anywhere. They put stuff on sale that is still much higher than normal prices at another store.\n\nWant to withdraw cash with your ATM card at the register? They offer up to $100 for your convenience. However, if you should actually try to get cash back you will likely find that you will be given all fives and the cashier will be none too happy about it. Question them on why they offer up to $100 dollar ATM withdrawals but don't have sufficient change and are unhappy about you doing so? I have had three completely different answers to this question from three different employees. Including one employee telling me that the problem doesn't exist!\n\nWaiting in a long line happens all too frequently because they have no self checkout and only one cashier most of the time.\n\nThe reviews here on this store are puzzling, to say the least. Apart from the fact that many online reviews are questionable now because of \""reviews\"" from people with ties to the business, some of the reviews seem to be based on one single visit and or incident. Saying that an employee said \""Hi\"" to you and asked you if you needed help is hardly justification for posting a good review for the store. I know of an employee at this store who was great, but sadly seems to be gone now. Even when she was there it was nowhere near enough to change our overall experience of this store. I have been to this store (as a secondary choice) extensively for years just because it is so close to where we live, but I have had enough. This review is based on a LOT of visits. People are doing consumers a disservice when they post frivolous reviews that are extremely misleading. \n\nGive this store the treatment it deserves and stay away."
3,It is Startbucks. Just like in your neighborhood.
2,"My review is based solely on t-shirt purchases. \n\nI travel between ORD and PHX alot for business and family.  This time I had a short notice business trip and felt bad I had to leave DH behind so decided to go back here and get him a present.  Whew.  When we were out here in April, I thought this was one of the highest priced HD dealers to get a shirt.  \n\nSo decided to give it a try this time.  I ended up getting two shirts and out the door I went.  I gotta say the sales chick was very nice and got me in and out but I still say this is one of the highest priced HD dealers to get a shirt.  \n\nThere is something to be said, when I get a shirt at ORD cheaper than I can get one in Chandler."
0,"These guys are a joke. Was getting an oil change and a new rear tire on my bike. Shopped around on the phone with several valley HD dealerships. Drove three hours to get there since i don't have a HD dealership in my area. Once I got there they jacked the price up and wanted 50.00 more to install the tire and 50.00 more for the oil change. Overall, they were 150.00 more expensive the the Scottsdale dealership. Met with the service adviser who gave me the quote and the service manager. Both had a \"" tough shit\"" attitude. Weren't willing to match the price or negotiate at all. Business must be great at Chandler Harley Davidson with their don't give a shit arrogant attitude. Wonder if the owners know that this is the way their management treats customers? Would not recommend going there and I know I never will again.?totally disgusted."
4,I have taken cars there 6 or so times. I have had only positive experiences with them and their rates are cheaper than most garages around. I saw reviews speaking of their misdiagnosing a problem. They actually fixed a problem for me that was misdiagnosed at another similar business in Chandler. Their staff is very nice as is their facility.
4,"Great place to shop, the bakery and coffee area is cheaper than a Starbucks and the pastries are much better. The outside patio is a nice place to read the paper in the morning.\n\nThe staff is top notch and cares about the customers compared to other markets in town. For quick meals the sushi bar is excellent, so is the salad bar, and deli selections.\n\nThere is no negative to shopping here, unless you are using it as your main supermarket, then things can get pricey."
3,"This review is for their sushi bar only. I have been going to AJ's sushi bar since 2006. At that time, the sushi chefs were awesome and I'd totally rate it four stars. Since that time they've had a lot of turn over, the hours have been cut, and generally their value for the price and the quality of the fish has gone downhill. Sadly, I will have to find a new place for my sushi take-out, as it is no longer worth the drive or the $$.\n\n2013 update: They've re-hired some of the old sushi chefs and this has returned to one of my favorite take-out sushi bars. The quality is back up with the old chefs working, and I'm happy they're back on my good side!"
3,"I recently started working in this area and discovered Aj's! I had heard rave reviews from friends but I had never been to an Aj's myself. I am very impressed. I have been stopping by every couple of days to try out the salad bar and soup options. They also have an amazing selection of craft beers that I scoped out today. I have not shopped here yet for other grocery items but it looks like they have a great selection of healthy foods and harder to find local items. \n\nThe bakery is also very nice and has a good selection of bagels, pastries, brownies and cupcakes. I ordered a green chile bagel here the other day for lunch which was delicious. The berry acai tea is also wonderful. Really I have not found anything bad about this place so far. The service has also been great on every visit. Top notch. I will be back."
3,"I'm starting to get the hang of Indian food, and as George Costanza would say: \""I'm Loving It !\"".  So when a friend suggested an Indian buffet, I was all over it.  India Gate is great, not pretentious or over the top, with a good sized menu, oh but I didn't want the menu Georgie, I wanted the buffet.\n\nIt had all of my favorites like palak paneer and matter paneer, plus some new favorites like the minced lamb and green chutney.\n\nI love their lunch buffet and stop by at least twice a month, but I was unimpressed with the lamb vindaloo entree from the menu. The lamb was tough and had gristle. Boo Gristle... Hooray Beer!"
2,"My Grandparents, myself & my uncle stayed in this hotel this past weekend. The hot breakfast every morning was great, the room was clean and roomy enough. However, I do have a few complaints. The sheets were very scratchy and not very comfortable, the bedside lamp wouldn't turn on or off without plugging it in or out of the wall. We could hear every voice outside our door of people walking up and down the hall and talking/laughing. My uncle & Grandfather's room had a broken toilet seat and it didn't get fixed until we complained a second time around 2:30pm. The front desk clerk, Nicole didn't exactly have the greatest personality either. She wasn't rude but appeared to not really know how to do her job very well. When asked for a suggestion on where to get lunch, she suggested the Firebird next to the Elephant Bar and said it was close enough to walk to. It was easily a 10-15 minute drive away at the Mall! Not in walking distance. Needless to say my 78 year old grandparents were not happy. In my opinion the rooms are not worth $149.00 a night. I've stayed in beautiful hotel rooms for a lot less than that in both Vegas and San Francisco. Chandler, AZ is hardly comparable to those cities. Just a suggestion to either upgrade your bedding, maintenance and improve the professionalism (both in appearance and knowledge) or lower your prices. FYI....there were two gentlemen who worked in the evening/night were friendly and super helpful. I wish I had gotten their names. Oh yeah and the cleaning people took my toothpaste when they cleaned and restocked the bathroom!"
3,I went to Jason's on Saturday night for the first time. I ended up with a side salad and a baked potato. I didn't think you could have a baked potato that big! The potato was huge and could have been a meal by itself. \n\nLarge selection of items to choose from. I wish there was a few more vegtables at the salad bar and had more crouton options. \n\nI will have to head back to try the sandwiches.
1,"I don't get Cold Stone.  My daughter once got the mint flavor w/ mix-in, it tasted like toothpaste, the mint flavor was so strong!\n\nThe mix-ins give ice cream w/ so-so flavor some zip, but that adds too many unnecessary calories.\n\nIf I'm gonna blow bucks on ice cream, its either a special stop to Angel Sweet where the flavors of the gelato on its own make it yummy, no need for mix-ins, or I'll pick up some Ben & Jerry's, Blue Bunny or Breyers from Fry's."
0,Ice cream was soft and not creamy like it used to be. Way over priced
2,Nice icecreams with a huge amount of alternatives. Nice place to grab an icecream when in the mall. Had the donought - one. Overall good place
2,"Foot Locker is home to the largest selection of athletic shoes in the mall but the pricing could be better.  Their inventory also includes a dozen or so Foot Locker exclusives like several Nike Air Max 95 colorways.  \n\nFoot Locker sweats, hoodies, and other athletic gear are generally durable, fit well, and priced well.  The Chandler store also places some focus on team athletic apparel and miscellaneous sports accessories.  \n\nThe sales aren't that great.  I saw a pair of Jordan CMFT's in the white/gray/black colorway selling for $80.  I bought the same pair at a Nike Outlet in New Jersey in July for $50.  What's up with that?\n\nI can't call it..."
2,"I came in to pick up a new laptop charger and get the upgrade to Lion OSX.\n\nGetting the charger was easy enough, but because I'm on Leopard and not Snow Leopard, I have to buy *two* OS upgrades to get to Lion. Ok, that's fine and all, but the stores don't carry the upgrade from Leopard to Snow Leopard. Excuse me?\n\nMy only options were to find a Best Buy that may or may not have the Leopard to Snow Leopard upgrade disc in stock, or order it online and wait several days for it to arrive. They can't keep a few discs in stock at the Apple store? Absurd.\n\nOther than that total stupidity, the location was fine, store was clean (albeit busy at an odd time), and employee that checked me out was nice enough."
3,"I'm definitely an Apple fan! Thats all I have. In order for Apple to get 5 Stars it would take them offering better prices for their products & services. I understand everyone's gotta make money but dang they charge a lot sometimes. Can't review the tech support at this location but the store is always clean & the staff is knowledgeable about the products. Its a great place to bring your children when they are riding your nerves. They will infiltrate the store & keep themselves plenty occupied playing so you can catch your sanity. lol Almost as good as IKEA, now if we can just check them in here for a bit and go hide, hahahaha!"
2,"I shopped at Dillard's 3 times recently over the holidays. I enjoyed the selection in the juniors department but the staff.... ugg. There were about 5 or 6 girls on at a time and there were all standing clumped together. All snobbing it up. I mean if I asked for help they would help but they were very dismissive, a big group of silly acting sales girls all clumped together gossiping.. makes me feel like I'm either not cool enough to shop there or they need a mommy to come tell them to break it up. On one of my visits one of the girls actually gave a high five to the girl that was checking me out because I was making two transactions in one checkout saying \""oh that;s number 7 for you way to go!\"" Maybe for the commission?? I don't know but just uggg! The lady in the women's section was great! And so was the women that helped me in the lingerie section. \n\nOverall I enjoy shopping at Dillard's but you don't need that many girls standing around gossiping and acting bored do you? 2 or 3 girls who actually take their job seriously would be great!"
2,"I go to this restaurant usually on Sunday morning because they have their awesome double stamp days. \n\nNow for the restaurant-The wait can be a little annoying especially on the weekends. But, that's expected. \n\nThe atmosphere-I usually  go to the one in Chandler off of Ray Rd. The atmosphere is very friendly and the restaurant is clean. I like the little breakfast bar they have. \n\nFood-The food is delicious and they have the perfect portions for me. However, my husband often complains that they don't give him enough food. But, this is where the cool little $1 menu comes in. They have a wide  range of things that you can add to your meal for $1. I usually add the fruit cup or mini-pancakes. I haven't had a chance to try a lot of their menu items. They have a pretty long list of items and I often get overwhelmed trying to figure out what to order. I have had the 7 Veggie Omelette. It was very tasty! What made it more enjoyable was knowing that I was eating a healthy omelette. Some of them have tons of ingredients and even one with all meat. The one thing that I have tried that I DO NOT recommend is the biscuits and gravy. I have had better. The gravy can taste a little bland and the biscuits taste chewy on the inside. \n\nServices-The service can be hit or miss. But, I do like that they give a large cup of your beverage to go. \n\nGreat place overall."
1,"I was going to the All American eyeglass shop in the same shopping center to get a lens fixed that had popped out and it was a choice for Jack in the Box or the Good Egg for lunch while I waited for repairs and well, any non-fast food port in a culinary storm.\n\nI know, I know, breakfast place, order breakfast! However, it was about 1 pm and I wanted lunch so I order a club sandwich with a side Caesar salad. The club sandwich was okay but the side salad with a little bowl of regular salad with the dressing sort of poured on top. The lettuce seemed a bit wilted and the dressing was blah. As for the Sandwich it was okay but the bacon was surprisingly tasteless. Bottom line, it was healthier than Jack in the Box, and the waitress was super nice (even asked if I wanted a to-go ice tea) but the meal,from a culinary standpoint, was just blah. \n\nI don't hate the place but when in the breakfast place, get breakfast. I have a feeling they do that pretty well."
0,"Not a worker in sight.  Had to ask for help twice before somebody finally came after 15 minutes.  Girl at checkout asked if i found everything ok.  I said no that Lowes only had one of three items i needed.  She only responded with a blank stare.  Poorly stocked also.  For example, 66 quart storage bins had no lids stocked."
3,"Rubio's is my favorite place to get some vegetarian tacos that I don't have to drive all the way downtown for. The grilled portabello and poblano gourmet tacos make me happy. They made me sad for awhile because for some reason they were taken off of the menu for a few months, and during that time I boycotted Rubio's. But as soon as I found out that they were back I came in to get my beloved tacos. Baby portabellos, poblano peppers, avocados, cheese, and some kind of spicy cream sauce all on a corn tortilla. Mmmmmm!\n\nI also like their chips, they aren't like eating a salt lic like the chips at Chipotle. They are just the right amount of salty. The salsa that I like the best is the roasted chipotle salsa. Its got this really nice smokey flavor. I wish I could buy that at the store and eat it all of the time. I've had all of the other salsas at other times but I don't care too much for them. I also am not a fan of their beans that come with the meal. Most of the time they are really watery and I am just not a fan.\n\nI come to this location the most often, and the only thing bad about it is they have this really strange guy who works there and who is mostly always there when we come in, who likes to get a little too personal for me. Tone it down, dude. But other than that, I can't complain about this place."
3,A fun stop on a long road.
1,"I usually love places with a 50's diner atmosphere and walking into this place, it was no exception - it's cute. The jukebox, booths, decor, etc, etc make this a fun-looking place. The food (I had a burger) was okay, but nothing special. On another occasion, I went in with the sole purpose of getting a chocolate malt to go for my boyfriend and it was over $6 for just a malt. That was the point when I realized I would never be back to 5 & Diner. I think that's outrageous and hell, they're almost robbing you."
0,Horrible and liars.  I asked them to not run my credit and wouldn't sign a info sheet. A few days later I checked my credit and their was a hard inquiry from them. We will spread the word about their dishonest practices and of course never buy from them.
4,"I have been going to Dr. Patel since my first child was born over 10 yrs. ago.  Since then, he has taken on the rest of our family including me and my husband.  He always gets you in whenever you need it and his staff is nice.  I like that he himself treats his patients and he doesn't have nurses and PA's doing his work for him."
0,"Unfortunately, I have not had much of a great experience with this doctor. I came in to get my labs completed as a requirement for graduate school. At the appointment, I brought in the paper that listed the labs to be completed. When the results came back a few labs that were required on the documentation were missing. I understand that these things do happen, so I returned to the office to see about doing another test to obtain these values. When I met with the doctor he asked me why I did not mention this before and to not assume that these labs should be completed, even though the documentation provided initially asked for these values. I was dismissed with him telling me \""I was wasting his time\"" as he wrote an order for me to complete the labs elsewhere. I do understand that these mistakes do happen, but did not expect the doctor to tell me I was wasting his time as I did not come to blame him for his mistakes, but was met with defensiveness anyway. Other times he has been kind and has was helpful with answers, so I was not expecting this on my return visit."
0,"Horrible wait time. Waited almost an hr to get help. Just to make a payment! workers are super slow. Sprint service sucks and obviously the stores/workers also, exactly why we went to tmobile instead!"
3,"I really like coming here because they have so many things that I am just entertained even if I don't go in to necessarily buy something.. though I usually always end up buying something because their prices are GREAT.  Their kitchen stuff has great prices (on the order of .80c and 1.50 for some little gadgets!), as that's the section where I usually start my browsing.\n\nTheir food/drink section is impressive in variety and regions and is well too stocked for me to spend lots of time perusing... I'll just end up buying more chocolate or more wine than I already need.  But I've found some fun and unique treats there as me-gifts or gifts for others.\n\nTheir furniture stuff can be a bit pricey, but I like that is is more 'unique' and has a 'worldy' look to it.  Also, they have TONS of little chotchkies (sp?) - so if you like looking at chotchkies, this is the spot.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention - they double charged me on something and I went back the next day to tell them about it to get it fixed and they easily and quickly fixed it.. no hassle, no problems, no looking at me suspiciously.  That was appreciated."
1,We only went to this place once and I wasn't very impressed.  We had to wait outside in the hot sun for a table since the restaurant is so small.  The food was nothing exciting and it is not a comfy atmosphere at all.  The only good thing is that the prices are low and I am sure it would be fast service on a weekday since you order at the counter.
4,I love this place! The staff is amazing and always makes you feel at home. I'm obsessed with their breakfast burritos. And the biscuits and gravy? Amazing!
4,"Clare, the sales person, was excellent. She wasn't pushy and helped us get an excellent deal on a really, really nice mattress. The delivery guys a couple days later were polite, prompt and super helpful. They forgot something when the delivered the bed in the morning and came back at 9:30PM on their own to bring it to us. Really impressed with the level of service and would recommend to anyone."
0,"I'm very sure that I will never purchase from this company ever again. The following is not the only issue with my purchase, however it is the most pressing. It's been a month since my return of a mattress that was never even delivered to my home, and they have had unknown problem after problem processing my return which has stalled the return of my money.\n\nFirst the Ahwatukee Store Manager stopped taking my calls, Mike was great when I was purcahsing but had Clare speak to me whenever I followed up on my return,  claiming that corporate was processing it. Then when I called the customer service line, the guy brought me to tears. Between having no information on a month old return, claiming that a Tempur-Pedic base has no warranty, and refusing to let me speak to a manager, I felt completely de-humanized and powerless. As if I would never again see my [significant amount] of money.\n\nAfter harnessing my Google-fuu, I found corporate accounts payable who admitted my return had never even been addressed (over a month later), let alone processed, and she would bring it to a manager and I'd receive a call in 24hrs. No call. I just spoke with them, only to find out still nothing has been done. \n\nThe only things I can do is call, and start speaking up about this unprofessional treatment.. I feel completely powerless while they sit on my money, the Store Manager has his commission, and I have nothing. But if this continues I will have to look into further, and more serious, appropriate legal action. \n\nHow do you file a collections claim on a corporation?"
0,I really was disappointed by the customer service at this store. It seems like the employees really couldn't care less about customers and the company doesn't enforce any sort of respect. It's also messy and cramped! I also tried calling in to ask about an item. I got hung up on twice and every person who answered the phone was rude. Do yourself a favor and make the drive to the Gilbert store.
0,"So I used to eat at this location\n\nAnd I loved it\n\nBut slowly\nEach time I ate here\n\nI'd get a tummy ache\n\nThen my boyfriend was all like \""hey, everytime I eat chipotle I get diarrhea\""\n\nSo it wasn't just me!\n\nWe continued to eat here though, because we loved it.\nAnd we'd make sure we had no where to be for a few hours after eating it.\n\nI know, we're weird.\n\nBut we got sick of getting sick.  Poo.  Literally."
3,After watching the show about the next great restaurant or whatever it was called I really have a bad taste in my mouth for the dude that started this company but damnit if he doesn't offer a darn good product.\n\nI really only like the carnitas here.  Steak seems to be hit and miss and I've never been a chicken fan.  \n\nGreen salsa is the best.  Pinto beans all the way.  Rice with a hint of lemon and cilantro is so darn good.  \n\nTry their quesadillas - so yummy.\n\nThis location has the friendliest people.
1,"I love the food, but I've had it with online ordering; which is why I'm not giving them 4 or 5 stars. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE!!!\n\nThis is the 5th time they screw up mine and my friends' order. My friend Pre ordered his Steak Bowl from Chipotle this location on 54th street. Which always has a line out the door. \n\nOrder:\nWhite Rice, Steak, Blk Beans, Pinto Beans, Veggies, Medium Salsa and Cheese (simple)\n\nWhat he got:\nBrown rice, Blk Beans, Medium Salsa.\n\nAs it was a to-go, we did not notice this until after we got back to the office."
1,"This is a standard looking hole-in-the-wall Mexican food restaurant just like a gazillion others in Phx.  Unfortunately this one is pretty lame.  \n\nI got two enchiladas, one chicken and one beef.  Neither meat is anything I'd recommend or buy again.    The dark brown sauce scared me and didn't taste much better than it looked.  Some sort of beef sauce I think.  It wasn't awful but it was nothing I want again. My copilot on this adventure said her chicken tacos were not so good either, and when we got back to the office she noted that we won't be trying that place again.\n\nThe place was super quiet for a Friday at 12:30pm. Punch machines were off, a 4yr old was scootering around behind the counter, and I think there were only two people working.  I wonder if they'll be in business next week."
4,"Great selection, as one would exxpect from a Bath and Body Works.\n\nBut even better than that, great people.  They are always so helpful.  I will always come to this location."
1,"I think I need more adventitious dining parents, at their request I returned here with them for dinner.\n\nThere was no wait at 6:20pm on a Sunday, perhaps the rising prices and dwindling fish selection has disparaged more than just myself. \n\nAs if the fresh fish selection of four was not small enough, my fist choice, the trout was no long in stock. I decided to give the Cajun tilapia a try. I know tilapia is a garbage fish but their menu did not leave me much choice. The fish was dry, tasteless and had the texture of a overcooked fish stick. On the side was broccoli, that was over cooked and limp, probably from a frozen source, and then French fries.\n\nAs usual the meal included, a small Cesar salad, and the salt filled cheese bisques.   \n\nOur waitress was a bit odd, she seemed to have just finished orientation and said all of the lines about the menu, etc, it was a bit awkward."
0,"This night at Red Lobster was the worst. We came here on a Saturday night. We had to wait but, not a problem at all. You expect that on a busy night. The place is under construction and that is not good to keep it open while that is going on. It actually smelled like chemicals and building materials. The worst part about this night was our waiter Bob. He had no interest in doing a good job that night or in making any money apparently. We had the worst possible service that you could imagine. Old and cold coffee, wrong drinks and ,he even put the wrong number on our order. So that when someone else brought out our food they could not find us.  The cheese biscuts are not what they used to be, All fake ingredients in my book. Not happy at all with our experiance here, I absolutly will say we will never be back."
2,"Treated aunt to a belated birthday dinner (three other adults and two children dining; I only had a cocktail and two teensy flakes off of the top of a cheddar biscuit.  BE AWARE that EACH biscuit contains 8 grams of fat, 2.5 grams saturated, and a total of 150 calories.  \n\nThey ordered *Berry-Mango daiquiris http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg#d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg and I a *classic mojito. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA#iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA  I heard that the berry-mango was a balanced mixture of fruit flavors, but the alcohol was hardly-detectable.  The alcohol flavor wasn't missed at all, though.  Everyone who had them \""ooh\""ed and \""ahh\""ed.  I wished a simple mango version was available, but I'm also glad it wasn't, or else I would never have found out that RL, or more specifically the bartender working that shift, served a TERRIFIC mojito!  My first sip disappointed, but once I swirled everything a few times with the straw, the drink actually turned out to be one of the best mojitos I've ever had!  It's a classic version, made with Bacardi Superior rum, muddled mint, pure cane sugar (don't like ones made with simple syrup-- too sweet), freshly-squeezed lime juice, and club soda.\n\nI would never be able to dine here (aversion to farm-raised fish, intolerance/allergy to whitefish, shellfish allergies, and Blue Bunny ice cream choices contain corn syrup), but I wouldn't mind enjoying a mojito while everyone else dines!  :)\n\n*Berry-mango daiquiri = 350 calories\n*Mojito = 190 calories"
2,"After 2 years of listening to my bf tell me he was going to take me here I took matters into my own hands and figured out this is the place he was talking about. We came in around 2 and ordered my bfs favorite papaya salad, Tom Yum soup, sweet and sour fish and 2 Thai teas. \n\nMeh. It wasn't bad, but I've had better. Our bill was $40, a little pricey, especially since the first two were only appetizers."
3,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't too busy, unlike their weekday lunch rushes. We ordered the pad thai, pad see ew, and green curry lunch specials. The lunch specials are a really good deal, at only $8 for a large portion, salad, and egg roll! (The salad and egg roll weren't that impressive though)\n\nI really liked the flavor of the pad thai (and that it came with peanuts!), but was disappointed because the pad see ew was really over-sauced. The green curry was good, but nothing special. So I would recommend the pad thai. The staff was also very friendly, and there's a 10% discount if you pay in cash!"
3,"Swaddee is awesome. I love the Chicken Noodles and the Thai Iced Tea. This place can get a little hectic during lunch so go early if you can. When you order they ask you how spicy you want your food, 1-5. I always get a 3, but the spice can be anywhere from a 2-4 which works for me."
2,"Not bad.  We walked in about 9:30 on Saturday, and had the Ribs, Calamari, Side Salad, and the pepperoni pizza.  Everything was good.  The mashed potatos that came with the ribs, were the best things i ate,  really well seasoned.  The pizza was a good quality pie as well.  I guess my only wish was that they had a jug wine option like Macaroni grill.  If I'm going to pay $15 - $18 for chain resturant food, at least have a $4 glass of terrible wine for me to wash it down with.  Other than that, I thought it was PFG.  Not good enough to make it on my list yet, but maybe another visit, and I'll have become a fan."
1,"They take reservations so you can come in at your scheduled time to hand you a hostess wait wand.  Waiting area smells of dirty people and a spilled dip bottle.  Bar smells like old spilled drinks.  They only received 2 stars because of house made pasta, but I'm felling a bit nervous to eat here because of the smell."
1,"After seeing all the 2nd pasta helping commercials on TV, my boyfriend and I decided to have Italian for date night. We were seated promptly upon arrival but noticed an odd smell coming from the dining room. The wood burning grill was close to where we were seated but it smelled off. Our server was slow to arrive for drink orders and my boyfriend kept having to drink my water because our server neglected to fill water. I ordered a glass a wine, which of course was delicious. Bread came and was honestly the best thing we ate all night. I loved the olive oil and spice mixture! I ordered the pasta Carraba and a Caesar salad. The salad was really over-dressed and the dressing had quite a peppery kick. I like pepper but not overpowering. For the 2nd pasta helping, there were only 3 options and none of them resembled the pasta on the commercial. The pasta I ordered was very disappointing, very mushy. The chicken was grilled nicely but for $15.50, the pasta wasn't prepared better than what I could have made at home for a lot cheaper. We skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home. I did like that we were given bread, olive oil and spice mixture (since that was delicious). It has been a while since I had visited Carraba's and now I know why. Everything was mediocre and for me, I don't like visiting places that are just OK."
4,"With a rich atmosphere, pleasant wait staff, and food to die for, this restaurant is truly something special\n\nMy wife and I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade, Stuffed Mushrooms, Chicken Bellagio, and Mahi Mahi Mediterranean. \n\nEvery morsel of what we ate was divine.\n\nI highly recommend the mushrooms, and trying the Bellagio put my mouth in food Heaven.\n\nTiana C was extremely pleasant waiting on us, and other than maybe prices being a \""smidge\"" high, and I do mean just a smidge, there's nothing I would change about Cheesecake Factory"
2,"I like the Cheesecake Factory menu, but the portions, calories, and sodium and fat counts are really too much. I like their happy hour, however."
0,"For reasons I don't fully understand I tried to eat here tonight.  As usual getting a seat was a chore...whether the place is crowded or not (not in this case).\n\nAnyhow I sit down, menus arrive and then some moron walks up to talk with the folks in the table behind me and he's smoking a e-pipe!!!!   Really!!!!????  WTF!!!!!\n\nCheesecake Factory I'm putting this one on you for allowing it to happen. \n\nI'm done with you.\n\nIf zero was a choice I'd go with that."
0,"We were waiting 15 min for someone serve us, and then 10 min for ordering food, the coming 20 min for food cooking and came out no napkin no silverware but a rush guy threw the dish on the table then left.  That's my first experience eat at CHEESECAKE FACTORY, but also last time too at least the last time!  Btw, the food is under cook!  Good luck!  Guys."
1,"Just went there on a Saturday afternoon.  Went to check out in front (by the exit) and there was no one there; no one around.  So we went to the checkout near the mall entrance.  No one there; no one around.  I love B&N, but this one apparently has lousy management."
1,"Not my favorite place. I went today to get added RAM for my MAC computer. I was unable to purchase this at the apple store due the fact that apple only carries current stuff in their store bc space is limited. The guy that was helping at Best Buy, not friendly, not knowledgable, unable to answer questions I had. Needless to say, I did not purchase from Best Buy. Off to Frys electronics I go."
3,"Seriously, their happy hour prices can't be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesn't involve Denny's or Olive Garden this is a great choice."
2,"I've been 2 times here and both had a good ending. I enjoy what I order, which is mainly sushi and some of their pasta dishes. Good service and nice environment."
0,"Terrible service,rude staff, rude manager...will never,ever give kona grill my business. Waited over an hour for a table at happy hour, informed all staff we were waiting for table. Watched multiple times as other people stole tables that opened up. Staff and manager did not care and were rude."
0,"As it turns out this place is not a restaurant with a bar, its a bar with a restaurant. Made the mistake of bringing my 8 year old. One look at the kiddie menu and i knew i should have left. Instead of just making miniature meals from there menu they did the old, don't bring your kids here again, they are not welcome routine. I know ours popular in this obese children's society to feed kids crap but who the hell feeds their kids macaroni and cheese for dinner? Isn't that a side dish? When did this become a main course from hell? How lazy can a parent be than to serve a kid macaroni and cheese. Oh yeah, order macaroni and cheese. So as it goes we order from the main menu. Chicken with mozzarella sandwich and i had the salmon. It was way too much to pay for frozen meals. The rice was swimming in soy sauce and pineapple. I'm a carb addict and if i can't eat it, its not worth eating. The green beams i have to say were the highlight of the meal. They tasted like the ones at outback which i just love. The salmon, just more frozen fair. Parmesan fries uneatable, sandwich, just not worth it. The ciabatta roll was dry and tasteless. I think since thus place failed so miserably at a restaurant they note solely cater to the bar. Its a shame they can't handle both."
1,"I came here because I've heard good things about the reverse happy hour, although it was for the Gilbert location but since we were closer to this location we made the mistake of coming here. I asked to sit close to the fish tank so my daughter could enjoy the view and was told if we wanted to partake in reverse HH we would have to sit elsewhere. We were told we could sit on the other side at the only open table in view (still dirty) and proceeded to seat ourselves. After several minutes of waiting my daughter politely asked for our table to be cleaned. Our server finally appeared, our drinks and food came out at a snail's pace. The chicken satay over a slaw was good, peanut sauce good(have had better) whatever the other sauce was, awful. The apple brie and pepperoni flatbread were ok but quickly became cold because the air conditioner was on so high you'd think it was summer outside. Average food with poor service, the only reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1 was the nicest gentleman whose job only appeared to be to bus tables was polite to my daughter & myself, was personable and was the only one who genuinely seemed happy to be there. He deserves a mention, the tips and a raise. We might try hh again at Kona but definitely not at this location!"
2,"I really like Kona's menu and the location, which alone could earn a 4 star yelp review from me.  I give Kona 3 stars because of the seating restrictions and service during Happy Hour, which is usually when I end up here.\n\nThe Happy Hour menu has a limited but decent selection of food and drinks.  While Kona has a nice patio setup, you have to fight for tables out there or in the bar area since the HH specials do not carry over into the dining room area (which is totally empty during HH).  Don't be surprised when your bill comes out at the end of your meal to find a group of hunger people hovering next to your table waiting to grab your seat as soon as you stand up.  Also, the service during HH is hit or miss.  You either get a really great and attentive server, or you end up with several people randomly checking in on you once they realize that all the drinks at your table have been empty for 10 minutes."
3,"The Great Indoors is owned by Sears and has a lot of their same policies.  They have a wide selection of appliances, home decor, paint, blinds, electronics...  Prices are about what you would find at Sears.\n\nSince Sears has a matching policy, we did have them try to price match our appliances when we were building our home and they did put limitations on it so make sure you get the details first before counting on it.\n\nTheir credit card is like most others.  For every $2500 that you spend you get a $20 gift card redeemable at their store.  I have done really well finding deals there.  You have to catch things on sale though.  They have a semi-clearance sale twice a year."
1,"Love the clothes,hate the staff! I'm sorry but something goes wrong every single time I come here. Today, brought 5 items to the counter, came home with 4. And that was from the kiddy mgr who had to take over because the rest had never seen a check before. After his 10 minutes of flubbing and absolutely ignoring anything I asked him he finally rang it up. Grrrr I hate having to go back."
3,Holy Hamburger Batman! This Red Robin has recently undergone a remodel and does it ever look cool -- maybe a taddish Hard Rock meets a pub kindof feel. Still super family friendly and fun -- Check out the cheeseburger stools in the lobby so fun!\n\nAs always you can have a good experience or a moderate one with service but we have never had a huge problem with it. Our server this time was right on the money and fixed errors in the order immediately (tomatoes on salad). \n\nEverything we ate was delicious and hot when it got to the table and we all left with full tummies. My husband and I shared the Southern Charmer (special burger) and it was so tasty. My two kiddos had the kids fish and chips and a corn dog. We also shared a pumpkin shake. \n\nWe always enjoy Red Robin and continue to return for a fun atmosphere that is kid friendly.\n\nCheck out the 8 track wall are and the soda bottle lights in the bar. \nLots of fun.
4,Great service.. Friendly staff!!!!
2,"4 stars for the young bear stuffer guy rockin the converse shoes, he tried his best to keep my birthday girl's attention. She just turned 2 (if you read my reviews she is the one that might be autistic or has adhd and is wild nutz) and she was just all over the place.\n\nNow, this is where I have to take off a star... at the check out... my daughter had a build a bear purse that she stuffed with hearts (both the purse and hearts were BAB, I was not buying them). I quickly snatched it without her looking and put it behind my me and on top of a shelf.... obviously so my daughter would not see it and scream. Well Mr. Lazy from behind the counter (not my cashier) starts yelling MAAAAM give it to me and I will put it away...  HERE GIVE THAT TO ME AND I WILL PUT IT BAAAAAACK. My daughter started wondering what he was yelling about and she was looking around. \nThe guy was ridiculous, my husband was paying and he even turned around to see what the guy was yelling at.\n2x I replied to him that I didn't want her to see it and then I just walked away.\n\nThat jackass should know if a mother tries to hide something away from a child that he should not create a scene. All he had to do was put it back after we left."
3,"It's nice to have kids build a bear. Unique and kids seem to love it . Expensive! We are going to do it one more time for our kid , that's it!"
2,"A Sunday brunch connoisseur cannot ever get blown away by this place. \n\nI will not complain about the ambience, it is indeed pretty. But I'm definitely not going to vouch for the food here. I don't know if this has something to do with the Chandler location but nothing on the menu is upto the mark.\n\nWhen you look at the menu it sounds grander than it actually is. Believe me when I say that the pancake or french toast looks far more appetizing at IHOP. I'd suggest that you spend 10 mins preparing the Potato and Leek packet soup (by Knorr) at home rather than taste any of their creamy soups.\n\nDuring the shopping season they put novices behind the cash counters and take inordinately long to serve a plate that totally falls short of your expectations.\n\nA strategic location or good interiors does not make for a good restaurant!"
2,"While they have delicious food, seating is very limited and they are MUCH too slow in cleaning the tables. Too many customers standing around looking for a place to sit and eat."
3,"Chain Mexican food...that is actually good!?!?! No Way!! But yes! This is one Chain you can't turn your nose up at! \n\nWhether it is for lunch or dinner, I am never let down with their food or service! Their lunch menu is affordable and good serving sizes, so you don't feel like you are breaking the bank.\n\nDinner has so many choices, but I will only name the two I rotate between. I am a huge Chile Rellenos fan, I order them every where I go and I am particular about where to get the good ones. Abuelo's has excellent Chile Rellenos!\n\nThe next dish that is probably the best one on the menu and they know it, is their LOS MEJORES DE LA CASA, which is 2 small perfectly cooked bacon wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and 2 shrimp with bacon, cheese and jalapenos, mmmmm so so so Good!!! Good along with all its synonyms in the thesaurus!!!\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, go! What are you waiting for!?!?!?"
3,"I've eaten here many times with my family and the food and service has always been great. It's not receiving my restaurant coveted fifth star because I find the food selection to be on the small side. Also, the desert menu has only two deserts on it and if your not a fan of traditional Mexican desserts your out of luck. I usually order 'The Laredo' which is an enchilada dish with beans and rice it's delicious and while it is a sizable portion it's not overwhelming. The atmosphere here is lovely you aren't talking over anyone and the booths are a bit taller so you have some privacy which is a big plus for me. I hate constantly locking eyes with the person in the next booth when I'm having a conversation or chowing down! Give this place a try, I'm pretty confident you won't be disappointed."
1,"Great place for mexican food if your white and never had homemade. Just like Seranos or any other chain, plus its more expensive."
4,"Love their chips and salsa's, sangria swirl margaritas are delicious too! Great happy hour and service!"
4,"Everyone was very pleasant today.  I love shopping here they really take care of you.  I broke my bottle of of Chanel Coco Mademoiselle and they actually replaced it for me.  Amazing!  I started a page on facebook about it https://www.facebook.com/BestChanelPerfume \""Like\"" us!"
4,This review is for the MAC makeup area in Nordstroms. Everyone needs to go see the lovely Whitney at MAC. She is a fabulous and friendly young lady who makes shoppinh for the right color so easy. She matched my skin color and tried out several different colors to find the right one. She was getting ready to leave for the night but still spent a ton of time with me showing me everything I asked for. I will be back here just for Whitney and for all my mac makeup :) Thanks Whitney!!
1,"My girlfriend got a dress from said location, and while wearing it I noticed that ALL of the strap thingies are twisted 180 degrees. I am not sure if it is a manufacturer error or the designer was on crack or cocaine, or both but I'd sure like to figure it out. Although she looks pretty darn good in the dress, the straps really grind my gears!"
0,"I bought a suitcase here during the holidays in 2011 and also purchased the warranty. The suitcase broke so I went to sears again to exchange it like the sales person said I could. It turns out they lied and don't do exchanges. After calling the 800 number they will give you a gift card of the purchase price. Which means I can't get a new suitcase since the price now is much higher. Goodbye, I'm going to Macy's."
0,This location is pretty bad.  Be warned if you go in at an off hour they will just let you stand there and never take your order.  I have been here twice and seen none behind the counter at all.  Not sure where they go. They tend to always put way too many raw onions in the burritos.  If you have to eat here tell them to hold the onions.\n\nMaybe the other locations are better.
2,"Food is delicious, but agree with other reviewers. You don't get much for what you pay. Way too pricey!"
1,"I have been to this location a few times, but the last time I came here was a few nights ago. I just wanted soup because it was cold out and we were at Chandler Mall, so OG seemed like the appropriate choice. We got there and it wasn't too busy and were seated. Our waitress came by and asked us to sample some wine and when we declined she took on this huge attitude and said 'so what DO you want to drink?' with almost disdain in her voice. Whoa lady, sorry for not wanting your cheap wine sold for expensive prices... this was kind of the theme of the night. The waitress seemed to be in a very bad mood. The food was the standard mediocre fair that comes from all OGs. The salad had a giant uncut piece of lettuce in it, the soup was fine, the BF got an alfredo pizza that was dry, but fine. So this place gets a big meh."
2,I usually come out here after the lunch hour rush. You would think its slow enough that you can be seated immediately. Not. 3 stars is all i can give.
0,"Terrible customer service!  I waited for over an hour without so much as a greeting. I would have left sooner, but I was due fir my 6 month check up on my wedding ring. On of the associated attended some else who wasn't waiting as long because they were standing closer. Not that anyone was keeping track of who was there. When I was finally attended the lady checked the ring in front of me, shook it near her ear,  said nothing is loose and set it down. Did not even bother to offer to clean it and didn't seem like she was going to document it. I had to ask for the cleaning. I was interested at looking at some earrings, but I was so appalled by the lack of customer service..they lost a sale."
0,"Drove by, they are closed :("
3,"This is a pretty cool store to shop in! They have a ton of interesting, high end kitchen appliances available. It seems like everything is chrome, very high end, and awesome looking. Plus, they will give you a coffee while you're shopping when they are demonstrating their high end coffee maker. It's a fun experience for sure."
2,Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n8 Food\n8 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n7 Value
1,"Ya know, I almost thought about giving Z-Tejas five stars just for having a separate, gluten-free menu, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it because the service was way below what I expect when I eat out.\n\nWe, a party of five (including my parents, who were visiting from Scotland), were initially seated at a really cramped table when several booths were open. Remedied this by asking to be moved to one of them. In addition, we didn't receive a kids' menu until we had waited around for about 20 mins. So, picture this, I have a hyper kid on my hands because his blood sugar levels are low and he's ready to chew his own arm off as well as those of everyone else surrouding him. Great... I will say that a very large party (around 20 people) was seated nearby and our server was one of many attending to their every need.\n\nOur server had an excuse; he was new to the establishment and still in training. He was very cordial and was trying his best to deal with my gluten-free requirements. Turns out he wasn't given any training on the menu, with which he was very unfamiliar. Great...way to instill confidence that I'm not going to have a gluten-related \""episode.\"" Let me be clear, I don't blame him for this whatsoever. My hat goes off to him for trying. What got me was the dirty look I received from one of the female servers...WTF! What did I ever do to her. Message to her: You're in the wrong line of work, lady. Try collections or repossessions. I almost handed her back my gluten-free steak and vegs. My give up...\n\nThe food, when it did finally arrive, was good, albeit a little bland in my case. Why the heck people think gluten-free food has to taste bland is beyond me. I wish Gordon Ramsay would come in and rescue kitchens from their gluten-free nightmares. My parents both enjoyed their meals; they ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans. My son enjoyed his cheeseburger, but then what kid doesn't? And, my husband enjoyed his seared ahi tuna steak, but felt the portion size was a little on the small side (he's a big guy). \n\nNext time, I'll try the chambord margarita. I don't think I can go wrong with that -- at least it's alleged to taste good and it's gluten-free. =) I will, however, be checking out the restaurant in Tempe and not coming back to the one in Chandler."
1,"katie and i went here on sunday before an ikea trip.\n\nlet me start off by saying we were seriously starving, i was so pumped to order my jerk chicken salad. we walk in and theres a 'bloody mary bar' and it looked absolutely disgusting. i alsmot lost my appetite by being greeted by that filthy mess of a germ bar. \n\n i sat down while katie used the restroom and i ordered us water and myself a drink. \n\nkatie and i sat talking for a bit and i asked,\n\""are you going to get a drink?\""\n\""ya, if he ever comes back\"" was her response\n\nthen i realized it had been 10 minutes before we saw our waiter again. finally, he came around and tried to make us order chips. we were so hungry we almost did but passed them up. we ordered our food, it was sooooo cold in there I couldn't order my salad, instead i opted for a breakfast dish. and let me just say breakfast is not their strong point. \n\nanother 15 or so minutes go by and we can't take it so we order chips. \n\nthen we notice everyone around us is eating corn bread. HEY WHERE'S OUR CORNBREAD?!?! we don't need chips and salsa, we're supposed to get cornbread! \n\nso our waiter passes by us again so we ask/shout for cornbread.\n\nthen, not even lying, our food, chips and salsa, and cornbread come to the table all at once. so overwhelming\n\nthe chips and salsa were not good. \nmy food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada.\n\nif you eat here, stick to the jerk chicken salad(one of the best salads ive ever had) or the spicy chicken pasta which is perfectly spicy.\n\n2 stars for service\n2 stars for food on this trip(usually i would give it 4)\n2 stars for sunday morning ambiance(dinner is the time to go here)"
3,"I haven't been to Z'Tejas in years.  So when a date asked if I wanted to meet there, I thought what a great idea, now I'll totally have something to Yelp about!\n\nWe met at 6 pm on a Saturday night, and while clearly busy, it only took them 10 minutes to seat us.  The restaurant was nicely laid out, plenty of room between tables, and I didn't feel like I was crammed in a corner.  The noise level was perfect too, something that is missing from so many places.\n\nOur server was friendly and quick, and answered menu questions with suggestions and good information. I ended up ordering the 5 Cheese Macaroni & Cheese, and my date got the El Diablo chicken.  Both were pasta dishes, but very different.  The mac & cheese was gooey and tasty, and very filling - no appetizer and I could not finish my plate.  I really wanted to - the bacon on the top was the perfect touch.  My date's chicken and pasta was spicy, but not overwhelming - subtle flavors playing out nicely together. \n\nThe portions were large enough that I couldn't even think about dessert, and was so glad we passed on an appetizer.  Overall it was a great meal, and I would have given them 5 stars, if it wasn't a chain restaurant."
1,"Tonight Z'Tejas let me down. It is unfortunate because I love the food here. I booked a party for six for a reservation at 7:30pm. We were seated right away in the upper level of the restaurant. Our waitress came over right away and took our drink orders. It all started out pretty well.\n\nOne of the members of our party had never been here before so he wanted to order three appetizers for us to all share. I recommended the Tejas Trio (queso, salsa and guacamole) and he told our waitress to pick two of her other favorites. Now I understand that he did leave this up to her discretion however, she chose two other items with shrimp and seafood in them. As a waitress I would have maybe considered that not everyone in the party would have liked seafood. I would have understood maybe one other appetizer with seafood but not both. Again, it was left to her discretion so I cannot say too much about this one.\n\nI tried to get her attention two different times to order a margarita, both times she swiftly walked away, maybe I needed to be louder. All things I could have shook off if our meal would have been up to par as it usually is. I had recommended to the other members of our party to order the 21 day aged filet. We had previously had an amazing experience with this steak. Three of us decided to order this item. When they came out they were all New York strip and not filet. Not really that big of deal but when you are a expecting one cut of steak and you receive a different one, it is a little disappointing. My steak was supposed to be a filet topped with a peppercorn crust and topped with a mushroom sauce. It came out as a New York strip, topped with the peppercorn crust but no sauce whatsoever. My dining companions decided to keep the New York strips in lieu of returning them to re-fire filets. I decided to have a filet re-fired because my steak came out completely wrong. I reordered the new steak with the Gorgonzola butter instead of the peppercorn crust because it looked dry when it was brought out.\n\nAfter waiting fifteen minutes, after all of my dining companions were finished eating, I received my new steak. It was a filet after all but it still came out with the peppercorn crust instead of the Gorgonzola butter. I just feel as though the entire night our waitress did not listen to anything we said. I really am not that picky but after getting all three of our steaks wrong, and getting mine wrong twice I was irritated. This was the place that my fianc\u00e9 and I had recommended to out of town guests and I feel as though it was a big let down tonight. I just do not think our waitress could handle a big party along with serving her other tables.\n\nI still might be back because I know how good the food can be here. I just think we came on an off night. Too bad."
0,Made reservation because had other engagements. Showed up and waited twenty minutes. They said sorry people who have your table haven't left yet. As if they only have one table. When we informed them of our time constraints. They made no offer to help out. Like the food but not so good at keeping the reservation. And really that's the most important part
3,"Best service I've ever gotten at a PF Changs. I love when a waitress actually takes the time to talk to us about something besides what we want to drink and eat. Ours did just that and made us laugh. The food was the same as always, but her animation regarding our mutual guilty pleasure, Project Runway, made the lunch memorable. Cheers to that."
4,Wonderful service.  Wonderful food.  Pf Chang never disappoints.   One of the best Hot n Sour soups ever.  Lettuce wraps are great.  All entres were excellent.  A great experience.  Thanks Stefanie for the nice service.
2,"I really think this has the best ramen I have ever had. Service is surprisingly great, considering how packed it is every time I am here. Whenever someone come in town, I always suggest this place"
0,"Where do I start? Well first of all the website says 2 dollar PBR's. That's a no go. 2 dollar bowling, cool, whatever. Not that I can't afford my beers it's cool I don't mind paying. But obviously you're not too concerned about your online presence. Then as we're sitting the \""manager\"" comes over and tells us that she's closing early. Must be nice to be able to leave work when you feel like it. Maybe make a disclaimer on your site.. Oh wait... Maybe you're closing early because there's only 3 lanes playing? Maybe you're closing early because you scare people away by saying your closing? Probably the latter. Well anyways thanks for scaring us away!! We won't be back."
2,"The place is pretty comfortable and the prices aren't that bad. It's more a 3.5\n\nI had the bone in rib steak and I ordered it medium. as most of the times in almost every place I go, they overcooked it :(\n\nThe house pinoit noir was decent and in general the food was pretty good for the money.\n\nThe service was friendly but no refills on the water and the waitress never came back to ask if I would like another glass of wine. I would if she asked, but that never happened.\n\nAll in all, a good place to go, not super expensive and ok service."
4,I have been going to The Keg Steak House now ever since they first opened. I have enjoyed everything from the ambiance  to the wonderful food and the servers are great. I highly recommend this restaurant. Alot of quality for the price.
3,"Went to The Keg with my wife as she had never been and Flemings was booked.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The server was excellent.  He checked in often, presented himself very well and was attentive to our needs.  We had a bottle of Ridge that was delicious.  The brie appetizer was very good.  Now onto the steak:  Each of us ordered a bacon wrapped filet medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak came wrapped in bacon fat and was cooked closer to rare vs medium rare.  At times I'll order my steak rare or rare + so this wasn't a problem for me, but the bacon grizzle was unappetizing.  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was average.  The Keg does a good job, but if the could pay a little more attention to detail with respect to the food.  I think they try and turn out the food too fast and it just doesn't compare to other steak houses.  Definitely a AAA club.  If you want a real steak go to Flemings or Ruth Chris for a Big League experience."
1,"As a regular at The Keg next to Chandler Mall, it pains me to say that my last two visits were less than stellar. When setting up nearby tables, the busboy sent the utensils crashing across the tabletops. Twice in a row, there were families who could not control their children: screaming, doing somersaults in the aisles, etc. And then to order the recommended fish that turned out to be too dry to swallow...I am really disappointed! Where is the management presence?"
3,The Keg is a franchise and is my FAVORITE restaurant! This location in particular is slightly sub par in my book. On multiple occasions I've had to send food back because it just didn't taste right. On a good note I hosted my birthday dinner here and had a fairly large party. Our two servers were very accommodating and were able to keep up with our cocktail orders. Very fun place.
1,"A note to the owners of BJ's Restaurant & Brewery regarding the style of pizza you serve:\n\nI don't know what it IS, but I can tell you what its NOT, and its most definitely NOT 'Chicago-Style'.\n\nHow do I know this?  Because up until about a month ago, I called Chicago home for the last 20 or so years.\n\nPizza has three main ingredients- a crust, a sauce (typically a tomato-based sauce), and cheese (typically mozzarella).  Serving two out of the three does not mean you can still call it a pizza.  This is pass/fail, all or nothing, an you are not graded on a curve; there is no 'E' for effort.\n\nNow some will argue, but typically, 'Chicago-style' pizza has a thick crust and, in at least a couple of restaurants, the sauce and cheese layers are inverted, but the pizza HAS sauce (am I making my point here, or am I being too subtle?).\n\nDo yourself a favor, BJ.  Go to Chicago, and go to Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Due's, and Lou Malnotti's for a crash course in what 'Chicago-Style' pizza is, then come back here and fix this trainwreck of bread and cheese before you do any permament damage to the phrase 'Chicago-Style Pizza'; well, no more than you've already done.\n\nYour one saving grace is the beer you brew right on premises, otherwise this two-star review would be a one-star review, and I'd never have a reason to darken your doorstep, or subject anyone else to your bread with melted cheese on top.\n\nKeep up the good work on the beer, but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over.  Then I may try another one of your pies; until then, I'll just stick to the beer.\n\nViewing it from that angle, then, BJ's has a nice bar.  Its a bit loud inside for a restaurant, but for a bar, its just fine, and they do have lots of TVs tuned to just about anything you could want to watch.\n\nCome for the beer, stay for the... beer.  But if I've been too subtle, and you missed the point- don't bother with their 'pizza'."
2,"I was pretty disappointed with our visit here, we were expected so much more. The food was actually pretty good. We got the appetizer sampler combo and there was plenty of food on it. The avocado eggrolls are the best! I was not a fan of the california club flatbread appetizer pizza. I like the texture of the crust, but not a big fan of the toppings. I did not think the aioli that was drizzled on it went well with the pizza. But, you may like it because my girlfriend loved it.\n\nThe big disappointment was actually the beer surprisingly. i actually enjoyed my hefeweizen very much. Light, full-bodied and flavorful. The red I tried wasn't very good however. My girlfriend's stout was a huge disappointment. It was actually one of the worst stout we have ever had. Not a lot of flavor and had a weird aftertaste. \n\nI actually had better experiences with the BJs in California more, I don't know why. Each chain is a little different I guess."
1,"Slow service and cold nachos. I did like the seasonal Red Beer but the food and service were disappointing. My family has been conning here for years and while the food was never amazing, it was consistent and what I expected. This time food and service was both poor. We waited for ever the check and finally had to grab someone after ten minutes of not seeing our server again. Next time I'll just have the beer."
1,"Beer is ok.\n\nFood...meh.\n\nAfter watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule.\n\nThe menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.  There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage.\n\nAs for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts.  Overall not a good effort.\n\nSo assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also."
3,"First, it's a really nice bar.  The bartenders and staff are just great!  If you love beer, get the sampler and try them out, but the red ale is the best in my opinion!.\n\nHaving very fond memories of the amazing tuna poke at Lulu's in Lahaina on Maui, BJ's was in for some steep competition.  They succeeded in a wonderful take on the dish.  The avocado egg rolls made my belly happy as well, and were NOT at all greasy.\n\nVery very good.\n\nLots of TVs to watch various sporting events.  Lots of fun!"
0,"You have to understand that this is not the only Farmers agency that screws the common folk.  For a wind damage roof claim, they send out Mr. Zero six days after the storm to AZ from TX, and the guy comes up with some lame reasons for a complete denial of a $25,000 claim.  Think long and hard before you ever associate with Farmers in AZ.  I guess they do not think dust, 70 miles/hour wind and torrential rains can do any damage to your roof.  Stay away from them and you will not be sorry."
3,"Great happy hour.  We come here on our Tuesday veggies-and-booze night when we pick up our CSA.  I think their happy hour is five items for $6 each until 7:00.  There are also some cocktails and wine.  One of those five items is their burger which you can order rare plus, it comes out perfect this way.  Nice and creamy (instead of dry and chewy), full of flavor and juicy with nice thick pieces of bacon on it.  This might be our new favorite."
3,"Fianlly a happy hour that made me happy.\n\nIf you want some great food and drinks on a current economy budget the daily 5-7 happy hr may be a good choice for you.\n\n$5 specialty drinks including a pomitini poured at the table. This drink was quite good and yes girly.\n\n$5 appetizers including a great seared Ahi with a Jicama carrot salad. The Ahi has well spiced and of decent quality.\n\nThere are other $5 options as well.\n\n$6 burger that looked huge and induced 2 onion rings and a challa roll for a bun. \n\nThere also is a $12 ahi burger that is more of a croquet style with 2 onion rings or a portobello burger too.\n\nThis happy hr is available at the bar era, or in the more relaxed patio. There are heaters on the patio for the cooler nights.\n\nWith thees prices we kept eating, and eating and yes eating. We left stuffed on great food.\n\nI recommended a side of the saluted mushrooms of the menu as they really enhance any meal."
1,"I recently dined here and did not have a good experience. I dine at steakhouses frequently, Hillstone group, capital grille etc. and this place has never been comparable. My filet had no sear, my boyfriends dad's fish was over cooked, the creamed spinach was like soup, burrata was a joke and the saut\u00e9ed spinach was over salted. There pour on glasses of wine are quite small too, no different ounce options. For the prices, go to Capital Grille! Pretty disappointing, especially the waiter with the southern accent giving us attitude for complaining about the soupy creamed spinach and not wanting to order there chocolate lava cake, lol. Chandler is pretty disappointing with there options of restaurants. Not worth the drive."
2,"So- I always come here for happy hour.\nI actually haven't had regular dinner at this location- ever.\n\nThe happy hour menu is pretty cool- it's limited, but the stuff is tasty.\n\nI have, however, had a problem with slow service here.  Frustratingly slow actually- which isn't expected for this type of restaurant."
2,"Tasty food, attentive serving staff and good drinks including a fairly extensive wine list. We've been here often and will continue to come, HOWEVER...\n\nWe had a couple of non-food related problems on our visit a couple of weeks ago. \n\nAs we waited for our table, my daughter purchased the three of us drinks at the bar to make the wait a little more enjoyable. After being seated at our table, we were hit up by the manager for a new bar-bill total. Their mistake. This was a bit uncomfortable and looked to the surrounding tables as if we tried to pull a fast one. Not a comfortable situation. It seemed to me as if they might have taken the small hit instead of coming to our table asking for a couple of dollars. \n \nThe other issue involved virtually non-existent ADA restroom access for a person in a wheelchair. This is huge for injured persons in wheelchairs and if you happen to be a para or quadrapaligic, forget about it. First, you will not be able to get into the bathroom stall unless you are quite creative and then, when leaving, you will find the main door opens inward and even if you are able to get hold of the handle in the small space provided, you won't be able to open it and move your chair at the same time. Imagine having to ask someone walking by to open the door to the bathroom door so you can get back to your table\n\nWith all the ADA tools available, an upscale establishment like this should pony up for a push button door control!"
3,"Superb service! The food wasn't too bad either...\n\nWe ordered the spicy chili calamari. A little sweet, a little spicy...but just perfect!\n\nFollowed that up with the Main steak and a side of Fleming's potatoes (extra cheesy with jalape\u00f1os) and the specialty Parmesan crusted halibut topped with lump crab in a lemon/butter/cream sauce over saut\u00e9ed spinach....DELISH!\n\nBecause it was my fianc\u00e9's bday we ordered the lava cake. Takes 20 min to make but soooo worth the wait! Request to have Alan as your server - he's on point!"
1,Pork egg rolls have about as much pork as the vegetable spring rolls...not much.  Nothing like the advertisement.
2,"My wife and I rolled in here late yesterday afternoon to meet some of her friends. I dig joints like this as its relaxed and homey feeling. My eye immediately caught the huge vat barrel of salted peanuts at the front door - Score! Nothing like eating peanuts and chucking the shells on the floor or at other people. \n\nStarted off with a nice refreshing pint of Guinness which hit the spot and was on special. My wife and I ordered a dozen regular chicken wings to start.And by the way, when did that automatically become the norm to serve ranch with wings. I live for a while near Buffalo in Rotten-chester...eerrrr...Rochester New York and wings are definitely supposed to be served with Blue Cheese as the dipping sauce...I digress.\n\nAnywho, after I ordered I said to myself \""Dam, I forgot to tell her blue cheese\"" and not the nasty ranch everyone seems to serve. When the wings arrived they were attractively plump and not dripping in wing sauce, which I find disconcerting, and low and behold there are 2 LARGE ramekins of sauce - one blue cheese and one ranch. Steven Tyler Pj's, Steven Tyler PJ's...nice call Teakwoods. The wings were really good too...I nearly canceled my dinner order and replaced it with more wings (and I should have). Only issue with the wing app there was only 4 measly pieces of celery garnished on the plate.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Caesar Salad with \""Grilled & Chilled\"" shrimp. Sounded good...tasted awful...and for $13 bucks far from a good value. The salad itself wasn't bad but a Caesar should be mostly the hearts of Romaine and not inundated with the leafy crap.  I also overlooked the Caesar faux pas of the red onion rings...but the shrimp was unforgivable. My guess is the 13 dollar price point is based on the fact that it has shrimp in it and apparently the menu description of \""Grilled & Chilled\"" shrimp actually in essence means cook a large batch of shrimp and throw them in the cooler until someone orders that salad we serve them in. That pasty mushy old shrimp taste is still in my mouth today...zoiks! Fresh grilled skewer of shrimp off the grill in the salad would have made a HUGE difference AND justified me throwin' down 16 bucks for it, which is how much you figure it costs with the tip. Maybe the owner should watch an episode of Chef Ramsey's \""Kitchen Nightmares,\"" in fact any episode, and see how he preaches about the evils of the friggin' lazy cook it all ahead of time method. \n\nMy wife has been on Phase 1 of South Beach diet for 2 weeks and was totally cravin' a nice cheeseburger and fires. She was psyched to see sliders on the menu; however, they too were a HUGE disappointment, in fact she didn't even finish them. The bread was not moist and obviously stale, and the meat was dry and tasteless. They screwed up the fries...how do you screw up fries?  She said they were hot but dry and utterly tasteless...dude...some type of seasoning...any seasoning. \n\nTeakwoods did get 3 stars from which otherwise would have been 1 or 2 because the servers were cool and efficient, I liked the vibe, and free peanuts always pull me in like an electro-magnet. \n\nTwo parting words of advice for this restaurant \""Fresh Ingredients.\"""
1,What to say. Our waitress was so incredibly rude.  If my food wasn't good then I would give have given it one star. This was my first and last time going there. There is another bar/grill a few doors down that is so much better and less expensive. The only good thing about this place is that there are vegetarian items on the menu.
2,"Out of a dozen visits, its still a tossup if I'd recommend it. The service, food, and ambiance varies greatly from day to day and also lunch to dinner.\n\nThe good:\n- This is where I come for wings. They have a great selection of flavors & sauces, and after having wings elsewhere, I came back to Teakwoods. Generally, the wings are big, juicy, and slathered with sauce.\n-Daily specials, always something new\n-Peanuts at your table while you wait\n-TV screens everywhere\n-Live music on the weekends\n-Occasionally they offer Groupon deals- $15 for $30 of food? Yes please!\n-Happy hour specials (though I've never once made it here during their selected times)\n\nThe bad:\n-Drinks. Both alcohol and nonalcoholic drinks here leave much to be desired.\n   * The bartender has a very weak pour on their daily specials, so what looks like a good deal at $3.50 a glass will end up taking you 2x as many drink orders as normal.\n  * I think they use tap water for their teas and drinking water. It taste so horrible, I've had to send drinks back several times and I just don't order them now. If you are thirsty, get a soda.\n-Food quality during lunch hour. You'll have better luck around dinnertime, but slower service. Lunches here have been disappointing about 50% of the time. \n-During sports games, you do NOT want to bring your family here, even if its right after church. It will be super crowded and don't be surprised if you are seated next to a boisterous, foulmouthed gang of disrespectful adults who scream their heads off every goal.\n-Prices jumped 15% after they got voted 'Best of Phoenix' for their wings."
3,"Wanted to try something new so when I saw a Groupon at two for the price of one, I was thrilled.  I almost lost the promotional value though cause I waited till the last minute to book our reservation.  (Make sure you look at Groupon expiration dates). Anywho,  I took the opportunity to turn it into a date night with my hubby.  They had weekend dates available which fit our schedule perfectly. The place was easy to find and was located right off Chandler blvd. We had a group of twelve for our time slot and was considered a large group but everyone was cooperative which made the instructors job easier.  I was a bit nervous but after a few simple instructions, I was aiming and shooting at the target with no problem.  The instructor, Julie made it fun and competitive by adding balloons and zombies as target practice.  It was awesome! I'm proud to say I beat my hubby and had more head shots then he did.  It was an exciting way to spend an hour trying something new! Try it and see!!"
3,"When it comes to book shopping, I'm more of a get-in-and-go type than a browser. I usually go out to buy a book for a specific purpose (e.g., an upcoming trip where I'll have lots of down time), so I appreciate when bookstores lay out books in the front for quick selecting. Borders usually does a really good job of separating out some quick picks by type (new non-fiction, clearance, bestsellers), so it's a good fit for my book shopping style. \n\nI went to this location to pick a book for this upcoming weekend (my husband is taking the AZ bar exam early next week, so I'll have a lot of alone time) and quickly found something that looked interesting on the bestsellers table. The downside of Borders is that the prices are high compared to  buying a book online (my top choice is Amazon.com), but the upside is that it's easier to browse than on Amazon, where I usually find book shopping overwhelming if I don't have a specific book or genre in mind. \n\nThe staff at this particular location are friendly and the parking is definitely ample. There is also a Seattle's Best inside this location, a coffee shop I love, but I didn't buy anything from it on my first visit here."
1,"This place taught me all my basics as a competive swimmer when I was 10 years old although it's difficult to advance they only move up the kids that they like and can be a little biased, but what annoys me is that there is no challenge in the lesson it's way to easy and if competive swimming is really what you like then you need someone to really push you and make you uncomfortable so that you can become a better swimmer although lifetime swim really offered that to me!"
1,Food was ok the burritos come with just meat nothing else. So if you order the chicken burrito you are going to get a tortilla filled with shredded chicken. Their floutas were good I would go back for them especially with their salsa.
3,The green tamales are delicious! LOVE THEM.
2,"While this place is better than most generic, greasy Mexican places that are popular in Phoenix (go figure), the only really great thing here is their carne asada tacos. The horchata is too sweet and kind of bland. Service is okay- they forgot my order but promptly made it when I brought it up to them. The salsa is BAD. It tastes like the pizza sauce that comes in Lunchables."
4,"This is some of the best Mexican food we have ever had.  Its kind of a dive, but at least 12 people came to pick up take out while we ate our food.  It was our first time there, so she offered us samples of some of their top sellers - green chili, red chili, shredded chicken and machata beef.  We had some of each of them and a chicken crisp (quesadilla).  It all tasted homemade. It is all served in foil plates, but who cares when it tastes so good!"
3,"Been here a couple times for the XDC event and I've only ever really seen one track. BUT!!! When I do go, next to the track is a huge lake where people drive their different water vehicles and can do jumps I think if they want to go water skiing. I do get burnt when it's hot but when track doesn't get you burnt?"
3,"I came here for the NHRA Finals on Sunday 10/16/11 and I had a great time. The last time I was out here was about 10 years ago for some Top Fuel Hydro races and honestly, not a lot has changed (except for pricing lol). \nAlso I think every ticket is eligible for pit area access now. Years ago you had to purchase a pit pass if you wanted to check that section out. If you do decide to visit the pit area be sure to stand behind a Dragster or Funny Car when they start it up. Its one of the coolest things you'll ever experience although its not recommended for the faint of heart. Once that NitroMethane fills the air around you your eyes, nose and throat immediately start to burn. It wears off pretty fast but its funny to see everyone running towards fresh air while coughing ( I won't lie, I was one of them).\n My overall experience was amazing although its probably better to go during the February races, due to the fact that its still pretty hot out there in October. \nBe sure to bring enough cash because everything is pretty pricey but thats to be expected. I think a large beer was about $9.50. GEEZUS!!! Oh and also plan on spending a good half hour trying to get out of there after the races. If you're not in a hurry to leave try to stick around because traffic is a nightmare right after the final race. You can waste some time by going down on the track, which, by the way is really, really sticky (one of my shoes almost fused to the track :D). Or you can buy some discounted food and drink but its definitely not a good idea to leave right away."
4,"Played it for a tournament and the enviroment was great! Played the Cat Tail course and had a blast. Conditions were great and staff was accomodating and nice. Received a \""free play \"" voucher for the casino and ended up with 40 dollars more so all in all it was great day! Will return soon to play devils claw!"
2,"Loved the system they used for the midnight showing of Dark Knight, and I would not be surprised if all theaters start using this method.  They were showing the movie on 8 screens, and had about 3 auditoriums open by 9pm, so people could just walk right in any of them and pick their seat.  No waiting in line!   My main complaint would be the temperature.  I am used to theaters usually being a little on the chilly side, but this one was way warm.  It was also disappointing that there was no pre-show entertainment\\ads whatsoever.  It was a black screen up until the previews started.  I imagine this had something to do with the fact that they were busy with showing one movie on 8 screens, but I was quite bored with the black screen and wanted them to show some cool stuff to keep me entertained like Cinemark Theaters does.  Overall the experience was fine but nothing special."
0,"I don't know what it is about this place, but they are bound and determined to get your order wrong. I don't know how many times I have come here and asked for no lettuce and every flippin time , there is lettuce! I have had to drive all the way back from San Tan Valley a few times to have them correct an order on other things as well. Just make sure you check your bag before you leave the drive thru or you will have to come back. And the drive thru is SUUUUUPPEERRR SLOW!!! You figure all the time they take preparing your order, they could at least get it right. I actually have a picture that I posted on fb of one particular order  that said on the reciept, \""No lettuce\"" and guess what is just raining out of the wrapper all over my vehicle? LETTUCE!!! There is no excuse for service that slow, that can't even get the order right. I haven't been back there in about 2 years and won't go back. I'd rather drive all the way to Casa Grande to get my fix of tasty KFC chicken. And don't get me started on the Taco Bell side of things at this location.... Bleh!"
3,I've been here a few times now and I must say that I get the best and quickest service in town during a busy lunch hour. They have lunch sized portions at a good price. The wait is less than 10 minutes during lunch. We had a taco salad and a enchilada style burrito. Cost was less than $15.00 for the meal with water as drink of choice. Thursdays after 2pm until 4ish they have a 1/2 price special on some of their menu items. My only negative is that the place could feel a little cleaner.
0,"I am sorry to have to give this place a bad review but my experience last night was pretty bad.\n\nI ordered food to go, it cost me around $11 bucks for a plate.  I ordered cashew chicken and got 4/5 hot.\n\nI get the food home and was starving at this point.  The entree was basically soup; so soupy it was very messy to eat!  Not much chicken, good degree of hotness, too many onions, and I swear there were no cashews.  The white rice also didn't taste right to me, but that's easy to get wrong.\n\nAfter I ate it all I was still hungry and basically NOT very satisfied.  For $11 bucks I would have done better to eat panda express if I was craving some sort of asian.\n\nThe best part?  I believe they use MSG or too much salt or something, after eating I developed a severe headache which I went to bed with.  After drinking tons of water I hoped it would be better in the morning.  I was dead wrong.  This morning I woke up with a migraine and the same salty taste in my mouth that I can't get rid of from last night; I've never been sensitive to headaches in the past but today is simply unbearable.\n\nFor the money I would definitely advise avoiding this place.  Sorry Mint Thai!"
3,I've been there several times trying various menu items and all have been good. The Chicken Fried Rice (I always start with this on my 1st time in) was flavorful and had lots of chicken and vegetables. I have moved on to Pepper Steak and Mongolian Beef and a few others and they have all been quite tasty.
3,Last time I was here I ordered the sesame chicken and scallop beef. I enjoyed the sesame chicken and the only thing that I didn't like about the scallops and beef where the scallops where just plain. Make sure if you pay with your ATM card they don't use it as credit like they did with me when I asked for debit so I wouldn't get charged credit card fees.
2,"As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as \""OK\""... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down."
3,"I've found my new hair stylist in Julie!  My husband surprised me with a spa package for Mother's Day.  What a treat!  Julie did my hair, manicure and pedicure; Kayla gave me a wonderful massage and Dana gave me a real treat with a facial.  It was the first time I had a facial and I definitely want to treat myself again.  The spa is clean and everyone is friendly.  Saturdays are busy in the nail area, so come early."
0,"Hubby and I used to come here all the time and we've always had good experiences. Lately when I've been on that side of town and wanted sushi, I'd go to Temari, remembering how good it used to be.\n\nNot anymore -- I made excuses for their decline in standards.\n\nI'm not sure if that sushi chef was being trained, etc, but the rolls were a bit off -- they fell apart easily and the fish just didn't taste as fresh as I remember it being. The rice for the sushi tended to fall apart far too easily -- that was pissing me off. I had more rice in my soy sauce dipping bowl than on the actual sushi roll itself. Yea, I was pretty peeved, but that was nothing compared to what had happened minutes before...\n\nTheir sushi menu is a bit confusing as well. I am used to a menu where you can check things off on the left hand side of the column, not the far right. I made the mistake of checking the box off to the left, thinking I was ordering california rolls and an eel roll. Imagine my surprise when sashimi arrived instead of nigiri.\n\nThey charged me for my mistake. It was an honest mistake and frankly, I love sashimi, but I've recently had a bad experience with sashimi in California that left me feeling like I was hovering close to death...I was in zero mood for raw fish. What should have cost me about $18 in sushi ended up being $30 for my mistake...lunch there used to cost me somewhere between $15-$20, including tip. When all was said and done, the bill was $42 for 2 people...and my cousin hadn't even ordered sushi!\n\nMy cousin had ordered the chicken teriyaki which she said tasted like they had just straight out added corn flour to soy sauce. She said she'd never had a bigger salt lick in her life. The chicken was overcooked and the only thing I *think* she enjoyed was the salad on her plate...oh and the rice that came with the meal.\n\nThe end of the meal came with complimentary ice cream -- as if that could make me think about coming back here again.\n\nThe service was fine, but I found the tables a bit sticky...like they didn't wipe it down well enough. I had forgotten how cramped it felt in there until I stepped through the doors.\n\nSayonara Temari...you lost a once faithful customer. I discovered Sakana and Four Seasons."
4,Fantastic place for sushi in the east valley! Been going there for a few years now and have always had a great experience! My wife lived in Japan for 4 years and says it reminds her of the little sushi restaurants in Japan. The waitresses are always extremely nice...great place. Quality of fish is great! Rolls are fat and they always seem to have special rolls to challenge your taste buds. Highly recommended!
3,"Yum! Temari does sushi right! They have other items on their menu, but I've only had their sushi. The flavors in each roll are so unique, we ordered 3 rolls: spicy tuna, lollipop roll and their version of a volcano roll. \n\nWe have never tasted anything as good as these rolls. Very fresh fish, amazing taste, and the service was very nice too.\n\nThe place is pretty small, so expect a tight squeeze, but definitely worth while."
1,"The food is good but I do not understand how no one has addressed how slow and disorganized they are here. Still sitting here an hour later and we haven't gotten all of our food. Staggering is one thing but the first two came out after about 20 minutes, the third after 40 minutes and still no sight of the fourth. We've asked to close out and cancel the forth and there wasn't even an acknowledgement or apology for the wait. No prices for most of the rolls on the menu either and they don't itemize the bill. The table next to us was overcharged. Hopefully this is a bad night for this small business because the experience has not been a good one and I'd hate to see them go out of business because they're not adequately staffed."
0,"I took my cat in because he was obviously sick from something and they have a free exam for new clients. The veterinarian performed the exam and then explained to me that she thought it may be possible that he had swallowed a string, which was blocking his intestines. After attempting multiple times to convince me to pay for all the x-rays and possibly surgery, I ended up only purchasing the fluid shots because he hadn't been eating. \n   Before leaving, she tried to scare me into it one more time by saying that if he did not improve, that I should consider euthanasia. This offended me EXTREMELY considering that she had no idea what exactly was wrong, and that all she wanted was for me to hear that and decide to spend more money. I will never, no matter what, return to Val Vista Animal Hospital based solely on this experience.\n   Also, my cat is now perfectly healthy and needed no medical attention whatsoever."
0,"I will not recommend this vet. It is here to take your money. There are worse veterinary clinics than this one such as Arizona Veterinary Specialists. Their prices are lower. However when your vet needs emergency, one of ours did, you expect Your vet to take over when they are open. This is especially true, when the emergency vet (AVS) is charging thousands of dollars just for an IV drip and specialized (Level X) care. This care happens to be a metal fence in a backroom. \n\nThink carefully before you use them. I'd suggest using low cost vet and making sure that you keep animals healthy by regular dental cleaning and shots."
0,"Two words: bug infestation. \n\nPrior to tonight I would have given this restaurant at least 4 stars because I have been to this location through their drive through a couple times and they got my order right, were very friendly, and the prices were always good because I receive coupons in the mail. After tonight though, I'll probably never return. \n\nMy husband (this review is being written by Stephen's wife, Celeste, by the way) and I decided to take our two kids with us for an inexpensive family meal out, especially because we had received more great El Pollo coupons. Well we had never eaten inside the store and didn't realize we would be sharing our dining experience with hundreds of small and unwelcome guests. They were literally everywhere and even though I wiped off the table and chairs before we sat down my husband still had one get on him. He was so grossed out that he couldn't finish his meal (and he's not usually very squirmy about bugs).  All my 2 yr old son could keep saying during the meal was \""bug! bug!\"" as he pointed at the floor or tables. \n\nThe service was still very friendly, but our bag of chips was very stale (they did replace them when I mentioned it though), and the place was generally filthy. I really hope that their food prep area is a lot cleaner than their guest dining area, because if the dining area is any indication of the kitchen I'll be very surprised if we didn't ingest a few bugs. It's too bad because I think If they would just keep it clean they would get a lot more service (certainly we would be return customers if it were cleaner, but will not be now)."
1,"I came to this shop because Discount Tire broke a stud while changing my tire. Discount pays for this repair only through Network. This will be the only reason I ever come back to this shop.\nI have been here in the past for repairs. Customer service is terrible and front desk is very unorganized. The first two repairs I had at this shop were fine. I came back for a air conditioning problem. Network told me that I needed a new air compressor at $1500. I didn't have the money at the time and chose to hold off on the repair. I ended up going to another shop for a second opinion and estimate. The other shop found the compressor was perfectly fine it was a bad seal on the compressor. I paid under a $100 for part and labor, I also was taken into the bay, shown and explained the problem. Network is a joke and embarrassment to the honest automotive shops."
3,Great pizza and wings !! get delivery from here at least 3 times a month definitely recommend it
4,Service is a little slow sometimes but very relaxed.  Food is very good and the combo for lunch is very creative and tasty.  My wife and I like a lot of their dishes but I have to go back each time and have their Yellow Curry Chicken.  It's great!\nIf you need a quick/fast food place then go to the burger joint.  I do recommend this place for their food.
0,"If you think Filiberto's is good food, then you will like this place.\nFish tacos were dry and as tasteless as the lukewarm beans and that fluffy rice thing.  I love Gilbert and want to support the mom and pop's but this is not good.\nHow has this place been around so long is beyond me.  I've driven by it for years and figured it must be great so finally gave it a try.  Bummer."
2,First time here. In and out within 30 minutes. I usually HATE going to my oil changed because they try to get you to buy everything- esp when they see a young girl and let's face it I don't know anything about cars- the man was very nice and even took my word - no means no. Painless. Thanks!
0,"Very disappointing. Originally came to restaurant on a recommendation and was impressed, but after 5 years away i did not like the changes. The place has turned into a dive bar, and the servers are truly crabby. It is impossible to tell who is a guest and who is a server. The food is mediocre, service and atmosphere terrible. I will stay away from this restaurant and would advise others to do the same."
0,Sat for 20 minutes and never got served. Crabby Don's should be Crappy Don's. Left for Mexican restaurant across the street.
0,"HORRIBLE customer service!! After 10 years of my 5 children seeing them and hoping each time they might be more friendly or accommodating, but continuing because we live so close. We are done with you Mesa Pediatrics! We are paying customers with great insurance, you could care less. We are taking our money elsewhere!"
3,"A Jamba Juice is a Jamba Juice is a Jamba Juice. If you have ever been to one before, you know what you are getting yourself into. Lots of fresh fruits and some baked goods. Jamba is one of my favorite places to grab a quick breakfast on the go. Try their oatmeal. It's great.\n\nThe special thing I have to add about this location is the great customer service. I really wanted to try the new Apples 'n Green, but I am allergic to mangoes. (Evil, evil mangoes) When the Jamba Juice guy saw my disappointed face, he told me it was no problem to hold the mangoes. Now that I know this, I can try all the smoothies I want! Thanks, Jamba Juice employees."
2,"An improvement over my last mexican meal here in Arizona, but just pretty average.  The chicken burrito was ALL chicken inside, not spiced or seasoned, just cooked chicken.  A bit dry as well.  The green chile sauce over the top was outstanding and the moist tortilla made up for the insides sort of sucking wind.  Tacos were a weird deep fried flour tortilla.  Not so good.  The tostada shell was soggy.\n\nGood service and nice decor, but just OK food."
4,Awesome food
3,"Yum! Wasn't expecting this to be as good or as nice atmosphere wise. With a name like nando's was comparing it to filly bees, much better! Homemade chips and salsa. As a vegetarian I seriously appreciate the ability to order tacos, burrito, or chimichangas with veggies or potatoes! Plus you can't beat pitchers of Dos Equis! I took off a star because their guacamole tastes like it comes from a package. This place gets enough business to use real guacamole. Worth a taste if you're in the area!"
4,"If you like a good \""hole in the wall,\"" and really excellent high quality food, you will love the China Pearl. The food there is very well made and they use very high quality ingredients. If you go, be sure to ask for the salt and pepper shrimp (not on the menu) and be ready for a real treat."
4,Dr. Driggers is amazing. I have two Uromastyx who he has examined and I wouldn't trust their care to anyone else. No complaints.
3,"Excellent food at an affordable price.  If Mexican fast food is your scene, there are few rivals to Filiberto's.  In my former life as a fast food aficionado, I found myself daily at the drive-thru window of Fliberto's ordering breakfast burritos.  All varieties excellent!  Huge burritos overflowing with yummity goodness.  Nothing hits the spot like breakfast at Filiberto's.  Now that I have reformed my ways of eating to embrace a healthier lifestyle, I still find that there are yummity healthy options like the pollo asado burrito minus the tortilla.  The salsa verde is excellent.  You can switch your flour tortillas for corn tortillas and ask for grilled options.  I have shopped around and still think Filiberto's is one of a kind.  Eat well. Be well."
3,"Been going here quite a few times lately. Enjoyed every visit overall. The Maiden Lane?(turkey sandwich), Arizona Sky and Minestrone were all delicious. The sloppy joe could have been better. Too much bun and not enough slop.\n\nThe creamy potato salad was weak. Very bland and flavorless.On the other hand the roasted sweet potato salad was quite the opposite. Could not get enough of it. Was really disappointed the last time I went and they were sold out.\n\nStaff has been nothing but great each visit."
3,"Wow, what a cool place! I went for the first time last night and had the farmer sandwich, it was fabulous. Service was great. Love the atmosphere and vibe here. The patio is especially nice when the weather is right. The menu is just salads, sandwiches and pizzas but if that's what you're looking for, give it a try.  I highly recommend Liberty Market."
3,This is as good as it gets in Arizona.  We had a great time eating lunch in the really lovely place.  Joe who owns the place chatted us up and was just great.  He made us a great expresso drink and charmed everyone at the table.  It felt like I was in LA or San Francisco.  What a great little place!!! I only get to AZ a few times a year but will make a effort to stop by every time.
3,"Wow it really took me this long to actually try Liberty Market, really!?!?!? What was I thinking! I have been missing out on this place for way too long. And to find it now, just when my company is moving and it was sooo close!!!!\n\nOk, sorry enough of my whining! This place is just WOW! The food looked amazing; the dessert looked way too good! And the taste did not disappoint either.\n\nMy friend and I went to lunch today at Liberty Market, I was at first surprised by the line to order, it was LONG! But the way they seat people is really ingenious; by the time you are done ordering you have a table waiting. Pretty cool!\n\nWe ordered the Picnic Sandwich, which was very flavorful. My favorite part was the crisp green apples, which added great texture. A little blue cheese, some turkey, it was really well put together.\n\nWe also ordered the White pizza, which was very tasty! The crust was nice and crispy and the pine nuts were an excellent addition. Oh and don't forget dessert, no I really mean it, DON'T forget dessert....well I guess you can if you are on a diet or something. We had the Red Velvet Cake, YUM!\n\nI think Liberty Market really has taken the cafeteria style dining and made it a well-organized machine; I am so impressed by this place. What took me so long to get here, I ask myself again!"
0,"This is the first and unfortunately last time I will be visiting the Liberty Market. My idea of a good breakfast is good service and an enjoyable, relaxing time, all three of which I did not experience during my visit. \n\nThe place is utter chaos. When you walk in you think that there are available tables, but then someone comes over to you and lets you know that she is \""seating the table right now\"", and you can order and she will find you a place to sit. That's fine, but a sign near the door stating, \""please wait to be seated\"" would solve about 99% of the \""hostess\"" running around and rearranging people, and 100% of the confusion for first time visitors. They would almost serve themselves better by letting people seat themselves....It was stressful enough to watch the poor girl run around trying to seat people. \n\nOn that note, I saw her let people sit down until she had to seat a party, then she made them get up and stand, which I thought was incredibly rude. She also seated my party of two, and after we sat down, SHE MOVED US! To a smaller table. Fine, we are only a party of two, but once you make up your mind on where you are going to seat a party, keep it, its rude to make them move after they have been seated. \n\nWe ordered our food, I got the Chorizo Quesadilla...good, but nothing great that I couldn't get at other establishments. We even commented to each other how the food should be outstanding...it must be for us to want come back, but again, it was nothing to rave about. \n\nThe food took a long time, and the place is LOUD. The busers are around in flurries setting up and taking down tables, but it's beyond impossible to flag one down to get a box for your food at the end of the meal. \n\nWe left more stressed out then full in our bellies. Granted we visited on a busy Sunday morning, but customer service should always be a companies top priority, here it wasn't. I felt like we got nothing but a stressful expensive meal instead. I rated Liberty Market \""fairly\"" at one star, because like the rating says, I think not. I would not visit again, nor would I recommend to my family or friends."
2,"My never-ending quest for amazing breakfasts led me to Liberty Market yesterday. This place is cool and shiny in a stainless steel, bedazzled, old farmhouse sort of way. The atmosphere is definitely the main thing the place has going for it-- always packed, always lively, new and hip. I also give it props for using obviously fresh, local produce and meat. \n\nThat being said, the breakfast didn't blow me away. I got a traditional combo of scrambled eggs, turkey sausage and a blueberry pancake. My date ordered the veggie scramble with a buttermilk biscuit and homefries. The pancake was delish-- super light and fluffy but the eggs and sausage were kind of lacking in flavor. Same went for my date's, though he said the biscuit was the best he's ever had and I'd have to agree. All this, plus their yummy display of desserts by the order counter, leads me to believe that Liberty Market knows how to bake but needs to add a bit of spice to its cooking. If I ever find myself in the boonies again, I would hit this place up (if only because there's not a whole lot of other options.)"
4,"I tried the white pizza and picnic sandwich.  The pizza was the best white pizza I've had anywhere, and the sandwich was very fresh.  I look forward to trying breakfast here."
0,"If you want to pay $4 for a cup of chicken broth, by all means, this is your place. I was excited to try this place because I love Joe's BBQ. I heard that they gave you a free meal ($10) on your birthday so I thought that would be a good time to try it out. I was out with a friend and she watched our kids in the car so I could run in and get the food and take it back home. Well after I placed my order, the cashier  told me I could only get a birthday meal if I was eating it there, but that I could have a dessert free. She said they had been having problems with it and had to change the rule. So, I ended up feeling like an annoyance to them on my birthday. I waited 15 minute for them to scoop and package a bowl of tortilla soup and when I got home and tried it I was so disappointed! It had no chicken or vegetables in it! Seriously? $4 for a cup of chicken broth? I will not be going back."
3,"Went on a Saturday morning for brunch, we waited a bit to order and get our food, but it was so organized and the system they use for ordering (while you're in line, someone assigns you a table, after you order they escort you to your table and then bring you your food when it's ready) and food delivery is so smooth you don't sweat it. I ordered their specialty pizza slice (GREAT!) and my husband had an egg/breakfast meal, I tasted and it was delicious. Can't wait to come back."
2,Grew up in Phoenix but spent the last 10 years in LA where my food expectations have skyrocketed. I thought this place would still offer viable competition but the food was just okay. I think it's perfect for the audience so it's smart business making but nothing really exciting or original is going on here. They've stuck  to the basics and do well so can't fault them for that. \n\nDesserts are strong. The Salted River bar and the fruit tart were delicious.
3,The place gets pretty crowded. The people working there were friendly. I tried one of their favorites - Picnic with sweet potato salad. The sandwich was very good. The salad on the other hand was simply too salty to go with the sandwich.
3,"Great food, always fresh and innovative items on the menu. The staff is very friendly and attentive to what's going on. I also like that much of their produce comes from local sources."
4,"Wow, what a nice surprise! My wife had the flatiron steak, and I had the special \""three amigos\"" burger with chorizo, cheddar, and jalape\u00f1o. Everything was cooked to perfection and DELICIOUS. Don't miss it if you are in the area!"
4,"Kristen and the rest of the Liberty Market staff were so friendly! All the food looks unreal, atmosphere is fantastic, even down to the bathrooms. Definitely stop by if you're in the area."
0,Unbelievably uninspiring breakfast. Chilaquiles was cold so I got the biscuits and gravy. Dry biscuits and gravy under seasoned and lacking flavor. I have never posted a review on yelp but this meal was so bad I felt I had to. Nothing original on the breakfast menu..will not return.
0,"First time at Liberty and the last, it was expensive 29.00 for two people for a stack of pancakes with ice cold syrup and a side of 2 pieces of cold sausage, 2 scrambled ice cold dry eggs 1 saus. link and a dry biscuit, no butter/honey 1cup of regular coffee that they didn't bring the cup till after I got my breakfast and 1 apple juice. I think $29.00 is expensive for that plus it was all cold. When I told the waiter he responded with \""Oh my bad\"" what the heck is that suppose to mean. Never again....."
4,"Hands down can not get enough! Atmosphere, food, employees, and location! one word BOMB!!!"
3,Get fuel here! Yay!
0,"DON'T USE THIS STATION!!!!! THEY PUT $126.00 CHARGE ON YOUR CREDIT CARD!!!!!!  I just got off the phone with them, as I thought someone had stolen my card when I saw my charge for $18.31 (I topped off my tank and bought a $7 car wash) and then another one for $126.00.  That's ridiculous!!!!!!!  This was NOT a debit card (I do understand putting a hold on those to make sure you don't spend the money before their charge goes through) but there is NO warning sign or anything.  I will NEVER go there again....my car won't even hold more than $50 worth of gas, and you'll have the actual charge as WELL as the $126 charge on there until they decide to take it off.  NEVER, NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!"
1,"Judging by the 5-star reviews this place has I can come to only 1 conclusion.... the people reviewing this place have NO concept of good sushi.\n\nI've been here a few times, most recently for the $18.95 All-You-Can-Eat sushi deal.  The AYCE deal is a rip off.  They only let you order 3 items at a time, have a very limited menu to choose from, take 20-25mins between orders, and they physically make the sushi different.... meaning when they fill an AYCE order they give you a huge lump of rice topped with a razor thin slice of fish.  When you order from the non AYCE menu they serve a proper nigiri.  Bullshit.\n\nNon-AYCE speaking their food is nothing to get excited about.... their rolls are sloppy and are boring.  The fish is not that good and frankly didn't taste of superior quality.  The atmosphere is loud, bright, and full of televisions.\n\nIf you have never left Gilbert and think Safeway has \""bomb sushi\"", well you will be in heaven here.... otherwise you would be well advised to seek sushi somewhere else."
1,A good place for kids. There is a play area. The pizza was not very bland/generic. If you want good pizza this is not the place.
0,"Warning...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS PLACE.  Just moved here, my boyfriend made an appointment first due to scheduling issues and I couldn't believe it when he came home and told me how this place conducts business.  He told them not to dilate his eyes as he wasn't having problems and the receptionist (not a nurse or doctor) told him HAD to do it.  Then at checkout even though he was only trying the contacts they collected money and ordered contacts instead of waiting until he went back for a follow-up to confirm that the contacts were the correct ones for him.  Sure enough a few days later he couldn't wear them, when he went back for his follow-up, they gave another kind to try.  I wasn't very impressed when he said they office staff was totally different and he saw a different doctor as well.  They didn't bother to set a follow-up so I've been waiting for a prescription or call for follow-up but apparently since they've already collected money from us and the insurance they were done.\n\n Finally today I had had enough of the foolishness and went to get a copy of the prescription, only to hear it had never been \""finalized\"" by the doctor because there had never been a follow-up appointment.  I was absolutely appalled by the attitude of the \""receptionist\"" when I pointed out they had never set an appointment or called, of course she was maybe 19 and acted like she had no common sense.  I demanded a refund of the money collected the day of the appointment for the contacts as there were never any contacts purchased.  According to the office manager,  they had used up the majority of the insurance benefit between the \""fitting\"" and other services rendered and if they refunded any money we would have to pay for the fitting fee.  \n\nFinally I told them I know what they are doing is wrong, just as they do, which will be reported to the insurance; however, I'd rather go to a professional eye doctor and pay out of pocket for my boyfriend to have eye exam.  This office is obviously just looking to screw people out of money and don't care if they have to lie to do it."
0,"Zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures. Office manager argues and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place, nor will I ever schedule another appointment. Go to Lenscrafters if you have Tricare/United Healthcare."
2,"I've frequented this location a couple times & I've never had an issue with them, service or food wise. I just enjoyed a peanut buster parfait & it was just like the picture, how many restaurants can say that!, lol  when I'm in the mood for DQ & I'm in the area I'll stop in here for a bite"
3,"A very tasty place for breakfast.  I strenuously object to any place that doesn't serve hash browns, but really that's my only complaint.  They have a ton of different omelets/scrambles (you choose) and you can make your own.  Example: spinach tomato sausage bacon with american cheese.  As a scramble.  With salsa.  The coffee is good (I hear from my wife) and the cinnamon roll is a real treat.  Not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8.5/10.  \n\nIt is true that there can be a very long wait so plan ahead for sure.  You'll be waiting outside.  \n\nThey grill their wheat toast-solid."
1,"Breakfast chow was okay, but the friendly service was tarnished by 1) no menu 2) failure to meet my order and 3) no effort to ask, \""How's your breakfast?\""\n\nPROS: they had egg whites instead of Egg Beaters, which was better than having to do regular eggs; turkey sausage was also available, but the flavor was meh; hash browns were very good--crispy outside, soft inside; neat establishment in Old Town Gilbert, w/ high ceilings, wood floors, etc. Staff were friendly, but . . .  \n\nCONS:  received a cheerful, \""Sit wherever you want!\"", then waited for a menu. Five minutes passed, and I was offered a beverage. When the drink was delivered, I was asked for my order. Ummm . . . I waived off the menu and placed an ala carte request.  I also asked if they had salsa. The response was a cheerful, \""Yes and it's homemade! It's good!\""  My plate arrived -- I never saw any salsa . . . nor my waitress for that matter, until it was time to deliver the bill (albeit with a cheerful demeanor, which I did appreciate). My last rant? The 70s music piped into the dining area. I hate Chicago--always have. The follow-on dose of Boston and The Spinners did not improve the ambiance for me . . . The silver lining? The theme from \""Shaft\"" came on as I was about to leave! \""He's one bad mutha f-- . . . Shut yo mouth! . . . I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft! . . . We can dig it!\"" I stayed and listened. Then made a hasty exit as the radio segued to Kansas. YUCK!\n\nThe Farmhouse is a neat looking place, and the chow is satisfactory, but my service was lacking.  Lastly, the tunes were like fingernails on a chalboard to me (w/ one notable exception).  I think I'll try another establishment next time I am in town.\n\nCheers!\nRS"
1,"Overall I just wasn't super impressed with this place.  I heard good things about it, so I decided to brave the very long wait...which is always present and eat breakfast here.  The food was decent, don't get me wrong, but there was nothing that truly stood out to me and it's quite crowded.   Sorry, but I would rather go to the Gilbert House down the street any day."
0,"This restaurant has a sign up sheet outside the front door. It is very easy to keep tabs of our placement on the list. There were several names ahead of us when we signed in. Our family of 5 looked forward to breakfast. After waiting 45 minutes one couple was ahead of us.When the bus boy seated that couple, he also seated a couple who had just arrived, placing them at a large table for 5 or 6 people. It turns out one of the members of the couple was his brother. We complained to the manager about preferential seating of the second couple ahead of us. She would not acknowledge the problem or offer an apology. Instead she made excuses pointing to a previous customer name to cover up their mistake. Either she is clueless or a liar. We left and went to Biscuits and had a great meal. \n\nIf i could give this restaurant zero stars, I would have. The rudeness was an insult!"
1,Eggs where runny. Yolks where raw. Asked for a diet soda as I am diabetic and can't have juice. The waitress never brought my cold drink and thus I had to attempt to wash my hot food down with my hot coffee. I choked profusely. The waitress did her best to avoid our table with having had only 3 visits to our table. Once for drinks then taking our order and last to give us the check. No tip no return for us. Is customer srvc. Dead???
1,"Good cleaning, but way overpriced! I tried to negotiate a deal with the owner for regular dry cleaning (I clean about 40 pieces/month) and was shot down. Her excuse: We pay way too much for coupons and advertising. OK... I asked for the coupon price on the 20 pieces I had there and was refuted once again. Goodbye $120/month steady business???"
1,"I would love to tell you how the food was here.  I would be thrilled if I could write an 8 page diatribe that makes you drool because I describe the various tastes so well.  But I can't.\n\nWe hit this up on the recommendation of a friend on a Friday night.  Of course it's Friday in Gilbert, so we know it might be a little busy, but only one group was waiting when we got there. \n\nWe walk in and wait, and someone comes up to us and says \""2? It will be a few, what's your name\"" and then walks off after putting our name on the list.  I grab 2 menus and we start to wait.\n\nThe food must be great here, because the place was packed!  We watched, stomachs growling as plate after loaded plate was set out for delivery to the dining masses. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, we decided to grab a seat outside, as we kept getting trampled by the staff (it's not a big place.)  We sit, and see that there are now quite a few people waiting, all but the one group having arrived well after we did.   And then the magic moment came, several groups had finished their meal and were on their way!\n\nThe group before us (about 5 or 6 people) were seated, and we continued to patiently wait.  At this point it had been 20 minutes, which in my mind exceeds the \""a few\"" we were quoted upon arrival, but we were willing to be chill and wait it out.\n\nThen....(insert dramatic mood music here) a server came out and called a name on the list.....it was not my name, and no one in the line responded to it.  She called it a few more times, and someone who just walked in 5 minutes before stood up and said did you call Becky (name changed to protect the stranger) - not even close.  The server said \""No, but come on anyhow\"" and allowed this person to jump the line.  At that point we had enough hunger and thirst and went elsewhere.\n\nI cut a LOT of slack to servers, especially when they are busy, but the attitude and the service we saw in the 20 plus minutes of simply waiting left us cold.  I'd be willing to go back and give them a try, but I might pack a snack first."
2,"I've eaten here twice.  The 1st time I wanted to give it 5 stars & my wife leaned towards 4 stars.  Very nice ma & pa type place, friendly staff, fairly quick service, excellent selections.  The second time we went back the food was far less desirable, maybe it was the cook, I don't know.  I will probably go back again, I really Want to think the 2nd visit was the fluke and not the 1st visit."
0,"I am honestly shocked by the amazing reviews for this restaurant. We read them and went with such high expectations of amazing food and atmosphere. Maybe it was our fault we were so let down, but we won't make the mistake of going here ever again. \n\nWe walked in to find that it was a complete dive. Flies were buzzing about and servers were standing around bored. It just seemed so dirty and unkempt. Ok... maybe the food would blow us away...\n\nWe read reviews on the fabulous fresh baked bread so we knew we had to order sandwiches. My sandwich was mostly dry, shredded iceberg with a blob of mayo, dry turkey that looked like it met its fate under a lawnmower. Thank god I paid extra for avocado and bacon.... because those were the only things I could taste at all. The bread was so BLAND and plasticky. It was just... not good. And it was beyond expensive for what we got. \n\nIf you have a palate more sophisticated than that of a 4 year old, this is not the place for you."
4,"The sandwiches and fries don't get any better!  Homemade bread, beer battered fries...and the nicest servers around. Oh, and HUGE cups with speedy refills IF you ever need them.\n\nThe Gilbert location is small and nothing fancy - but it's always a good time at Flancers!  The Mesa location (newer, bigger - not as good food IMO)\n\nI almost always get the Prickly Pear sandwhich - - they marinate the chicken in some secret sauce and it is just so so good.  My husband almost always gets the Phily cheesesteak which he says is one of the best he's ever had.\n\nSometimes there is a wait and be advised, the waiting area is usually OUTSIDE. But if you must cram with the other patrons in the AC, they will be awesome Gilbert folks so it isn't all that bad:)"
4,"My husband and I love Flancer's!  We've tried several sandwiches and salads, as well as a few of the appetizers.  Everything has tasted great!  The service is good, the waitstaff friendly and they have tv's if you don't want to miss the game.  If you are looking for some good food, in a casual, relaxed atmosphere from a local business, then I would highly recommend this place."
1,"Went to Flancers the first time this last week.  I got the Prickly Pear Caesar Chicken.  I was not a fan.  The dressing didn't taste much like Caesar and while the Prickly Pear flavoring was tasty, it seemed odd for a Caesar.  I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.\n\nMy biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.  I'd visit one more time if I could have a Stella w/ my meal, but with the lager selection, I can scratch them off my list."
2,"My wife and I ordered the goat cheese bruchetta (small size,) a burger, a philly steak and 2 soft drinks. The bill was $37 plus tax. Woah! \nThe other night we went to a bar, ordered 2 burgers, a soft drink, 2 bottles of beer and a large pitcher of beer for a little cheaper. \nThe food was good but nothing memorable. The service and atmosphere was the best part but I will not be back until the prices are lower."
1,C'mon folks. Anyone going more than 3 stars here is being silly.\n\nThis is about on par with Filibertos except in a much dirtier environment. Dusty non air conditioned dining area with super uncomfortable seating. This is a very LDS style hodge podge of a dining area. Whatever could be found at the Thrift store if I had to guess.\n\nNice people working there though. Don't expect a conversation however if you are from out of town. People in this part of AZ are very very dry.
4,Love this little Mexican burrito shack! The carnesada is good! I love the beans and rice too!
4,Best burritos I've ever tasted from NV to AZ! Seriously can't find anywhere comparable
0,Everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad Food Poisoning and almost die!!!!
2,"My group met here for a motorcycle ride. I'm rating breakfast only. It was decent. I had your basic combo of two eggs over medium hash browns, bacon and wheat toast w/coffee. My eggs were cooked perfectly. My bacon was just right. I don't know what it is about cooking hash browns but they cook one side so you eat the crunchy stuff and leave the rest. The coffee was hot and always full. The service was fast and friendly.\nDon't expect squeaky clean but not hazardous to your health."
0,"This course has an ok layout and a couple holes with nice views, however it doesn't make up for a rude staff that pushed us every other hole to keep a faster pace. They talked down to us and were being rude. Not even one \""hello, are you having a good time?\""  No courtesy at all, just rudeness. On a Sunday early morning we maintained a 4 1/2 hr pace while having to search for our balls in monsoon casual water collection areas and high rough. We let a 3 some play through and were not pushed much from behind, yet the staff kept harrassing us and threatening to make us skip a hole. What?? I have never had this experience at another course even if there was slow play that day.  Here, it wasn't even crowded yet they kept annoying us. What an unenjoyable day and waste of gas money to drive all the way out there.  Never again.  The 1 star is just for 3 nice holes on the mountainside, otherwise i'd try giving negative stars."
1,"Great course! However the locals (old people that could only afford to live on a golf course in BFE) think they run the place. The bartenders are pretty rude, as are the annoying messages they send your cart every hole (ex. Keep up with the group ahead... The same group you are caught up w and waiting on). They definitely over schedule the Tee times. I will say the course staff (rangers, food service) were great."
1,"Decent coarse, greens were a little fast as they were a little under watered.  The place is definitely a little over priced and snooty for it's location........  You are a golf course in San Tan Valley, the attitude and prices would be expected up in Snottsdale, but not in the middle of the freaking desert...."
0,"Attempted to check this place out tonight because I heard it was good. I'm on travel for business and my company gave me an American Express card for all my expenses. Well after driving down here and just getting ready to order, I ask to make sure they accept Amex and sure enough they don't. Also they don't accept discover cards either so I left. They didn't seem to care."
0,"Awful service! I used to come her back in 2010 when it was new, the food and staff were awsome! I recently came back and the staff is all new. One word... RUDE. Our waitress seemed pestered when id ask for a refill or when id place another order. Like, um, sorry to bother you at work lady? The food was good, but theres a ton of other sushi places in the east valley with the same grade of food and better service. Its a shame this place shot to shi*, could have been a real gem."
2,"In my opinion, a good sushi experience relies heavily on subtleties.  First up, room temperature & vibe.  We were greeted and sat in a corner booth near a window.  Within 1 minute we realized it was hot so we decided to move to an adjacent booth situated under a ceiling fan.  We were promptly told that they might have to move us in case a large party arrived.  I guess I get that.  Seeing the room was 90% empty, I told her half joking that they would have to wait a few minutes since it was our 18th anniversary. Blank stare retort.  Room temp/vibe - FAIL.  Next up, drinks.  An ice cold Sapporo is sort of my go-to with sushi.  It was cold-ish, not co-o-o-ollld. My wife's wine was fine.  Drinks - Meh.  Next up, Appetizers.  Salad - great, miso soup - great, shrimp tempura....wha? More like Sam's club breaded longish shrimp.  We were not served shrimp tempura but I didn't make a fuss since they tasted pretty good.  Edamame were barely warm.  Appetizers - FAIL.  Next up, Entrees.  The rolls were really good, Rainbow, Boston.  Salmon and tuna nigri were really good too. Yellow tail was not.  My wife had beef teriyaki which she said was not good, bland.  Entrees-GOOD!. (I have to cancel out the teriyaki, cuz this is a sushi place.) I can forgive the low par yellow tail too, we ARE in the desert. They really should not have served it, though.  Oh, our server was super nice but not personable or genuine, almost too nice. She did a good job.  Service - GOOD.\n\nOverall, not bad.  I have been here before for carry out rolls and will likely come back for that vs dine in.  I think a little focus could make this quaint place a gem.  They just missed the mark in a few important areas."
1,We used to love this place and would come weekly.  My wife is a regular here and has in the past thought very highly of Mikado.\n\nLately the food quality has dropped quite a bit and the service has suffered.  We aren't sure if we will be coming back.
0,I'm completely baffled on how this got the better review then the  Sushi Room a.k.a. Rock Lobster. We were trying to step out of the box I'm going back in the box. \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly. \n\nThe food was absolutely disgusting. I kind of felt bad because they were nice so we just told them we were full and took it to go. I threw it away in the garbage outside the restaurant and drove to Rock Lobster for takeout. I will not make that mistake again. \n\nThe sushi was so big I couldn't put it in my mouth and it fell apart!  It just tasted terrible plus there was no flavor. I have nothing more to say.
3,"We frequent this location, as it's nearest to our house.  I do agree with other reviews that it's slloooooowwww to check out here.  However, when you do interact with an employee here, all of the employees are very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.  One employee who has helped us quite a bit is Jim.  He's always super helpful, but he can get a bit disheveled when things get busy in there.  Nonetheless, Jim goes above and beyond to ensure you are doing the right thing for your pool and helps in any way he can.  Overall, a decent place to get your pool chemicals, water tested or buy some new floaties."
1,"Normally I have a strict policy against leaving the house on Saturdays due to all the people out running their errands and running over whoever gets in their way, but this morning, Captain Douchebag next door decides to fire up all his power tools at 7:00 a.m., so I thought, what the heck....I'll go out and knock out the stuff on my list.\n\nI had already had a bad experience at Target.  Grabbed a cart, which happened to come with a dirty diaper!  WTF is wrong with people?  Then I got behind a woman who kept trying 14 different maxed out credit cards and it took me forever in the check out lane.  I am not having a good feeling at this point.  I should have gotten a breakfast burrito and immediately gone home.  But I had one more stop that I really wanted to make.  \n\nI had a book on hold at Hamilton Library that I needed for a class, so I thought I'd swing in there a little after 9 and pick it up.  Now, I am the first to admit when I'm wrong, and at the time I truly thought their Saturday hours were 9-5.  I walk in, find my book, and start using the self-checkout.  Suddenly I hear, \""WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!?!?!?!?\""    \n\nUh.....this is a library....I'm not sure what else I'd be doing.  \n\n\""WE ARE NOT OPEN!  HOW DID YOU GET IN?!?!?\""  \n\nI pointed to the door that I always come in, and said, \""The door right there.\""\n\nAn older gal who has the same hairdo Priscilla Presley had when she married Elvis, proceeded to totally attempt to make me feel like an idiot.\n\n\""YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT!\""\n\n\""Do you mean I can't take the book I just checked out?\""\n\n\""DID YOU SEE THE SIGN OUT FRONT?  YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE!!  ARE YOU FINISHED?  OUR HOURS ARE 1-5.  YOU NEED TO GO DOWNTOWN!! WELL GO AHEAD!!\""\n\n\""I'm truly sorry if I startled you, but don't you open at 9?\""  \n\n\""THAT IS THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION ONLY!  THERE'S A SIGN OUT FRONT!  WE ARE NOT OPEN!\""\n\nHer diatribe was filled with many sighs and eye rolls.  Oh boy.  Her Monday-Friday job must be with TSA.  \n\nThen I said something that's just as dorky as saying, \""oopsie daisy\"".  I said, \""Jiminy, I didn't mean to upset you.  Sorry.\""\n\nJiminy.  Oh yeah.  Who says that?  I'm a dork.  She caught me off guard.\n\nMaybe it's because in my day job I frequently have to correct people and I do it in a way that's friendly, at times humorous, and educational so they actually learn.  It's not rocket science, but yelling at and berating people doesn't really tend to work very well.  \n\nNormally I find this location slightly frustrating anyway.  I've learned to avoid the peak high school comings and goings, but they put up a one way only sign for the library parking lot, and if you follow the sign, on weekends, it takes you to a locked gate.  Makes no sense.  So, I have to turn around and go against the one way, which everyone else does anyway because the entrance/exit is right on Arizona Ave.\n\nAs I left, I realized I should have asked her, \""Who left the door unlocked?\"""
4,Great Family owned place to get all of your BBQ supplies!
2,"Best wings ever (besides Zipps Golden wings...)! We order a bucket of hot to go and can't wait to get them home! Other things we've tried aren't the greatest, except for the fried calamari. Super good and not chewy like most I've had. Their new patio is really nice and looking forward to the cold nights when they have the fireplace going."
4,"To start, this is my first Yelp review! So here it goes! \nThis is one of the best \""Dive Bars\"" I've experienced. Great Bartenders, very friendly and attentive! Good beer selection, they have Blue Moon & Kilt Lifter so I approve :). Regular drink prices are not that bad!!  They have HUGE portions of food that I ate way too much of....and also for a really decent price. We started with a 1/2 dozen sweet chili wings. Holy. Moly. Huge wings, and beyond delicious! Next: the burgers. Another Holy. Moly. moment. They had to be at least a 1/2 pounder! I ordered the California Dreamin' Burger with Swiss, Bacon, and Avocado: YUMM!! You can also get this with chicken instead of as a burger, but I just had to splurge! What made this burger even more worth purchasing is that I have the other half of it saved for another lunch or dinner :) The atmosphere is great. Lots and lots of TV's for those sports fans, but they also play non-sports shows too for people like me to be entertained by :) They even have individual TV's at each booth! It is a very clean and fun place to hangout with friends. \n5 stars in my book. Everything about this place was enjoyable!"
3,The food is excellent and the delivery service is outstanding.  They handle everything with a smile. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't good.
3,"Chance encounter on this little (well, maybe not soo little) gem of a place. Yelped it the moment I passed by it because of all the cars present in their parking lot. Although there are only 8 reviews for the place, what people had to say about it really made me want to visit. \n\nWas well greeted on a spontaneous adventure to the restaurant for dinner. The bar was packed so my party decided to get seated in the main dining area. Got seated right away and was introduced to our server in no time. Think she had to swallow a chill pill or something because it took some time for her to be nice (most likely the main reason im not giving this place 5 stars)\n\nThe menu was pretty reasonable. Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 (If Im correct, there is only one item on the menu costing $15) \n\nWe started off with three appetizers, thinking it would be the only dishes ordered (little did we know):\n\n- Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings: Some a little burnt but it tasted great. The portions are large and seasoning just right (or too bland depending on what you prefer). I liked that it was grilled, less of that greasy hell overwhelming the taste of the actual meat.\n\n- Homemade lemon garlic Hummus with pita : sooo delicious. It was only about $6, it comes with a bunch of pita. My party of 4 shared it and still had left overs =] definitely recommended.\n\n- Cheeseburger Sliders x3 on Egg Bun: The bun is delicious! and the meat is perfectly cooked (medium) and seasoned. The perfect balance of meat, bun, and cheese. Comes with diced pickles.\n\nWe were having a jolly time when all of a sudden someone notices a dish being served to the the table next to us. It looked so good, she decided to order it herself. We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out.\n\nThe chicken is juicy and tender the entire way through. No parts of the chicken dry, every bite was well savored and just...mmm mmm mm\nCame with two sides (we chose the green beans/onions and mashed potatoes): green beans weren't my favorite, they were overcooked but the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked, tasted so fresh. They don't use a ton of butter or sour cream which was favorable to my taste buds. \n\nWould definitely come again\n\nFYI: \nhappy hour 3-6:30 pm. From what I could make out on the menu written in chalk: Half off appetizers and three 5.5 oz of draft beer for $5 (normally $6 for 3 - 5 oz beer sampler) oh and something about $5 wine"
4,"I have been going to Connie for about 10 years and she has always been corteous and her prices are very resonable.  I go to her for watch repairs, band replacement, batteries and I got my ring resized.  I would definitely recommend Connie to my family and friends."
0,"OK, so I went back in today to give another shot on having my horrible nails fixed. Epic fail. The lady who did my \""fix\"" was named Jennifer. She seemed very aggitated at me like it was my fault her employee screwed my nails up so bad. While filing my nails with the machine, I had to pull my nail back several times for how harsh she was being. I have never had a fill hurt so bad. To top it all off, she didnt ask me about shape and filed them the way she wanted, which is not the way I like! She went to paint the whole nail and never asked me. I only get tips done. She was throwing my hands and tapping them instead of actually talking to me like a human being. Then they sat me in a chair where I had to sit at a horrible angle to dry the gel topping. I didnt even get so  much as an apology for the bad craftsmanship, At one point she even began pointing at my nails and talking in a language I dont understand, undoubtedly talking bad about me. I get my nails done every 2 weeks and I will spend my money elsewhere. This place is horrible. Not to mention, the salon was very dusty and not maintained well with cleaning."
1,"The last 3 times we tried this, after our initial time (which I can only think was a fluke of luck) our delivery arrived over 2 ours after we ordered it and it was cold, all three times! Why get delivery pizza if it would literally take less time to go to the grocery store and come home and make a pizza from scratch! Very disappointed. \n\nTo top that off, the woman who took our order on two occasions got it wrong and that is after being asked to repeat it back to her several times. She was also rude and impatient and seemed distracted. Maybe that is why she didn't hear our order the first 3 times I said it. This place just isn't worth the hassle, the wait, and the rude customer service."
1,"Their pizza isn't always fantastic if you order a lunch special but thats to be expected since it is a lunch special and it's not cooked right when you order it. \nMy last visit there was pretty bad, as I was halfway through eating my meal, I noticed a couple of cockroaches under a table a few seats down from me.  1 cock roach was dead, the other one was hanging out with his dead buddy.  Needless to say, I may have overreacted a bit, but my food just began to taste awful (Yes I know thats just in my head) and I had to throw my food away and leave.  \n\nI'm sure they'll improve next time but I don't feel as though I'll be returning for a little while."
3,play it.
4,"Played January of 2011($60).This is quite simply the best golf course I have ever played! Water everywhere, I probably left at least a half dozen balls in the lakes and I still had a blast. Homes surround the course, but lakes seperate them and dont really come into play, they actually ad to the beauty of this course. The course was in immaculate condition. I dont play resort golf very often, from the friendly and helpfull cart guys to the bartender, I was very impressed with the service. Troon Golf now has a reputation with me, I will forever compare all courses to this one. Will definately play this course again when I return."
0,"Find a different frys supermarket if possible. This location is really busy.  I have had to complain to management a few times for not having enough registers open,  not enough baggers and not restocking items that are out. Every time it gets better for a couple days but it soon degrades to the same situation."
4,"Cornerstone is what one may call a \""Mega Church\"" and it is mega-sized for sure.  But the interesting thing I have found is that the size of the church actually enables it to be whatever you want it to be.  Sure, you could come to Sunday services every week for a year and never see the same person twice, but if you are looking for a deeper community, there is literally something for everyone.  Be it a class, small church, support group, or other gathering, you can find whatever is right for you for your place in life.  Or if it's the anonymity of a large church you're looking for, that's definitely possible... with smiling faces all around and a really great energy.\n\nCornerstone offers a coffee shop/cafe area, bookstore, a ton of volunteer opportunities, men's ministries, women's ministries, retreats, mission trips, top-tier worship leaders, sermons that dig in to the bible and provide real-life context, and thoughtful kids programs.\n\nYou can feel confident dropping your children off while you're at the service, because they will be cared for by background-checked, well-trained individuals ready to teach your kid the week's bible lesson!  Babies mere weeks old are welcome, and the older kids have fun activities every week.\n\nCheck out a service to see what it's all about, and stop by the information booths for further direction!"
4,"Very spacious and clean. They have two train that ride around the park. I think I like riding on it even more than my daughter! They also have a carousel, two playgrounds and two snack shops. I rate this the number 1 park in Phoenix!"
4,Took my nieces here a few weeks ago. Great place for kids of all ages. Very inexpensive too so that was a bonus.
2,"This is for the Sunday night concert series. If you like families and dogs and strollers and people running around your blanket and trains blaring their horns and lousy sound systems and parking from hell, the Sunday night concert series should be on your radar. My chunky date and myself found a decent location away from the stage, but still experienced most everything previously mentioned. None of it really bothered us too much, so if you can endure all of that or actually somebody with multiple dogs and kids, then this is your piece of cake. The Scottsdale douchebag factor was not in effect, but you will have to arrive early to get a spot across the street. Now, it might have been more crowded due to holiday weekend, but who knows unless I go again which I doubt."
2,"This is about the fourth visit to Goldmans and although a lot of people rave about it, I don't think it's as good as Chompies.\nI had the pastrami sandwich on this visit, and although it was good, it simply doesn't have the flavor that Chompies has. \nThat being said, it's still a good choice for a big deli sandwich, and a good value when considering the size of the sandwiches.\nTheir breads are very fresh, and portions huge, but still, not as tasty as Chompies...."
1,"I like small businesses. \nI like low prices. \nThis place is both - and I still don't like it. \n\nThey carry cheesy, plastic jewelry which has come in handy a few times for theater but other than that most of the jewelry is to be desired. \n\nIt's usually pretty dim in there, and the owner always smells strongly of stale smoke. \nShe posts photos of shoplifters she caught on the wall - whereas I understand what she's trying to do - it makes me feel weird. \n\nAnd to be honest, the owner is... well she's rude. She seems to think she's doing all of us a favor by BEING there - which I suppose is true. Her prices are ROCK BOTTOM for cheap watch batteries, and simple jewelry repair. But at this point in my life, I'd prefer to pay a little more for better (less pungent) service."
1,"As far as a company, Famous Footwear treats me really well.  But this review is specifically for this location. \n\nThe selection available at this store is just terrible.  This might as well be an outlet store. \n\nAfter stopping in several times over the past 10 years, I've never even seen a shoe, sandal or boot I actually wanted to even try on.  \n\nI order most of my shoes online through Famous, but the location at Tempe Marketplace usually has a decent selection.  Head and shoulders above the selection here."
0,"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!\n\nFrom the moment I spoke about getting a car wash to the moment I left, I regretted being there. Terrible customer service, I don't mind emotionless service but don't be rude to me, I don't need your service, plenty of other car washes I can take it to. Which I will be because I will never return nor recommend. Whole demeanor changes once they realize you don't want their 'detail' or 'windshield replacement', even the cashier is downright terrible. Luckily, I had a bunch of free coupons for the wash they've been putting in parking lots, cause the quality is about the same as a $5 automated car wash and not worth the hassle.\n\nNEVER AGAIN!"
4,"went for restaruant week.\nabsolutely fantastic.\nthe filet mijon was so moist and rich, not overly seasoned.\nthe creme brulee was the perfect way to end my meal. \nthe staff are very professional and friendly. \natmosphere compliements the entire experience.\ni hear they have an amazing happy hour!!!"
3,Went because of their $50 gift coupon.  The two for $99 filet and lobster tail special with sides and dessert was perfect.  Not Caesar salad fans but this one was tasty and the fresh bread was a nice start.  Fresh margaritas were made just right.  Leftover dessert came home with us.\nWill definitely return for their attention to detail.
4,"Now I know what everyone thinks, \""This is a chair restaurant, why are you bothering with a review?\"" \nWell, two reasons, one they have amazing service and two - I ate the MOST outstanding burger since I moved to AZ.  I arrived at 6:30 - waiting patiently for my 2 friends who were leaving the country for good, a little goodbye party.  \nMy waitress was the sweetest person I had met and she really cared about her job and the tables she was dealing with.  I couldn't help but love her.  I ordered food and drink off the Happy Hour Menu - and let me stop here to explain this amazing situation: $5 food, martinis and wine - ARE YOU SERIOUS?  (as a heart attack)\nAnyway I was still waiting on my very late friends and wanted to stick in their 2 drinks before happy hour ended - and the lovely waitress ordered them, but waited to bring them, because she doesn't want them to have warm drinks - Can you believe this amazing service? \nLets move into the Burger, with peppered bacon and cheddar cheese.  Huge onion ring, and a little wedge for my burger.  I have no clue what sauce was served, but it was outstanding too.  I scarfed half the burger and could barely save the second half for my BFF (who still wasn't there).  The BBQ Shrimp, Calamari and Ahi Tuna all were amazing and I cannot rave enough. \n\nI really appreciate staff and the restaurants they work at that go that extra mile.  They easily could have made me pay full price for the additional 2 beverages, but they didn't and its those little gifts that earn a review like this and a pat on the back!!"
4,Amazing happy hour! Spendy but not at happy hour.
3,"I stumbled across this place while looking for lunch. Great hole in the wall, everything looked delicious. I had the gyro, not too shabby."
0,"After reading some of the reviews I thought this pizza joint would be a good choice, but was totally wrong. I ordered a 14\"" pizza with fresh tomatoes and a Greek salad. The pizza was extremely bland, absolutely no flavor!!! The salad was also bland and soggy so, I couldn't enjoy that either. Waste of twenty bucks!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone or ever come back."
2,"OK,\n\nPizza delivered to my hotel.  Check.\nOpened up the box and the pie looked delicious. Check.\nPizza had ingredients as requested. Check.\nPizza cut in squares, like a true Chicago pie. Check\nPizza cut all the way through the dough. EPIC FAIL.\n\nMy oh my.  When you pick up a slice (Chizona's cuts the pie is squares) you want to pick up a slice with all of the ingredients on top of the slice.  Three of us (two who never had a Chicago style thin crust) and not one slice was cut all the way through.  In a hotel room, with no cutlery we tried our best to keep the ingredients on top of each slice, but pulling apart slices, that are not cut, created an awful mess.  We ended up with a bunch of hand pulled empty slices, and trying our best to put the ingredients on each slice.  We gave up.\n\nIf you cant cut a pie, which is so Pizza 101, than you create a crappy experience for your customer.  \n\n3 stars for the fresh ingredients, great sauce, the owner adding some Giardiniera (very fresh and tasty). Minus 2 stars for the mess that was created by the pizza not being cut all the way through.\n\nI had so much higher hope's.\n\nStay hungry my friends..."
3,"A little hole-in-the-wall kind of gem that has delicious eats. I was in the mood for some serious grub that wouldn't break my bank, and thanks to Yelp, I stumbled upon this place with 4-stars and one dollar sign. Perfect. It lived up to my expectations! \n\nI ordered the ChiZona hot dog and homemade french fries. This is the kind of hot dog that you need to order as is, Chicago style, with all the yummy fixings to make it great. The french fries are really good, crispy, crunchy, and they give you a large portion. \n\nMy boyfriend got the Italian beef sandwich and he was very happy with his order. It was a giant sandwich so he ended up taking half of it home. Luckily, he is moving closer to ChiZona so I have a feeling we will be eating there quite often. We both left full and happy for less than $20 altogether! \n\nExcited to try their pizza and chicken tenders!"
0,"Terrible customer service and website cost me $100 as their website let me place an order online, while I had an installer working on the project. I got an email saying it was ready for pick up and was 10 miles away from home before they called me to say they did NOT have any of what I needed. I had checked twice in the two days before today to make sure they had stock at other stores as my local store was out. \n\nSo since I was driving I asked them to check stock at other stores (as I had already checked the one 3 miles from my house). She told me there is NONE anywhere in the state as it is special order. \nSo I sent the installer home, and now it is going to cost me another trip charge to come back to finish the job.\n\nSo then I call their Corporate 'Customer Care' line who finds stock 25 miles from my house and tells me they can give me 10% off for my trouble. I already had 10% off on line from coupons so this was insulting. Then they promised to call me back, and never did.\n\nBetween their website that will tell you one store is out of stock and another has stock even though they have NONE, and a Customer Service person giving out mis information, I will have to spend my time and gas to go get the products, and pay an additional trip charge to my installer. At least if the Customer service person took the time to check, I could have driven and gotten the product and gotten my project done today, with 'just' my time and gas being wasted."
1,I don't think I saw an employee for the first 10 minutes I was in there. Once I basically ran into one he was helpful.
1,"I ordered custom counter tops and had them installed by Lowe's in my laundry room. The color was what I had been looking for in a quartz. The installers somehow scratched (must had been with a saw) the top of the counter top. I complained and they came out and \""fixed\"" it by polishing a small section. Now I have a shiny spot in the middle of the counter top.\nI am so disappointed. I spent $2000 for this and see the shiny spot every time I walk through the room. They are functional, but this is so disappointing. Don't have any custom work done."
3,"Best place to get a watch battery changed, have your jewelry repaired or buy second hand beautiful and unique jewelry. Don't be fooled by the other jewelers who want to charge you more money if you own a Movado or other high end watch, the competitor's  18-25 dollar batteries don't last any longer  and DO NOT affect the timing! Many Rolex owners discovered this gem of a place. They also have the add a pearl necklaces with the pearls sold separately.\nNancy is a struggling business woman who has a kind heart! Don't be dismayed by the lack of fancy furniture in the shop, the work is quality."
2,"Very similar to Filibertos in price and quality. Good with mass quantity. The place is small, and pretty simple."
1,"I am sttill struggling to find sushi that compares with Zushi Puzzle or Sushi Bistro in San Francisco or with my all time favorite, Sansei in Maui.  I was optimistic about this place based on reviews, but it really is just average.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty good, nice and clean, makes an effort at seeming Japanese.  Portions were very large and we did over order.  Nigiri was fresh.  The waitress either got our order wrong or the shrimp tempura roll looked and tasted like eel and the spicy tuna roll was not spicy.  When asked, she insisted that the plan tuna roll was actually a spicy tuna roll.  It didn't make sense because spicy tuna was delivered as part of the hand roll special and that was actually quite good?   The Eel tempura roll was quite tasty.\n\nI hate fake crab...its bad enough in a California roll, but horrible in a hand roll special, I mean why bother?  All the special rolls are just variations on California Rolls (again, with the fake crab).  I like a combination of nigiri and rolls, but there's just not a lot of imagination here.\n\nIced green tea was very yummy.\n\nMay or may not go back...still searching...."
3,"I always pause before giving good reviews to restaurants I love because I want to keep them a secret.  But I'll be generous and share.  \n\nIf you're looking for outstanding sushi, great portions, fun employees and a reasonably priced restaurant, Sakana is it. They have a sushi happy hour, and they have customer appreciation every Thursday.  Their sushi portions are almost excessive and I've never, ever had a bad meal there.  Denise goes out of her way to say hello to everyone,and the sushi chefs will call out their welcome as you walk through the door.\n\nIf you're looking for the typical shiney Scottsdale atmosphere, you've come to the wrong place.  Nor can you sit at the bar and sip cocktails, because there is no bar (except the sushi bar).  But if you want awesome sushi and great service, you must check this place out."
3,"Great neighborhood sushi restaurant.  Happy hour is super cheap.  Buy a beer and get a 50cent app?  Sign me up!  My friend and I ordered around 10 rolls and orders of sushi plus a couple beers and our bill was only $50.  Sushi was fresh and good quality.  All the rolls we ordered were delicious.  4 stars only because the service was a little slow, but they only had 2 guys rolling sushi for the entire restaurant."
1,"You will find here:\n\n1) mediocre frostbitten sashimi\n\n2) scallops that will get you sick\n\n3) a den of witches. \n\nThe first two are self explanatory. The third will be explained in detail.\nThe food here is okay run-of-the-mill americanized sushi. Three star fare. The ambiance is good so that miiiight bump things up to a 3.5 star.\n\nHOWEVER the unique service forces me to ding my rating down to a two.\n\nThe waitresses here are chinese. I am chinese. I also understand chinese. So when the waitresses conspire to secretly sell my coworkers and i their crappier alcohol, i understand what is going on.\n\nCome on.....  \n\nHiro is where it's at."
4,"I went here today for lunch   Needing time away  from work so I drove to sakana I walked in, the place was very busy right off the bat I was greeted with a big hello and smile ......thank you I had the savanna lunch special 9.99 which included miso soup a nice salad  6 or so pieces of fish 6 pieces of rolls and a smoked salmon tempura roll  thing very good and plenty of food"
4,"FOR LUNCH ONLY!!!!\n\nCame here the other day for lunch because I had heard about the lunch special. It was a little confusing at first because the specials are written on a dry erase board and are not on the menu. But for $10 you get miso soup, a side salad and a huge variety plate of sushi. This is an unreal deal. I'd literally come here EVERY day for lunch if I could."
4,"eaten here for 10 years, best sushi ever, fair prices and very nice people"
0,"I am a little confused as to how this place got so many good reviews. Perhaps I went at the wrong time.\n\nI went to Sakana for dinner and not only was the service pretty bad, the food was disappointing as well. Our hostess was impatient and forgetful. Everything at Sakana is just a variety of a the California roll and they are super generous, not in a good way, with the imitation crab. If you aren't too picky about sushi and are itching for some rice and imitation crab, this place is definitely the place to go."
1,"This course is fine to play, however we have experienced two issues that need mentioning.  \n\nFirst, one of our foursome recently had his first ever hole in one here at Silverado.  After the round, we mentioned the feat in the pro shop - and you could have heard a pin drop.  No fanfare whatsoever.  Other courses generally offer to take the information down for publicity purposes - or at least offer hearty congrats - but not here.  \n\nSecond, I recently attempted to make a reservation using a 2-rounds-of-golf certificate I had won at a local golf tournament.  The head pro answered my call to the course, and advised me that the course was closed for two weeks for overseeding.  My certificate expired in one week, so I asked if he could honor it right after the course reopened.  You guessed the answer .  .  . . . . .\""No.\""\n\nSo it will be a long thime before my shadow again graces this particular course."
1,"This review started as one about Chompie's at the PV Mall. We will never again go to this Chompie's.  See below:\n\n\""We have been going to the Chompie's on Shea for over two years and really enjoyed the Hometown NY food and atmosphere. It reminded us of all the good things that you would find at Katz's in lower Manhattan. \n\n\""Okay, so why the setup for another Chompie's location?  Well the last few times at the Shea location we sat and waited, and waited(15 mins or so) for our waiter to come by and ask us for our drink order. Hey, when you're busy that's to be understood -- but our waiter was on break most of time and the place was half empty.  Also, it seems whenever we asked for anything (pickles, napkins, etc) our waiter seemed fairly indifferent to us.  It happened a few more times on different visits and so we had enough. \n\n\""Well, our trek in the desert has been rewarded. This Chompie's (PV Mall) is everything the other one wasn't.  The wait staff came by immediately and ask about our drinks order & offered suggestions on different menu items. We were thrilled. We didn't realize there was another Chompie's nearby.  And the food was great (just like the one on Shea)!\n\n\""From now on we will shlep the extra 10 minutes to the PV Mall location and will try to forget all about the other one over on Shea.  If you're into Katz's and some Catskill theater then you might enjoy the Chompie's on Shea, we didn't!\""  When the wait staff stand around talking while you're hungry, it's a real mood kill.\n\nSo go to Chompie's at the PV Mall and enjoy the food and service and feel free tip generously.  Oh, BTW there's a ton of parking available at PV another difference in their favor.  Enjoy!"
3,"This is a fabulous place to go when you have been induced with medical supplements while undergoing tests! After spending the majority of the day at Mayo Clinic, my girlfriends and I ventured here for some well-needed nourishment. The fasting thing does not work well for me! In my drug induced state, I ate all 6 pickles, yep ate them all and boy were they tasty as ever. And then I ordered a liverwurst sandwich with onions and cheese on rye bread! Really? Yes, really. And it was superb! Let's just say the entire experience is but a blurrrrrrr, but the service was good, fast, and the food amazing. Then I needed some dessert! The fridge is full of lots of goodies. Now that I am coherent again, I just shake my head and help myself to some rugallah every time I pass through the kitchen. OH WELL, I deserve a little reward for all I have been through today! :)"
4,"I go out a lot... my fridge consists of Lea & Perrin Worcester Sauce and bottled water... so when I say this place had one of the BEST breakfast places... it is my favorite meal of the day and I think I've tried EVERY breakfast joint in AZ.\nI think I have tried everything on the menu, but I have to say if I had to pick just one... it would be the corned beef hash.  The lunch and dinner menu has so many choices that I've been here at least a 100 times and I don't think I've ordered the same thing twice. Everything is a standout, but if I had to say what menu item would a new customer not leave without trying... is the Matzo Ball soup!! Absolutely the best I've had (sorry grandmother!).\nI've been to the other 3 locations and they are all great with wonderful service and quality food. The Scottsdale location decor is probably a little drab while the other locations are more updated, but the location is superb and easy to find."
3,"Although I think on some level the atmosphere (how many Jewish delis are there in the Phoenix area?) and mammoth proportions somewhat overshadow how good the food at Chompie's actually is, at the end of the day this is a solid restaurant with good food.\n\nI have only been to this location one or two other times prior to this last visit (and it/they were both a LONG time ago), but I have been to the Tempe one from time to time when I'm in town for a visit & despite the different layouts (for some reason this one \""feels\"" more like a Jewish deli), the food & service at both locations are similar.\n\nI don't like pickles at all, but it's nice that they put them out at your table like some restaurants do w/bread, chips/salsa, etc...\n\nThe menu here is HUGE and breakfast is served all day, which I like. Last time I was here I had a chorizo & cheese omelet, and it came w/home fries (I think I could have substituted them for fruit or cottage cheese, but I was on vacation) and a bialy (can substitute w/bagel, English muffin, or toast). This was a TON of food. The omelet & homes fries were a bit greasy, but hey, they were good. I do LOVE that Chompie's serves bialies! \n\nThe service here can be a bit slow, but nothing TOO much worth complaining about. At the end of the day Chompie's is a solid spot."
3,Update:  The Chompies in Scottsdale sent us a gift card to apologize for our experience.  That was not necessary although we did accept and we used it last night.  We did go to the location near Chandler mall and had a wonderful meal and experience.  The hostess and wait staff were pleasant and the food was very delicious.
3,Place has great food! Service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the wait.\n\nHighly recommended place for breakfast!
0,"Coming from Michigan which has one or two outstanding Deli's, Chompie's was a huge disappointment.  Their corned beef was lousy compared to Vienna brand.  Their prices are beyond ridiculous.  I will continue my search for a good Jewish Deli in Arizona."
4,I am from New York was looking for a good ny style deli found Chompie's figured I'll give it a try they have great matzah ball soup seen man vs food slider challange had to try it they have awesome Jewish sliders with lots of gravy yummmy will be back again
3,Love this place! They have the best Reuben sandwich around town. I always get mine on sourdough and a side of extra thousand Island. At $15 it is well worth the price and a great treat.  Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben.
3,"I really like the food here - it's well prepared with quality ingredients. Not much on atmosphere (unless you like dining on picnic benches under the glow of florescent lighting), so it's best to call ahead and take it home with you."
0,This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out. BIG mistake. I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had. The noodles weren't fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long. Extremely mushy and not edible. The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup. I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong. The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly. Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu.
4,"Hands down the best restaurant around. If I were to take one place to a desert island, it would be Houstons. BridgetZ gives me a hard time because it's a chain, but she was also spoiled by living in Manhattan for a while. I still bet she'd put it in her top 5. Things I love:\nHamburger (best in town)\nSpinach Artichoke Dip \nRibs (best I have ever had)\nAhi Tuna Salad (if you are needing to keep it light)\nChicken tenders"
4,"My place for a steak anywhere and always.\n\nTheir service is consistently good and their food quality is top notch.  \n\nIn 20 plus years of dining with them I've only had 2 mediocre steaks and both times the staff exceeded our expectations in correcting the matter.  Wine selection used to be better with more Spanish and Argentine options.  Get rid of the Malbec che.  Es puro pedo.  Dame Rioja, Bonarda o Cabernet."
4,Always satisfying and never a let down!\nEverything we ordered was cooked to perfection.\nEach steak was juicy and the seared tuna was excellent!\nThe atmosphere here is comfortable with traditional flare.\nA really nice place to spend any meal!
1,"Houston's is good but definitely not the caliber that they used to be.  The service was sub-par, the food was good this time but has been hit and miss the past couple of times.  They are missing the consistency that you used to be able to rely on.  Also, when we ordered a birthday brownie, they didn't bring a candle and they billed us for it - SERIOUSLY?! (the waitress knew as she said \""oops, I forgot the candle\"")  Between that and charging $3 PER soda, it just seems like they are nickle and diming their customers to death.  J Alexanders has the same food with the same hit and miss service so, why pay more at Houston's.  \n\nThe food we had this time was their spinach/artichoke dip with chips and we each got their chicken salad which seemed to have more peanuty spice to it which we enjoyed.  Their brownie dessert is to die for....probably literally with all that sugar but oh so good.  The total for the food and 2 sodas and tip was $70 (no alcohol!).  You can go to a lot better places for $70 or spend half as much for the same food across the street at J Alexanders.  Houston's no longer offers anything that distinguishes themselves or makes them worth it."
0,"I discovered Houston'swhile in Atlanta on business in the 90's, and have been a great fan.  After I moved to Scottsdale in 1999, I became a serious regular and found Houston's to be a 5 star experience every time.  It was a great relationship until the changes started a few years ago.  First, their wonderful Filet disapppared for awhile, unimpressive sushi was introduced, then the Shashimi Tuna Salad disappeared, and the Phoenix location was rebranded as Hillstone.  (I ate at Hillstone twice and then gave up on it...corn on the caeser salad - a southwestern Shashimi Tuna Salad - really?)  But back to Scottsdale, where I have the most history and the strongest relationship.  They had wonderful staff who, even if I wasn't around for awhile, remembered my name and nearly all of my preferences.  Every one of them have recently left.  Service now is ok, but not great.  A high level of attentiveness is a thing of the past.   Of course, over the years the prices have increased but in the last few they have really been increasing, while portion sizes on items like salads, have dwindled.  Houston's has never been inexpensive, but I am happy to pay to have the food that I want.  Therein lies the rub.  My last two visits were so bad that I am determined not to go back.  \n\nMy very favorite - the shashimi tuna salad - is history again.  Although the offered, if I wanted to pay the price of the $24 Flying Tuna Platter, to fix me something sort of like it, but not with the dressing or other elements that I loved.  I ordered fries, but they have lost their snap, and I had to pick little bits of fiber off of them.  The manager explained that they were burlap fibers from the bags that they use.  I didn't eat them, and was not charged for them.  I eat early, but can no longer get a baked potato at 2pm - and where did the pork chop go?  No more 1/2 glasses of wine.  So on my very last trip, not finding anything that we came for on the menu after 13 years of dining, my friend and I decided to go with the tortilla soup rather than just leaving.  It was far too salty...not something I have ever experienced at Houston's.  Of course, they did not charge us for the \""meal\"".  No reason to ever go back now.\n\nLeaving Houston's with an empty stomach, I considered stopping at Bandera, another Hillstone property.  I quickly wrote off that idea since they've tinkered with their menu items so much that I gave up my \""regular\"" status there in 2010.  \n\nI believe that the Hillstone Restaurant Group has made some awful choices over the past few years, making changes to long time favorites that ruin the dining experience.  Perhaps new chefs can't just leave a good thing alone or need to put their stamp on it.  I saw this in another review and couldn't stat it better - \""I understand menu changes happen but it was so good and so the same for so many years why do they have to switch it all up now? Pretty sure the business model was working just fine. \""  \n\nAs steep as Houston's prices have been over the years, I didn't mind paying for great food and great service.  I'll probably go in for a fillet a couple of times a year, but I'll have to wait until it's crowded at 5pm to have a baked potato with it."
3,"My first review :) A friend took my sister and I here for our birthday. Staff was really nice and our server was great. We asked her for some recommendations. I ordered the Hawaiian ribeye and omg!!!! It was definitely the best steak I have had so far! It was mouthwatering and the flavor is laced throughout the whole meat. It was a good sized piece, 12 oz probably, and it was so good that I finished it all. I can't wait to go back and have more soon! The spinach dip is yummy too! Wasn't a fan of the five but brownie though, that is why I am giving this place a 4.5 instead of a 5. Not sure how to give half stars. Either way... I'm coming back for sure :)"
0,"What a terrible experience.  I love Houston's and there are very few restaurant chains that I can say that about.  I look forward to going to a Houston's any time I can.  We went into this one on a Friday evening, February 21st of this year.  It was later in the evening but we were just going to have a drink at the bar and perhaps a snack.  We walked in and the place was jumping.  Luckily there were a few seats available at the bar where we saw one of the bartenders JUST serving entrees as we arrived.  We were met by a female bartender (blonde) who stopped us in our tracks to say \""sorry we are closing and so longer serving\"".  Again- the place was packed and people were still waiting for their dinners!  I know the difference between stopped seating vs stopped serving!  She was so fricking rude that it has stuck with me these past four months!  We explained we were just looking to have a drink and maybe a snack but couldn't even get the sentence out before she shut us down again.  Clearly she had after work plans or took a cranky pill but one this is clear- she should NOT be behind the bar at This or any other decent restaurant!  She has a very bright future down at the DMV however.  Thanks for trying to kill our evening Ms Sunshine!"
1,"The fact this restaurant has 4 stars boggles my mind. The service and atmosphere is great but the food, unfortunately was a let down. \n\nWe were recommended this place by a friend because of how much my bf loves french dips. We figured for $19 and the rave reviews it would be a great sandwich. If you love bread, not a lot of meat and sub par au jus, then this would be the sandwich for you. I've had plenty of better french dips at local bars, for half the price. We also requested extra crispy french fries, which came out pretty soggy.\n\nI ordered the thai steak salad. I LOVE thai everything, but this salad was just a smorgasbord  of clashing flavors. The filet in my salad was also very salty. Not a very well thought out dish, was only able to eat half of it. \n\nAll in all, not worth the price. Disappointing.  Won't be back."
4,"Houstons is my favorite spot for lunch. Great wine list when it's not a business lunch. Sounds silly but get the chicken tenders, they will not disappoint. A child's dish done in an adult manner. The service is always great."
2,"I prefer \""All About Tennis\"" but SA gets a thumbs up for having a decent selection of Tennis-related gear, having wide-size tennis shoes in stock, XL size socks (these are shockingly hard to find), plus it's really close to home and the club."

0,"Bad environment, worse food. Geriatric smokers coughing everywhere! How does this place continue to operate in Scottsdale?  Simply awful. Canned, mushy vegetables. Not a fresh ingredient to be found anywhere. The even have signage touting themselves for their ice cream. Don't get too excited, it's just Dreyer's. Avoid Randy's at all costs, considering the other options nearby. Disgusting."
0,I'm new to town so thought I 'd check out this place since it was close to my new home. I'm looking to find a regular salon to go to and this is definitely not the one. I got a gel manicure and the whole time she was hurting me like no other! She was VERY rude to me throughout the whole visit and didn't even give me a massage with my $25 manicure. \n\nThe place itself is very dirty. It seems like they haven't cleaned for about 6 months. They blatantly point at you when they are talking about you in another language. \n\nI would never go back! I wouldn't mind paying a little more so I don't have to put up with my nail lady disrespecting and hurting my skin like that.

4,"We had a terrific experience here with Dr. Soltero. \n\nWe were a bit nervous about taking our great big 12 year old Belgian Malinois to a vet's office - her entire life, she was seen by a recently-retired vet that made house calls. We looked on Yelp and saw that Saguaro was in our city and had great reviews, so we made an appointment since our dog's back legs seemed to be giving her trouble. \n\nThe place is very clean and most of the staff were friendly. We did not have to wait long to see Dr. Soltero, who was kind and soft spoken. His assistant was also great with our dog and friendly with us. He gave our dog a thorough exam and helped us to consider several possible causes of her leg pain and prospective treatments. He knew what each course of action would cost, and helps us to weigh our options. In the end we chose the conservative option of treating her first with an anti-inflammatory, and we saw some improvement almost right away. \n\nShe's since been back for a follow up appointment, which was also a quick one, and Dr. Soltero called himself and left us a message about the blood work results. \n\nOverall we were extremely pleased with our experience and will return when our pets need care."
0,I talked to the owner to request a 1 hour donation to deliver a cake for a 4 year old little girl in hospice. The owner was extremely rude and claimed that he gave to charity often and doubted the validity of my story. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
0,"You know how you hear about shady operations? THIS is one of them. The \""Relief Manager\"" is a shady character (Lisa?) and Katherine the flunky who works as ? god knows what is a joke as well. I am warning you, this place is so far from legal you need to beware. When I first came to this joke of a place they told me they took credit cards, then come to find out my first month rent came about and they didnt take credit cards.This is how it has been, from the beginning. LIES LIES AND SHADINESS! I have finally got out of there and now they are stalking me when I hand dropped off the appropriate paper work when I was moving and after a couple months they contacted me saying they never got the paper work. I HAND DELIVERED this paper work... I then sent in the appropriate name changes to have the unit in my exes name. They say they never got that months later... haha! They call me all the time when I have asked them not to, which is against the law, please learn the law morons, since you are the business and breaking them. Please BEWARE consumers. I have never dealt with such an illegal, backdoor, shady operation in my life. It is crazy this place can stay in business.I guess its all about turnover! \n When I ask who the owner is to try and resolve this the right way, so I know it gets done, Lisa( so she says her name is), said I cant give out that info.... YOU CANT GIVE THE OWNERS NAME OUT? HA!!!!!!Really??? What a joke... BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!  \nI will be contacting the BBB as well as the City Township to let them know all of the shady things involved in this place. I have proof of some. I will start with this, then I will move forward from there."
0,"I'm trying really hard not to be harsh. Honest. But this place has so many negatives and so few positives.\nMany of the reviews here mention the noise. They just don't give enough bad credit to the soundproofing.  This place is horrid for sleeping.  I stayed here Memorial weekend. The room was clean but certainly not elaborately decorated. Needed more towels. Bathroom so-so. Nothing about the room or property decor stated \""upscale\"" or \""resort\"".\nPool needs more lounge chairs, they were all hoarded and taken very early in the day. Misters would be a small but welcome addition to the Oasis bar by the pool. The Oasis bar was frequently understaffed. The poor person stuck there, \""Jaimie\"" was very pleasant but overwhelmed by the work load.  The concierge in the lobby was flat rude to several folks on situations I eavesdropped on. Front desk on check in was nothing special.\nBack to the noise....Walking down the hallway rooms 160's, 170's, etc., my friends and i could and did stop and listen to any number of conversations thru the closed doors. Mind you this was standing in mid-hall, not up against door. Amazed at how poor the soundproofing. At night the place was a crashbox of noise. Simply unacceptable on any level. And certainly poor for a Resort/Spa property.\nMy comments to the front desk regarding noise were treated as, \"" Ho-Hum. Heard it all before. \""\nWhen asked about Phoenix by coworkers and friends I'll have too, in good manners, steer them far away from this facility. Which is a shame. There is no way I can recommend this place at all. Too many fine properties, good pools, and nice staff at facilities in Phoenix area. \nThis is definitely not one of them."
3,"I just had to drop a note to say just how nice it was to have fast, clear and strong Wi-Fi in my room.\nWhomever handles that for your place is doing great work."
1,"I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before booking. The bathroom is really small, which wouldn't be a problem if the door opened towards the outside... The power plugs were loose in the bathroom and non-existent throughout the rest of the room.\n\nWe were there for two nights, and was never serviced. We traveled with our two dogs so i made sure to call the front desk to let them know when we would be out with the dogs so they could come and clean the room... I did that twice the same day, and was clearly unsuccessful.\n\nI sent clothes to dry cleaning, and they were supposed to be ready by 9am the next morning... 11am nothing and we were already 2 hours behind schedule to hit the road. It took another 45 mins to get them and check-out. When I called to inquire about it, the lady at the front desk was as unpleasant as one can be. \n\nI won't go back to this hotel."
1,"Fianc\u00e9 added my name to the room online (using the hilton website) since he would be coming in later that night. I had a copy of the email confirmation from hilton but the ladies in the front desk wouldn't let me check in without him calling. I just showed you the confirmation email with my name... Could show you my ID to verify. Didn't care, said online requests don't count... Seriously. I would have had to wait the entire day in the lobby if my friends weren't there because he was taking finals and couldn't be disturbed. During the nights, you hearing creaking noises from the ceiling and walls and the tv at the outside bar had poor reception throughout my stay- mentioned to them but they said they couldn't do anything about it. Good location though, close to a lot of great restaurants and shopping."
0,"THEY MADE QUACKING-TALK TO MUCH HAND GESTURES TO MY FACE!\n   \nI took my cashmere wool blend coat to Celebrity Drycleaners.  Because of the cashmere blend, I specifically asked for a quote on the item.  The quote was reasonable, upon my return to pick up the coat I was charged double what I was quoted.    I was told there was no way they quoted me that price and they called me a liar.\n  \nIt was so rude, the other customers in the store started to argue for me (thank goodness for good people sticking up for each other).\n  \nWhen I continued to try and get the quoted price, the counter person made the gesture with her hands, like a duck quacking (the gesture you make when someone is talking too much).   Wow!  I called her out on that!   It was so rude.  \n\nWhen I asked to talk to the owner, the lady suddenly didn't understand english.  Then, after finally understanding the word \""owner\"" said she was the owner.  What a joke!\n  \nI filed a compliant with the Better Business Bureau. Celebrity Cleaners refused to respond to BBB letters.  I've used this service for my husbands business shirts and pressing services on and off for more than 10 years.  I'd be crazy to give them any more business."
2,"Dam you Doug !!!\n\nOk, I thought I be the first but Doug beat me to it. \n\n Any establishment that has a free happy hour for it's guest is a plus nuff said. Yes -the 4th floor grill is awesome and the bar staff will give you the In's & outs of Scottsdal-ing culture and the pizza they serve is pretty dam good- the complimentary breakfast was was actually good too.\n\n I'm not sure if they still do the free happy hour thing but what sold me on this lets say resort - is that while I was there , there was a whole bus full of girls that where promoting - some kinda of alcoholic beverage - and I heard from a good source many beverage companies uses the Chaparral as a pit stop for their promotional tours... \n\nWord- I guess they come for the pool's..."
2,"We choose this hotel based on the yelp reviews. The room was clean and welcoming. Comfy beds and and I liked the little balcony. However the free wi fi never worked. We didn't take advantage of the free snacks as this was to inconvenient to go down to the lobby every time we wanted something. It was loud at night with thin walls but it was understandable as there was a wedding going on.  The breakfast in the morning was nice quaint and busy. I didn't see much of the staff, so can't make a comment there. I don't know that I would stay again but it was a nice little get away."
1,"My wife and I stayed here for a few days while in town on business.We had a suite overlooking the central courtyard at the back.Turns out that's where the delivery trucks do their deliveries and for 3 days in a row at some unGodly hour 2 tour buses were loading up Japanese tourists.My God what a racket !There is nothing in the suites as far as utensils....not a spoon,not even a bloody bottle opener.And then there was the clincher...must be why the place was pretty full.From 5.30pm to 7.30pm every day its happy hour in the large breakfast room with free cocktails and light beer.Every man and his dog was there...mostly quite elderly people getting medicated for the evening.It was pretty funny really.My wife and I were down there shooting some pool and the place was packed with oldies walking around with little plastic cups of cocktails or light beer.It's like a nursing home on steroids."
3,"I think I might have spent a little too long deciding what to include in this post, but as someone who has spent a long time renting and had some pretty miserable experiences, I try to include everything I wish I would have known. Apartment reviews can be TERRIFYING, there are some angry renters out there. Here's what I took from my lovely 10 month stay at Miramonte. \n1. This apartment doesn't look like much from the outside, and its nothing fancy for sure, but in my experience the office staff is extremely helpful, the maintenance man is reliable and friendly (eventually I even had no problem giving him permission to enter while I wasn't there) and its very reasonably priced. The interiors are updated with nicer carpet, newer kitchens and they have washer and dryers! big plus for me.\n\n2. The pool is awesome, when it works. They have been having some issues but I do believe its fixed now. The gym is tiny but usually empty. \n\n3. its pretty quiet, most of the time. I lived upstairs and was never bothered by my neighbors noise. But I do believe my downstairs neighbor was slightly annoyed by me (and I am not loud and hardly home.) So Point A--live upstairs. I've found that to be true in EVERY apt complex ive ever lived in. Point B--PLEASE NOTE--THIS IS IMPORTANT--there is an elementary school on the east side of the apartment complex. I lived directly up from the parking lot, facing the school playground, and you could absolutely hear little kids playing in the morning.  It didn't ever bother me because I work all week, I only discovered this when I happened to be home sick one Wednesday. If you work a Monday-Fri 9-5 you really wont notice so I would not let that deter you from moving in. However if you sleep in late during the week, choose your location carefully, don't get a unit that faces the school.\n\n 4. The office staff will really try to be accommodating. A new office manager took over a couple months after I moved in and you can really tell she wants people to be happy about the complex. I lived here while in the process of buying a house and definitely did my share of calling the office staff with questions about extending my lease, ending my lease, month to month options, etc. When my house closed 2 months before my lease ended, of course I couldn't get out of my legally binding contract (no surprise to me there) but I was surprised that they were very helpful about my options to sublease it myself or find someone to take over my lease completely. They definitely did as much as they could. \n\n5. Parking for visitors isnt the worst I've seen but it can be difficult. There are always tons of spots open on the south end of the complex, but in the evenings most of the other public ones are taken. \n\n6. Bugs- always a big concern of mine and I would have no shame in admitting if I found them. (see my other apt review, ha!). Honestly, I found one big cockroach about a month after I moved in, called the office, they had the sprayer come and I never saw another one again. (I lived there for 10 months)\n\n7. charges. They WILL charge you for damages done to your walls or carpets, for anything that is not top-notch clean, or anything that isnt as it was when you moved in. But they aren't trying to scam you. Use your common sense on this one, you get a form to fill out when you move in that lists every detail of every room, FILL IT OUT. Keep a copy. Be present when they do the final walk through and you will be aware of any discrepancies. Just be a responsible renter and you will only pay the standard $35 carpet cleaning fee. \n\nHope that was helpful to anyone considering an apartment here. Granted all experiences and units are different, so if you move in and hate it, whoops. If you move in and like it, as I did, you're welcome."
1,"Under normal circumstances, I'm a really big fan of Ross. I love sifting through the racks and finding ridiculous bargains on great clothes. These, however, are not normal circumstances.\n\nEvery time I come to this Ross, I get the feeling that it might be on its way out.  Each visit, it looks less like they sell clothes, and more like they're selling shelf space. \n\nWhat product they DO have isn't really that well maintained, either. In a typical retail environment, the employees at least PRETEND that they have product by maintaining the shelves and facing things to fill in the dead space. Not here. \n\nTo top it all off, the areas of the store that DO have product aren't maintained at all. I get it...things get shopped. But I get the feeling that even the employees sense their impending doom, and approach their jobs as such."
0,"Never, ever, ever again. Ever. \n\nBecause even if I think your coffee blows, and even if I only gave you three stars (*gasp*), there's no excuse for talking shit about me -- loudly -- while I am forking over $10 for a sandwich. That's just a poor customer service decision, folks. As business owners, you should know that. \n\nAnd just for clarification, I never wrote that your coffee tastes like shit. But I will now: Your coffee tastes like shit. \n\nSo, no more $12 chef salads. No more $3 croissants. And definitely no more of your fake-nice bitchiness or dirty looks when I walk by in the morning with my Cartel coffee. I will save my money for an establishment that treats me like a person.\n\nPS -- look forward to a severe business decline as soon as the place across the way opens. I'll make sure to smile and wave as I walk by."
4,"I love this place! Great croissants, soup, and dessert! They are known for their delicious chocolate chip cookies!"
0,Worst Home Depot I've ever been to. Needed a sheet of plywood cut and was told by 3 different people someone would be with me. I waited for 30 minutes for something that should have taken 5 minutes at the most. The store was empty and there were employees near the front in a circle on their phones. No excuses for their inability to help.
3,If you sneak into the bakery before or after the lunch rush you can snag a cinnamon roll. These are the best cinnamon rolls I've found in Phoenix. They aren't subtle. There is often enough frosting (not the creamy kind) to put you in a sugar coma. The staff are polite and quick.\nDon't forget to tip!
4,"I was heartbroken when I pulled in and found they were closed. They were always busy. I went out of my way for their Chopped Salad. I haven't found it anywhere else and some days nothing else would do. I was hoping to find them in another location, but alas, that isn't the case.\nSerenek9@msn.com"
1,"I drop by this Chevron from time to time.  It gets very busy during the daytime.  I used to come here more frequently, but I find that sometimes they're out of premium unleaded, but I don't know until I pull up to the pump and see a little note on the pump.  That irritates me.  However, when I need gas and I'm in the area, I have no choice.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%"
4,"We bought two cameras from Lauren. She knew we didn't live there, we were on vacation. She was patient and really went long on the set up and tips. Very engaging, this is our camera place when we are in Arizona!"
4,"I must admit, based on the reviews I was a bit nervous taking my photos there to be developed, but they seem to be one of the last 3 local, pro camera places left in Phoenix that develops pictures.  Walgreens, Walmart and Target are awful for pictures (I don't have a Costco membership), and I'm one of those weird people who still likes to have an actual photo instead of an electronic image.\n\nWilson's was open on Saturday (Tempe Camera, get with the times, no weekend hours for photo developing?).  I dropped my pics off and they were ready by Tuesday.  4 x 7 glossy, just like I ordered, of my vacation pics.  The quality was superb!  Rivals Jones Photo in Tucson who I used for 30+ years until moving to Phoenix.  Wilson made good pics look even better.  Color and detail were great.\n\nService both on Sat. and Tues. was very friendly and fast.  I'm no pro and can't tell you anything about their cameras, prices, classes... just their photo developing.  I'll definitely be back again!"
4,"I drive over 20 miles one-way just for the roast beef!  You can't get quality roast beef from any store today, not even the high end grocery stores.  But you can always get it at Casella's, and at a very reasonable price.  Sure, stop by for lunch and get your hogie and meatball sandwiches, every sandwich is made with love and they are all great.  But before you leave, ask for some sliced roast beef and some provolone to go.  You will never buy roast beef from ANY grocery store again!  BTW, get some cannolis too.  They are the bomb!"
3,"Great neighborhood Deli, Bring cash, great food"
1,"There are two types of people who are patrons of this establishment: the elderly and people with free passes.  We had free passes.\n\nMy fiance's work gave him two sets of Regal movie tickets.  That would be great back in Seattle where the company is because Regal's are all over.  Here, however, there are only two theaters in the Regal family and this is one of them.  The other is on Northsight somewhere.\n\nWe saw a 645 movie and it was all old folks.  Even with them, the place was deserted!  There is one guy working concessions (with his first AND last name on his name tag - I thought that was a little weird...), one chick in the ticket booth, and that's about it.\n\nThe actual theater was even worse.  The screen wasn't all that large, the sound was awful, and it was an \""old school\"" theater.  I consider a \""new school\"" theater to be one with stadium seating.  This theater you actually walked uphill when walking towards the screen.  Sounds backwards to me!  It actually might have been worse than a regular \""old school\"" theater.  If we hadn't had free passes, we would have left.  Instead, we stayed and toughed it out.  \n\nI guess we'll venture to the Northsight location for the other two tickets.  I thought most of Scottsdale was upscale with a lot of folks around, not scarce and geriatric like Sun City.  I am no longer wondering why no one has reviewed this place - it needs to be put out to pasture!"
0,"UA Theaters have had it! Why do they keep this place open? Its run down, out of date and well, architecturally ugly! Oh yeah, this is the place that looks just like Space Mountain at Disneyland.. though the only thrill you'll get from here is when they finally bulldoze it down! \n\nThey really should put a Harkin's there where there outta be one!"
0,Every time I've been to this Denny's the service is horrible. I tried it a few times because the first time I went was later in the night so I thought if give it another shot but every time I've gone nothing has changed.
1,"We went for breakfast here while on vacation, although I didn't pick the place, I had heard good things but found it to be ok (I prefer to visit non-chains). It reminds me of any other breakfast at any other diner that isn't really memorable or great. I had the eggs benedict but whatever they called the version with avocado. It was ok, a nice change from regular eggs benedict but not as good as the menu seemed to make it out to be. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food just fine (they got salads or some skillet things). \n\nOverall the wait wasn't too bad, I didn't care for unattended children running around and the service could've been better (I waited forever before I got my coffee, and I'm not happy until I've had my coffee fix). I'd say its ok, but I don't plan on ever going back."
2,"This place is OK, not too flashy, but OK. Our family of 12 called an hour before for reservations on a busy thursday and managed to get great seating without a wait. The waitress was phenomenal, totally on top of her game and didn't batt an eyelash when she kept being sent too and froo by various sections of the table (we tipped her really well). However, the food was slightly above mediocre. My potatoes were overly cooked, and the sausage tasted wrong. My omlette was also tasting strange and was rubbery. So service was wonderful, but the food was meh."
2,"I can't stand Denny's! My youngest son had explosive dia...never mind -- bad story about a cross country trip and having to stop every 100 miles to find a Walmart and buy underwear.\n\nSo, this is a great place for breakfast, even for us late risers. Sure, a couple of the waitresses are brain damaged, but the food is good and you get a frequent diner card with every  sixth or tenth meal free. I have two full cards but haven't had a chance to see what the free breakfast includes and which waitress they give me.\n\nThe Scottsdale location has a mellow collection of conservative republicans and the \""Snottsdale crowd\"" but ignore them and park the dirtiest, most beat up car you can borrow (or have, in my case) next to a Bentley or Mercedes (make sure at least three hubcaps are removed from your vehicle). Then exit the car and walk like you're drunk. Walk behind the other persons car and look at the side. Then shrug and stumble into the restaurant. You can be sure you've perplexed and worried a diner who has watched the entire episode.\n\nFun and good food! What else is there in life?"
1,"Excruciatingly slow service, even for a Sunday morning. Good thing they didn't give me flack for bringing in my own coffee because it would have been 20 minutes before I got a cup from them. \nThe food was OK (I could be meaner about the slightly undercooked eggs) but I was more than a little miffed by conspicuous absence of steak and eggs. Isn't steak and eggs on the Mt. Rushmore of American breakfast? \nThen there was the Tomato Juice Debacle. My uncle asked for a glass of tomato juice. Waitress says, \""Is V8 OK?\"" Uncle says sure. Waitress disappears for what seems like a day and a half before returning to say, \""Um, sorry, we're out.\"" She disappears again, only to return with, \""I found some! But it's warm.\"" Uncle says no sweat, just put it in some ice. Waitress disappears again and returns with a glass of warm V8 sans ice. True story."
3,"One of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  The food is very good but the service is outstanding (especially the lady who often serves as the hostess - high energy, always smiling)"
2,I went here for breakfast daily when I was on vacation because of the reasonable prices so that I was able to do some damage at the steakhouses at night!\n\nDon't forget to get your patronage card stamped because after a certain amount I think you get a free one.\n\nThe service was good and the food was Ok but its really hard to mess up breakfast.
3,Decent breakfast and service. Cute little restaurant. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing!
0,Terrible Service. Just left after waiting 20 min to get utensils and water. Was never given a menu. Another couple was seated with menus and the server commented that we were seated first but someone else would take our order. She then turned to the couple who had just been seated and took their order.  We got up and left.  Other tables had dirty dishes on it.  The restaurant wasn't even busy and I find this unacceptable for lunch hour.
1,"This establishment is walking distance from my home, my husband and I are also very committed to supporting the local economy, and therefore we wanted to purchase our bike from a bike shop as opposed to a chain store- even though her bikes cost on average $75-100 more for the same brand (Sports Authority at TMP has the same brand of Electra bikes for less, for example).\n\nThe owner Crystal was very kind and helpful in the research process, and let us ride the different bikes out back. The beach cruisers hurt my knees and so she directed us to a \""Giant\"" brand bike where the pedals were a little farther back. I was still unsure and she recommended I try riding it longer to see. So I purchased the bike and a basket, and took it home and rode it around a little bit. The basket clinks against the bike rod (it doesn't fit correctly with the shape of the bike), and the bike still hurts my knees so we went back two days later to see about a trade-in or return, and she told us all sales were final. \n\nI expressed to her that it is bad business to have an \""all sales final\"" without putting up signage, and also without even telling the customer at the time of purchase. I find this to be manipulative and dishonest. I did notice that the receipt she gave me after purchase did say \""all sales final\"" on the top, however I did not get this until AFTER the purchase. \n\nSo now I am stuck with a bike that hurts my knees, cost $375, plus a $35 basket that does not fit. In the future unfortunately, because of this unsavory experience, I will be purchasing all future bikes from mega retailers."
1,"We used to come here when I was a kid-so recently on a visit to AZ we tried it out again. Not bad-it was weird that there was a special \""only if you pay extra\"" section of the salad bar that had the good stuff like chicken and artichoke hearts for a few extra bucks, but it ended up not mattering because we went for the 2 meals for 20 dollars route.\nIt was fine-and the Greek Lemon soup was actually good. We were there right before it closed and a person working there gave us each a bag of chocolate chip cookies for free at the end of the night. That was nice."
2,I wish I would've taken a picture of the stage! The theater is small. 2 rows of seats on either side and about 5-6 shorter rows on either end. The stage is the floor in the middle; however action can happen next to you and in front of you. \n\nIt's... intimate.\n\nWe saw Fiddler on the Roof. The signing and acting was good. The choreography was very good. I certainly feel like I got value for my ticket price.\n\nI look forward to seeing more shows here and increasing my rating with each performance!
1,"Hate is such a strong word.. I try not to use when I its not really called for. When I set out to Yelp the Safeway across the street from me and the Mr.'s place I thought of using that word to describe how much I don't like this Safeway.  Of course it's warranted, they pissed me off!\n\nOkay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the 1 gallon. Well this time she forgot to and I didn't notice until I got home.. so seeing that I used to shop here once a week I figured Id just bring my receipt back the following week. Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.'\nAfter going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.' I then told her that her customer service skills suck and that I will NEVER return to the store. \n\nI guess never say never since I went into my very much disliked Safeway the other day. Believe it or not they make a pretty damn good sandwich and I despise Subway. So the 2 stars are for the yummy sandwich and the super cute guy who made it! \n\nSo much for my convictions?!"
4,Best eyecare office in Arizona! Customer Service is best in breed and products are A rated. Highly recommended
3,They do a good job and they will come back out to retreat if you see any bugs.  From time to time I have needed them to come back because of scorpions which they gladly do.  I have used them since I moved into my house in 2001 and their prices seems fair.
3,"Some of the fellas (and one lady) from work tapped me on the shoulder and said that they were headed here for lunch.  I drove over there to meet them and to try out some pizza.  They have a great deal M-F for lunch.... 2 slices cheese and a drink for only $4.10!   Can't beat that!  The pizza was good...crisped up in the oven nice.  The cheese looked a tad greasy but it was not...no puddles to be found anywhere.  The sauce was just alright but the crust made up for it.  Really good crust! The slices were really big too!  Score!   Service was to the point, not friendly, not rude but you could tell that they were appreciative for your business.  It's only a mile or so from work so I'm sure I will be back for that killer lunch special.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food too!"
1,"I had a decent time here the other night while visiting Scottsdale... It was a Thursday, 2 for 1 drinks til midnight, but I thank my good time to the company I was in and the lovely people watching the crowd here provided. \n\nLet's start with problem numero uno- The place is located in a Safeway shopping center... no joke! So get your groceries and come shake your booty all in one trip ;) Now I know Scottsdale has a rep, and to be honest, I do enjoy surrounding myself in that scene once in a while but seriously could not get over the fact that while sitting on their \""posh\"" patio, I was watching the cart boy rounding up stray shopping carts. Location location location, this place fails miserably at that. \n\nThe drinks were okay... call me crazy but I actually prefer to taste some alcohol in my martini. \n\nAnd the decor in the place was a joke! You walk in to a big open room... think Rocky Pointe spring break style back in HS when you went to those 20$ all you can drink parties. All that was missing was the video crew recording the raunchy females, cougars in this case. The chairs/seating in the car were cheap looking and overall reminded me of Ikea.\n\nOn the plus side, it was pretty busy but chill enough were my friends and I could enjoy each others company without being knocked into by others.\n\nFor wanting a chill night with great people watching this place is great. But please get over your posh sophisticated attitude because you are far from it and the place would actually have more potential if you realized it. My favorite part of the night... A cougar with a much older sugar daddy. She walks away from daddy to be swept away my 20someyhing boy toy, only to turn around, and hang her purse on daddy before heading to the dance floor to grind on the boy. Poor daddy was left outside, purse and all, looking like a fool. Made for decent people watching. I sadly left and don't know the outcome of this.... If you were there last night and saw these scene please do tell :)"
4,"Just want to say off the bat that in no way am I affiliated with Shane Co or getting kickbacks from them. Just writing an honest review on my experience there recently.\n\n1) Overall/ Intro\n2) Sales reps\n3) Selection process\n4) Price negotiation\n5) Conclusion\n\n1) The staff was very comforting and professional. I've never been shopping for engagement rings before and the people there made it great. I knew exactly what I wanted going in, my girlfriend had sent me a bunch of creations off their website (which is an awesome resource) and I picked out the few that I liked.  It certainly helps to know the color differences (D, E, F, etc.), cuts (cushion, princess, emerald...) and clarity( VVSI, VSI, IF, etc.) before going in. That's just my personal preference. Whenever I'm buying something that's costing me twice as much as I paid for my car (which is a good ol reliable civic), I like to do my homework. But the staff is very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING jewelry. The big pluses of Shane Co for me personally include:\n-lifetime guarantee on products: pretty much fix anything you buy from them, for life. Except if it gets lost or stolen\n-60 day refund or exchange after purchase\n-6 month interest free loan to pay off whatever you buy. amount depends on cred score.\n\n2) These guys have to be trained on being low pressure. Because they let you browse around however long you want. And I must have been asked by 3 employees how I was going to propose to my gf.\n\n3) First we picked out a setting, then we went to stone. They run you through spiels about where diamonds come from, even bring out 3 mystery stone related to what you're looking for and let you guess the 4 C's. Kinda of fun. Let's you see what's important to you. After I picked out the stone, that was it. I made a down payment before leaving, got my cool IGI certificate for the diamond and then picked up the ring 2 days later.\n\n4)A big question I had before going in that I couldn't find the answer to on the internet was\""Can you negotiate prices?\"" And the answer is YES. The Shane Co rep gave this away when she asked me after I first walked in \""What out-the-door price were you looking at today?\"" After she wrote the amounts for the stone, setting, and tax on a little notepad I made an offer below the price. She walked away and got it cleared by her boss. I only bid about 5% off the price and was kind of wishing I had bid lower. But bottom line: Don't pay the tag price! \n\n5) Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and comforted by the fact that if something were to happen to the ring I can always take it into any Shane Co location and know it's getting quality repairs for FREE."
4,"Several things on sale. The sales women were helpful and talkative. The first one I talked to was anxious to help me as she apprroached me a few times. As I was leaving the store I saw a shower curtain I was interested in buying, another sales woman approached me and we had a lovely conversation regarding the curtain. She informed me that Pier 1 doesn't do all matchy matchy, they focus on incorporating colors to form a set. Pleasant experience today!"
4,"I really had a good stay at this hotel. They staff was extraordinarily friendly. They offered me water upon arrival, which was very appreciated. The room was clean and spacious. I was supposed to be there for 6 days, though l left earlier than planned. On the 3rd day, they left me some milk and cookies in my room.  Very nice! the breakfast was pretty good."
3,"I spent two nights at this particular Hampton Inn, which is located just a few blocks south of Scottsdale Rd and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. I didn't use much of the hotel amenities as all I needed was a place to sleep while plumbing repairs were being performed at my home. I found it to be very pleasant and the staff to be very friendly. The inn was very clean and looked like it was a fairly new building. As I first walked into my room, the very first thing I noticed was how wonderful the room smelled and how clean everything looked. The room I resided in had a television, microwave, small refrigerator, coffee pot with complimentary coffee along with typical condiments, a desk, and an individual HVAC unit attached to the wall. My room also included a bathroom with the usual clean towels, shampoo, conditioner, and soap. The facility also offers free Wifi with your last name and room number as your access code. My surroundings weren't loud so I slept well except for the fact that I went to bed late and had to get up for work the following morning. One other additional amenity I partook in was the complimentary breakfast; specifically, I opted for the breakfast on the go, which consisted of a brown bag with bottle of water, muffin, apple, fruit bar, and mints.\n\nThe location this Hampton Inn is situated in is pretty ideal as it is about a 7 or 8 mile drive away from the shopping, clubs, and fine dining of Downtown Scottsdale. \nThe shopping and fine dining is also just a hop, skip, and jump away within the immediate area. This is also an ideal spot for out-of-towners visiting to attend the Barrett-Jackson auction and Phoenix Open Golf Tournament that occur within the area in late January and early February. All-in-all, I highly recommend the Hampton Inn & Suites located in North Scottsdale for out-of-state visitors and anyone forced out of their home due to property damage."
4,"Love love LOVE Fox Sports Grill.  Its the perfect combination of 2 of my favorite things: beautiful people and (midwest) sports.  \n\nBelly up to the bar in the middle of the restaurant for the best people and sports watching seats in the house--there are a ton of TVs so you wont miss a minute of your favorite games, even if youre cheering for more than one team at a time.  \n\nThere are pool tables for your entertainment at half time, and a private room in the back where I once got way too saucy at a company gathering.  \n\nDJs are mixing the latest during commercials of REALLY big games, and Fox Sports broadcasts right in the bar from time to time.  \n\nPrices are Scottsdale par and the food is upscale bar.  \n\nBe sure you shower and put on your best jersey, there are some seriously good looking sports fans at Fox Sports and hell, you might even be cheering for the same team."
1,"middle of the road.  I'd give it 2.5 stars.  the shrimp fried rice was very good, the teriyaki chicken good, the orange chicken pretty blech.\n\nOverall, I'd say it was decent.  Not great, not good, but not terrible.  Just average."
3,This place is pretty damn good. The egg rolls and crab puff was amazing. I wasn't sure if this place was any good but we decided to try it out anyway and I'm glad that we did! We will definitely be ordering from here again!
4,"I've been enjoying their food since 2004 and it still until this day is my favorite Chinese food place. I'm not really big on Chinese food actually...I'm veeeery skeptical of any place new. With that being said House of Yang more than exceeds my expectations. \n\nFirst the staff is super friendly. Usually when I go in and pick up a dinner order the same guy is working the counter; I want to say he's the owner or maybe part owner? He's very friendly and engaging (ok he's kind of handsome to boot, I'm just saying) and doesn't mind when we substitute egg rolls for the soup in the dinner combos.  That's an extra plus right there. \n\nNow for the food...what can I say, nothing is bad that I've tried on this menu. The egg rolls are extra crispy, my go to is tangerine beef and man is it good. Volcano beef is also delicious, orange chicken, cashew chicken, sweet and sour pork....I can go on and on here peeps but you get the idea - it's delicious! \n\nThey do deliver; unfortunately I'm just outside their delivery range or else I'd eat there way too much. Anytime I'm craving it or I'm close we'll head there to pick up food. You'll be glad you did too! You're welcome!!"
3,"I did not play golf or eat at the restaurant - so this review is on lodging only. \n\nWe planned a surprise baby shower for several out of town guests (we were from out of town, too) and chose this location for group lodging. \n\nThe rooms are excellent for the price - the entire resort consists of 1-bedroom suites, either King or Queen plus a pull-out couch. Huge bathroom with Jacuzzi tub and separate shower, plenty of counter / mirror space, a full-size refrigerator, plus sink, dishes and utensils, and microwave. An outdoor seating area (which we didn't use, since we were here during monsoon season in Phoenix!). \n\nUnlike many other hotels & resorts, Orange Tree doesn't charge you extra for kids staying in the room, so we truly paid $60 per night for the 4 of us. Free wireless internet. \n\nWe had an issue with mosquitoes in our room -- staff promptly handled it and also took something off the bill for the inconvenience. Customer service was top-notch. \n\nBeds are all posturepedic (think \""memory foam\"") and outrageously comfortable. Plus the bedroom closes off from the rest of the suite, so it stays nice and dark in there. \n\nThe pool is very nice - lots of covered seating, and it's shady and comfortable after about 5PM. Plenty of shallow area for smaller kids to play in. \n\nMy only complaint is that unless you wind up in building #1, you cannot park anywhere near your room -- so if you forget something in the car, it's a 7-minute walk each way (from building 8, where we were) to the parking lot. From the lobby to the rooms, you can request someone pick you up in a golf cart. But I suppose the resort is designed with golfers in mind, who generally don't mind walking, even in the heat. For me, I prefer not to sweat if I don't have to, so I didn't like having so far to go each time we had to take our little ones to the car."
3,This place is the best! The grounds are very well kept and the staff has been nothing but perfect... They even helped me find a free parking space near our room. The room is very spacious and we love having a full size fridge! The tub was large and worked great. We will definitely be back!! Great location in Scottsdale. Had to remove 1 star for the tiny TVs and Xtra slow internet although everything else is great!
3,"Me and my fiancee stayed here for the weekend. We had great time staff were very respectful. The room was clean and organized. The only reason why I put 4star we had problem with parking and our room was so far from our car.\nWe are planing to comeback!\nThanks,\nJunice from Seattle"
1,"Had an appointment to get liquid gel nails done.  The lady who did my nails was very rude and I didn't like how they turned out. I tired to communicate with her but was ignored.  Will not return,  would not recommend."
3,"Highly recommend this place! Clean, friendly and pretty quick in getting you seated. Ask for Tommy, he always does a fantastic job."
0,"Be careful of this company!  I assure you the customer service you will receive in the store will be great, but that is where it will end.  If you have any warranty issues in the future they will put all the blame on you for everything!  I purchased furniture from them this summer and have had a couple of warranty issues come up.  The owner, Jim, told me that even though I bought the furniture in his store, credit card paid his company, that it wasn't their company's furniture and will not honor ANY warranty at all.  He told me that my furniture has no AZ Leather warranty, no manufacturers warranty--NOTHING.  He even went as far as telling me that I essentially have damaged goods and have to deal with it.\n\nLook at the reviews from other customers in California and you will begin to notice a pattern with these guys.\n\nBuyer beware!"
2,"Do you like being entertained by a knife-wielding Asian chef cooking at your table while you eat?  If this may sound interesting, grab a group of friends and check this place out.  Just don't expect the food to be stellar, and if you order sushi be prepared for less than average.  Benihana is a chain that specializes in a culinary circus type environment over anything else."
0,"As you can probably tell by my other reviews-- I'm one of those, \""if you don't have something nice to say....yadda yadda yadda.\""  But in the spirit of Yelp and actual critical review--- I'll have to suggest steering clear of Benihana; at least until they add more spices and seasonings to their repertoire.\n\nYes, yes, yes, I should've known.  I'm not much of a 'chain' eater-- but this was my boyfriend's family's pick for his graduation dinner.  It seems to be a family favorite.... which I can't say I really understand.  At all.  I also should mention that this review is based entirely on their only vegetarian dinner option.  \n\nI didn't get a look at the bill, but my course was at least over $25 for far less than exemplar fare. Granted, this included a miso soup, small lettuce & carrot salad, tofu appe, egg fried rice, grilled assorted vegetables as the entree, and a scoop of rainbow sorbet for dessert-- but it reaffirms how one should rely on the old standby of quality versus quantity.  And I guess they have to charge that much to keep the Benihana salt mines open....  heaven sakes! The waitress was giggling to herself about how much water I was putting down, but I really can't imagine that this is a rare thing with their preferred method of seasoning; salting the bejesus out of everything from the pasty, ginger-esque dressing on the salad and the soggy, cold, fried tofu appe to the soy-and-butter sopping vegetables.  The only reprieve was the rainbow sorbet and a nice hot green tea closer.  \n\nEveryone else at the table had either a meat or seafood course, and were quite satisfied with their meals, so MAYBE it was just the veggie option or MAYBE I'm just a picky foodie or just MAYBE this place really needs the constructive criticism.  And yes, I also realize this place is possibly more about the show than the food...???.... but our chef, though nice, was quite lackluster and didn't have a full cashe of tricks to unveil.  Just the onion volcano.  Sigh."
0,"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! At $2.50 per slice of sashimi, I expected a lot better than a recently defrosted and grainy slice of tuna. Also, do not get the Lobster Roll...it tastes like shrimp tempura that costs $27. \n\nThe service was also bad. The manager knew we had a large party (we made reservations) and assigned a new waitress to handle the table by herself. We got through half of the meal before getting our beers, and it took 30 min (not exaggerating) to get our bill. Would not go back."
1,"A year ago I'd have given them at least four stars.  The ambiance was great, cool decor, food was tasty and reasonable, service was friendly, and the beer selection was really good.  However, I've kinda given up on this place.  For the past YEAR, they've been saying that their kitchen would be open \""soon.\""  For a good month, probably 6 weeks now, they've had a sign up outside that says their kitchen will be open \""Really Soon.\""  Well... a year ain't \""soon\"" folks.  Many times I drove up from old town Scottsdale to go enjoy a few beverages and a good meal there.  But as I said, I've given up on this place.  Not quite sure how they're staying afloat anymore."
2,Sushi on Shea was a well decorated sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly but that might of been because it was so empty. I went on a Wensday night around 7 and it was completly empty. I ordered a few of there specialty rolls such as the Lobster roll and the Eel and Avocado roll. They were both good but nothing really that amazing to make me go back. They do offer other selections other than sushi.
2,"Be sure to call before driving there...the website claims they are open until 5pm but there wasn't a sign of life when I showed up at 4:30 :( I'm sure the cookies are delicious, but I did not get the opportunity to make a purchase."
1,"I was looking for a professional to help with some skin conditions. The staff said all patients first see their physicians assistant before seeing the doctor, which was fine at first but when I finally got to be seen things went awry.,  First off the PA, Rob is very quick tempered, he got upset at me for asking a question, he cut me off in mid sentence and end up prescribing the wrong medication for me.  They gave me free samples which burned my skin.  Rob the PA did not have the time to settle me down before he carved a hole in my skin, he was very insensitive. I will not go back and see him, but will see the actual medical doctor & will update on the visit with the actual doctor who I am hoping has bedside manor which Rob the PA did not.  He was very unsympathetic and was in a hurry."
4,"I have been going to Top Nails for years and can't imagine going anywhere else! I love, love, love them, Highly recommend them!"
1,"In the two times we've ordered from this place, we requested the pizza to be cut in slices and not those little squares. They never did what we asked, even when the receipt had our request on it. It really gives the impression that they don't care. The pizza itself was good, but would be better if it weren't cut into squares."
4,"What a wonderful and joyful place to visit. The owner, Judith is one of the kindess people I have ever met. She greats you with a big hug and hugs you again before she lets you leave the store (even if you don't buy anything). The way good no great customer service should be. When I leave this place I am filled with joy and happiness, and I can just feel my spirit at ease. I had my aura read while I was there, and it was all over the place (i.e.- stressed, depressed, worried and so forth). With just a few minutes with Judith, I let my guard down and opened up to her (she is just one of those people you feel like you can tell anything to) and not only did I feel the difference you could actually see the difference in the change of color of my aura. It is a wonderful place to shop again and again."
2,"Average food on a very limited menu.  Service was barely adequate, and the prices were very over-priced.  Location is convenient, but parking can be an issue.  Seems to be very popular with the trendy high school crowd [something I shied away from even when I was in high school]..."
3,"Another Food Network find.... \n\nSupposedly the best thing cheesy \""Chef Beau\"" ever had was the onion soup from here..... In looking at Zinc it boasts some local awards for its French cuisine... I am on vacation sure why not. \n\nService Stellar. Frankie was super funny, polite and ensured we felt like we were his only table. \n\nThe food: \nI did get the onion soup and it was good.Yes the crispy gruyere was yummy and the soup was good but not the best I have had....HOWEVER the scallops were probably the best I have had in a while. I got the scallops with black lentils and mustard cream... I give those two thumbs and a snap around the world. They were perfectly seared, sweet, buttery and huge. The lentils were firmer than I am used to but not unpleasant. The mustard cream was a perfect topper. We also got the parma/truffle fries were good. The fries were not greasy, crispy and the aiolis that accompanied them were a good complement. The curried chicken sandwich was well liked by my boyfriend. Other things ordered at our table: duck confit sandwich, chicken salad and house fries.  \n\nOverall: great place to grab some lunch, excellent service, don't believe the hype about the onion soup."
3,"I love this place, great food and atmosphere, but on my last visit wasn't impress with new addition to menu"
1,"Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence. \n\nNo happy hour menu. \n\n\""Communal bar table\"" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.\n\nFood is good but no thanks. Won't return."
2,"This is a great place to eat \""except\"" they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service. On occasion when my wife and I stop on for lunch, there always manages to be some issue with the food in one another's meal. Given there are 2 of us? That translates to them hitting the mark 50% of the time. The menu selection is awesome. The dark molasses indian bread with butter is worth the trip and if you can get a great service, try the appetiser salad of pecan, endive and blue cheese. The take out cheese cake cant be beat."
2,"They totally missed it!  They missed the opportunity to make our customer service experience a relaxing and carefree experience.  It happened at lunch the other day to me and my friend who was in town on business.  We arrived late in the day to avoid any crowds.  Our experience was a series of missed customer service opportunities throughout the meal.   \n\nIt began with two special orders that we placed with our server.  He wrote these requests down and made it clear that he understood what we wanted.  The order gets delivered by someone else.  When the server comes to check on the order, we let him know that both of our orders didn't reflect our requests.  He looks at the plates with a disappointing look and sweeps them away.  He delivers the special requests a few minutes later with his apologies and lets us know his manager is going to come out and \""talk\"" to us.  It sounded more like a threat than an attempt to smooth over the mishap.  The manager comes out and gives a weak apology.  Missed Customer Service Opportunity #1:  He wasn't really interested in explaining what happened to our orders or whether it was an inconvenience.\n\nSo I ask myself, who was ultimately responsible for the order, the one delivering it or the server.  The server showed his disappointment and made us think it was the one delivering the order who was at fault.  The restaurant is not busy and they have time to make sure orders get out correctly.  Where is the quality control that I see on \""Hells Kitchen\""?  Restaurants can't afford to get it wrong these days.  \n\nShortly after the entrees were delivered, our order for French fries made it to the table.  Anyone looking at the plate of fries would have noticed that they were overly salted.  We were busy talking so we didn't notice at first.  After a few bites, we both began to feel the burn in our lips from the salt.  Frustrated that they don't really care, we just didn't eat them.   Missed Customer Service Opportunity #2 :  The server never came back to check on the quality of the French fries.  Worse yet, he should have seen that they were overly salted.\n\nWe finish our meals and I request a doggie bag for my leftovers.  The server brings out a container and bag.  I asked my friend, why don't they bag the leftovers anymore?  I noticed that this is a service they no longer provide at many restaurants.  Are they concerned about contaminating my food?  They just served my meal so I don't think that's the case.  Are they too busy?  Missed Customer Service Opportunity #3:  Please, someone tell me why this little act of service is beneath them now.   \n\nI won't be returning anytime soon, sorry to say."
0,"I'm usually a fan of cheesecake factory. I've been going since I was a kid. It's usually consistent. This trip however was very different. Appetizer (spinach, artichoke, cheese dip) was good, my little ones grilled cheese was fine, but our chicken chipotle pasta was terrible. The flavor was fine, but the pasta wasn't even near cooked all the way. After we sent it away the manager said that their pasta machine was acting up! Why are they making pasta if the \""cooker\"" is broken? Can they not make pasta in an old school pot with water? I didn't ask for anything else. We ordered a key lime cheesecake to go and went home. The cheesecake was the best part of our meal."
2,"Normally, service here is excellent. But tonight? FAIL. We're regulars at the Scottsdale location; it's walking distance from home!  Well tonight we waited quite a longer time than usual for our dinner. Even the manager came over to apologize as well as our waitress. No offer of a discount on our bill, free desert, nothing! We're not the type to be verbal, but when both the mgr and waitress are aware of an issue, and does nothing for the customer....thats an even bigger disappointment. :("
2,"We only ever get the Louisiana Chicken pasta or cheesecake any more.  I think the menu is so big that it is hard for them to have any specialties (other than cheesecake).  The last 5 dishes I've had have been nothing special at all, and one I even sent back because it was so bad (and I NEVER do that)."
2,Bartender service is supposed to be fast and attentive.  At the bar and he decided to read the paper instead of pay attention to anyone. Blah.
3,Great menu and good food!
2,"It's an Einstein. The patio seating is what differentiates this location. A great destination for dog walkers. And you can pick up a doggie bagel for your pooch for a buck. There also always seem to be friendly customers anxious to interact with the canine diners.\n\nI tend to arrive late with my family. Even though they are suppose to be open until 3:00 p.m. on Sundays, they stop replenishing bagels and will run out of many of the most popular (or is it just our favorite?) bagel flavors well before that. Not unusual, but the employees seem tired of the issue and react with a take it or leave it attitude. Good luck if you arrive after 1:00, or even noon. Most other days they close at 5:00 and have the same problem, just a little later.\n\nFor the most part, however, employees are friendly here."
2,"I've stopped by this Deli for lunch and breakfast.  When I came for lunch, I ordered a 10\"" Italian Sandwich ($6.79)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=FvhTfKVsGt5FXtfjL7dgEw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=qaOSRK-FMOUZgooSqY8R4w\n\nThe Sandwich was very difficult to eat because it was served open-faced with the Meat pushing the Bread open....very strange as it made it difficult to fold back over and hold.  Also, they douse the bread with the Oil/Vinegar, so it gets soggy and breaks apart....WTH?  The taste was pretty good, but the experience sucked.  You can see what I'm talking about in my pics.\n\nThe 2nd time I stopped here, it was to try their Breakfast Burritos.....since the Max Burro was priced at $4.29, I only ordered 1 because I thought it would be huge....I was wrong, it was just a Med sized Burrito.  It was pretty good....Eggs, Bacon, Cheese, wrapped in a Tortilla.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=8gpyTOcWz6BWYTxxTc-UnA\nI was disappointed with the size though.....I was still hungry after I finished it....bummer.  I didn't think the $4.29 was worth it...I think $3.50 would be a more appropriate price for a Med sized Breakfast Burrito.\n\nOverall, I think this place has potential....right now, it only gets 3 Stars from me.\n\nReturn Factor - 67%"
1,"It was ok...Nothing special.  I ordered an italian sub, and it was served on a bun/roll...not the Italian bread that I'm used to.  I should have just gone to Jimmy Johns."
0,"I've been to Rinaldi's several times now. To me, it's one of those places that after the first bite, I get annoyed at myself for not remembering how disappointing it was the last time and wonder why I'm back.\n\nLet's cut to the chase. This place in essence is really no different than the deli counter at the low end food store down the street from wherever it is you live - and let's be honest, places like Safeway make a point of a good deli counter and put this place to shame - all at a lower cost.\n\nDon't be fooled by the quintessential \""New York\"" decor on the walls such as a photo of downtown NYC and a poster of Italian movie mobsters. I lived in New York and this is not a real NY deli. This place wouldn't make it through opening weekend.\n\n2 slices of deli meat on a thin bed of shredded lettuce, and a layer of mayo on a crumbly hoagie roll does not transport me back to Mulberry St. \n\nThe two stars are awarded to their breakfast burritos. It's pretty hard to mess up eggs."
0,"This was one bad sandwich and not really an Italian Deli at all. They have a motto saying that they have \""the biggest and best sandwiches\"", but what you get is exactly the opposite. The menu listed nothing Italian like Ziti, etc - it is just  a sandwich shop and not a good one at that. First problem on this Saturday was the cashier girl, who was new and did not know the answers to any questions we asked about the food. Who trained this individual? The next issue was the sandwich itself, but these 8 buck Wedge sandwiches are small, constructed poorly and somehow, the condiments of mayo, lettuce and tomato caused me alot of gas only 45 minutes later. This deli is a joke, not worth the money or the hype. The meat is Boars Head, but beyond that, some chains have better sandwiches than this place."
0,"Today was my last visit. The customer service is consistently poor and in a day and age where the average consumer has a multitude of meal options in front of them, what really sets places apart is how they interact with patrons. When a manager/owner is rude, abrupt and downright disrespectful to customers, what is to be assumed except that they don't value their business. \n\nI do wish them luck as a mom & pop shop. I think we need more family run eateries in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area...but Rinaldi's? It'll be an uphill battle if they choose to continue to treat their clientele in this fashion. It's too bad."
2,"Great Italian sub, also the greek salad is good too.  Customer service not so great....  We do love supporting local businesses.  Restaurant was busy for lunch  but unkept, there were picture frames and extra stuff blocking tables and on tables, so we could barely squeeze into our table from boxes etc..."
1,"Well, this place is good.  The food is kind of that outdated tropical fare and lacks any sort of innovation.  The atmosphere has that TGI fridays chain feeling to it, but instead of shit on the walls its upscale tropical.\n\nI wouldnt really go back unless i was invited by someone else."
0,"This place is absolutely disgusting. Dirty, dirty, dirty. I'd rather pay to sleep in my car. Also, the staff is very rude."
2,"I wasn't sure what to expect with all the bad reviews that I read about this place. But after staying here for 3 nights, it looks like things have improved. \n\nThe whole place underwent renovation about 3 weeks ago. My room was spacious, clean, and fairly quiet. There is construction going on next door that you can hear inside but the noise wasn't loud enough to wake me up. Soap, shampoo, and clean towels were all provided. The free WiFi worked well. The location and price are hard to beat. Search online for coupon codes.\n\nMy only complaint is that my nonsmoking room (the entire hotel is nonsmoking now) still smelled of smoke."
4,"After leaving Jos. A Banks across the parking lot where there were no coats in my size (54), I met with Stewart who happily showed me a nice selection in my size and with buy 1 get 1 free, they are tailoring both now.  Good job and great service."
1,"the service was awful. Those girls working behind the counter were anything but accommodating and helpful. \n\nI asked if I could get no ice in my smoothie and they said no it's an ice-based smoothie and if they don't put ice it's going to be like just juice.  And it's going to be cold anyway even with no ice.    \n\n1. It doesn't take you to be a rocket scientist to realize that ice temperature is at 32 F which is significantly lower than any other liquid in the fridge.\n\n 2. Ice makes smoothie having smoothie texture? Are you kidding ? Ice IS WATER. \n\nAnd yes i would  have been fine with ice but its the attitude that's unbearable. They not only did try to accommodate, but also act like i'm crazy for asking. The only thing worse than a cooperate joint is know-it-all rude hipsters.  I much prefer Starbucks to an attitude like this. Yuck. The atmosphere was nice, but the customer service ruins everything."
3,"I made an appointment at the last minute for a haircut on a Sunday.  I wanted a simple cut because I'm the type of gal who gets a haircut at the last minute when I can't stand it.  I believe that a style can last a long time and grow out if the cut is great.  I do have another stylist I go to who I love at another salon, but this time just wanted an in between cut where I did not want to spend the money on a salon owner's price.  I didn't expect much just a fixer upper to get me through until I could get back to my other stylist for a \""real\"" cut.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the results from Staci.  It turned out to better than I expected.  I will go back to her.  When I get a good cut, I am a happy gal.  I picked up some concealer which I was able to test and much preferred over another department store brand I had.  Bonus on the cut and the product!\n\nupdate: My daughter and I continue to go to Ulta routinely for our haircuts, and they continue to do a fabulous job.  I went for the first time to Danielle and had a very nice cut and was again very pleased.  I've since only go to here now and no longer go to my other stylist.  Honestly, I feel like the cut gets better and better each time as the stylists get to you know you.  Great job!"
0,"Thank you, for treating me like a criminal.\n\nOnce upon a time, I purchased a beautiful pair of Cole Haan boots from here.  OK, it was two pairs but who's counting?  However, when I tried to repeat that lucky find on another visit, things went downhill fast.\n\nAfter wandering through and finding nothing worth even trying on, I headed out the door at the same time that a man (who I think works there) with a large box was coming in.  The security alarm went off, but since I didn't touch/linger over/try on/purchase anything I paused briefly then just kept walking.  Mistake.  The woman behind the counter ran out of the store yelling \""you need to come back in here RIGHT NOW!\"".  Ummm... people are staring... I go back inside with her, and she gives me a kind of up-down look and says she has to see the inside of my purse.  I can't hold it open and let her see, she has to take it from me and paw through it on the counter.  Really?  You think I took something?  The outfit I am wearing (grown-up business clothes, by the way) is fitted and does not have pockets and the purse (not one of my usual suitcase-sized bags) is very small.  Where, exactly, did she think I was hiding merchandise?  Did I somehow fit a pair of stilettos in my bra?  WTF!?  Finding nothing, she proceeds to lecture me on the importance of removing the magnetic security tags from inside clothing since they set off her alarm.  Um, I don't have any of those but gee, thanks for the helpful information.  Hmmm... do you think maybe the guy coming in with the box set off your alarm and not me?  \n\nThere are plenty of other places to feed my footwear habit without being completely embarrassed."
2,"My mom loves it. My daughter loves it. I like it. \n\nTheir lunch special is a great deal; one evening I went in for a late dinner and was offered the lunch special price if I wanted less food. That was actually impressive to see that they would offer lower pricing way after the lunch hours. So that's a plus.\n\nThings to try: \n\nCalamari appetizer: Just enough spice to make you drink the recommended daily amount of water. Tossed with red peppers and spices that will make you wish you didn't have to share with the table. \n\nSpicy Shrimp Chow Mein: Jalapenos make this dish S-P-I-C-Y...a good thing! The noodles may be a bit overdone with a tad too much sauce, but overall it's a good dish. \n\nThai Coconut Soup: This is delicious. Brimming with veggies, and several floating pieces of chicken and shrimp. Must try.\n\nThe place can get a bit noisy on some days but it's affordably priced and a nice break from having to cook at home. One and a half thumbs up."
2,"I happend to find this place as I was itching for some sake and left very satisfied. \n\nGrub a dub- I find it sometimes hard to eat asian food , unless sushi or sashimi is involved, because I always feel so full after, but this place is different , slightly smaller portions , with fitting prices. The hot and sour soup intantly became greatness to me.\n\nService- I guess i went at a weird time as I was the only one in the place , so every thing came out fast and hot.But you can tell the server was about to leave and kept rushing away to do her final things.:(\n\nThe Get up- kinda standard look to the place , blacks and red stark asain decor . nothing new or stand out. but not cheesy either.\n\nAll in all, ill go again but probably wont suggest it when headed out with friends."
2,"This place is hit or miss. Luckily, the last time I went was a hit with the yellow curry with chicken. \n\nI have been coming here for about 4 or 5 years. When momma is in the house, the food is generally better. (Flo) Come in for Saturday lunch special for $5. Yes, I said $5. All the special entrees come with salad. Reg. $7.50-8.50 during the week. \n\nI also like the pad thai and spicy chicken chow mein. It has these tiny but potent jalapenos. Man, it has the burn, but really probably my second favorite dish. If you do not like spicy, stay away from that one!"
1,"Food is OK - sometimes good - used to be great.  The service is terrible and a 25 minute wait for lunch on Saturday at 1:00?  Seriously?  It seems the restaurant relies on takeout - hostess ignored folks waiting to get on the wait list (irony intended) to serve carryout customers - could the tips have an influence?\nWe were finally seated - had Shrimp Pad Thai and Red Chicken Curry - the curry was very good, but shrimp was overcooked and the dish tasted substantially different from last visit.  The restaurant is incredibly loud, to the point of distracting.  \nWe used to go here often, but will be eating at other places from now on when Saturday shopping."
0,"Service was slow and fairly apathetic, I'd expect a little better on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nI'd heard plenty about Flo's, mostly good, so I was excited to try it. The salad that came before lunch was cafeteria-grade iceberg. Dressing was tasty, though. My entree was shrimp with bacon, cabbage, and tomato. It tasted okay, nothing special though.\n\nThe reason I'm giving them one star, though, is because something in this meal (I'm assuming shrimp) made me sick, and I'm still paying for it two days later. Far from impressed, and I won't be coming back."
2,"They have excellent food, but the portions are average to small and the pricing is expensive for this type of cuisine. I'm not sure I would go again compared to other options I have for chinese food. The staff was average as well. I'd like to see better staff and bigger portions in the future if I were to go again."
2,"If you're hungry for Asian, by all means go. It's a nice restaurant with a very pleasant staff. \n\nThe food is good and tasted fresh. The Coconut Curry Soup is good, the pad thai was not among the best I've had but it was satisfying... The Tom Yun Gun was way too salty."
4,"For the second year in a row the boyfriend and I have enjoyed a summer staycation at the Westin Kierland Resort. Even though it's only about 30 minutes from our house in Tempe the Westin Kierland makes us feel like we are away on vacation.\n\nThe resort is very large with lots of comfortable places to relax, dine or explore. The have two large pools, one is for families and includes a lazy river and the other is an adult only pool, which is what we opted for. The pool area is really pretty and kept very clean. There are a ton of chairs so you don't have to worry about getting out there early to get a seat. There are also a lot of umbrellas so you can find shade even on the sunniest of summer days.\nThey also have a pool waiter walking around making sure you have plenty of ice water or you can order drinks and food. I love being waited on at the pool!\n\nThe rooms are pretty large with their heavenly bed. They are on par with the other Westin's I have stayed at.\n\nRight next door is an outdoor shopping center that has a lot of really great places to eat as well so you'll never be at a loss for things to do or eat.\n\nI would recommend the Westin Kierland to anyone from out of town or   to anyone in town who wants an easy weekend escape."
2,"Wednesday, Girls' day for 4 (two rooms)\n\nReservations-Making reservations = not seamless, took two phone calls and a facebook post to recover the summer deal on the rooms.\n\nCheck-in...this hotel was desolate!  The pools, restaurants, halls, grounds were an expected AZ summertime wasteland.  Yet they stuck us with two rooms with a less-desirable view.  What?  You can't spare a golf course view or an upgrade during your 'off' season?  All four of our room keys failed, for two different doors, nothing like having to phone down and then WAIT!!!\n\nConcierge - left us messages to come see her for a special Starwood gift.  It was an apple shaped cookbook of apple recipes...ummm, I appreciate the thought, but what the heck does this have to do with AZ, Spa retreat, or luxury resort???  She also had unrelenting eye contact.  Very odd experience.\n\nRoom - nice and neat.  Upon one use of toilet (#1 just so you know!), the toilet overflowed, which then had us calling for a handy-man and again another WAIT!!! \n\nSpa - \n+ 30% off services for Phoenix residents on Wednesday!\n+ massage was awesome!!!!\n- small, scratchy spa towels\n- showers aren't the mulit-flow (rainforest) showers like most spas (disappointed with that)\n- hot tub right next to the restrooms, ewww!\n- It took FOREVER for the receptionist to charge 4 massages to one room number...again, another WAIT!!!  \n\nPools...\nAdult Pool\n- Cabana reserved...NO other Cabana's reserved and they gave us the worst one, furthest form the pool.  What????  We moved, of course, but these are LOW rent Cabana's...I know this isn't Vegas, but 4 chairs, a table, a fan, and some iced water for $80??  \n- Bird POOP everywhere...on the chairs, on the umbrella's, on our clothes...ewwwwh!\n- Got 2 Midori margarita's in and they ran out of Midori.  WHAT kind of place is this???  \n+ Coco, the pool guy was awesome!!  Very friendly, searched the grounds to get us another bottle of Midori, and took off the Cabana charge for our trouble.  That is good service!!  We love Coco!!\n\nKids Pool\n+ The good thing was that there were hardly any kids so we could do the slides and lazy river with no trouble.  Don't get me wrong, I like kids, I have 2, but not when it is a girls' day.\n+ Slide was fun.\n- Tons of teens working their summer job...more interested in chatting it up with co-workers or totally uninterested/bored with the whole thing.\n\nHousekeeping...ignored the do not disturb and busted in on us around 9ish then argued with us about it.  So much for sleeping in!\n\nIf this is how it is during the 'off' season, what is it like when this place is hoppin'?  \n\nIt was OK, but did not live up to the hype of a Westin or Scottsdale resort."
2,"Way over priced!\n\nIt is a nice hotel, but not for the price you pay...at these rates you could have creme de la creme at a Ritz. I will say everybody was really nice and friendly. The room is nice, but the sheets a little rough. The pools are okay. For me the pools and the building are not that asethically appealing and kind of blah. Loved seeing the bunnies on the way to the pool. The running trail I thought would go around the golf course it nothing but a trail along the main roads...disappointed so I turned back. The Nellie restaurant was bad and the menu at the pool is very small and not fantastic but decent...again not what is expected at the caliber of a hotel such as this. I did love the bagpipes in the evenings. \n\nMehhh I will try another resort if I ever go back to Scottsdale."
1,"The rooms are very so so and the hospitality was non existent, I will not be going back!,"
3,Nice hotel and friendly staff.  A nice place to get away for a few days.
4,"wow!  such a beautiful place!  from the golf course to the bars and outside patio, it's great.  We went there for Infusioncon and it was awesome!"
4,best ever massage I have ever had! xoxoxo
1,"Not worth it. Some weird, offensive smell throughout entire hotel. Gym was packed constantly. Way more kids at resort than I expected.  \nLobby and bar area, pretty. Golf prices, just too high.\nHotel leaves a message at your  room saying \""come down and pick up your free gift\"" but your free gift is really a ploy to get you to buy a timeshare. BRUTAL!"
4,"Nordstrom's rack, oh how I love thee! As a budget and fashion conscious mommy of 5 little shopping protege's, this store allows me to fill my closet with all I desire, and not bust my bank account. I love my jeans, and the Rack is one of the only places with a fantastic selection of Seven for all Mankind, with prices between $70-$100, a far cry from Saks $225+. I scored a $210 Michael Stars dress for $29.97,  and at the same price, a great comfy pair of Sofft wedge heal sandals. Lots of cute kids tees by Trunk, Junk Food, etc, all at rock bottom prices, even found some BCBG items that were well over 50% off, and they are items that can all currently be found at the BCBG boutique at Kierland. My bohemian side adores the racks of Free People they get in on a regular basis, and the little girls Flowers by Zoe. if you're in the mood to dig, and want some looks for decent prices, check it out. Granted, the prices aren't as cheap as TJ Maxx, but I far prefer the variety at the Rack."
4,best place to buy shoes
3,"Nordstrom Rack is always a cool place to go. You can find things that you saw at Nordstroms not too long ago for a great price.\nMen.s clothes, shoes, belts, and other rick rack is always fun to scout out here for.  This store is clean,and neat,and well put together.\nYou can use your Nordstrom Credit Card here as well.\nWhen you shop here with your Nordstrom card you are also racking up your points to get your Nordstrom Notes. We all know that those are a major plus as well.\n\nGive it a go. Come on down and give it the once over.\nYou will be glad you did. Even the ladies love this place, can you believe that! Hehee"
0,"THE WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!! Beware of Mario, he is out for himself and could give a da** about anything else. Communication is not in his vocabulary because he does not email, call or return any messages. His assistant Tomi is just as bad, you will never get anywhere with this company. We rented a condo with this so called Scottsdale luxury rentals, so obviously maintenance is included with that. It took them 3 days to get someone to fix our air conditioning in 110 degree weather!!! He scheduled a walk through and forgot to mention that is was canceled, he is such a huge inconvenience. When the bills are due if your not on time they will be on your tail calling and emailing.  They are quick to take payment but to return the deposit was impossible. They will take every penny if you let them, get a lawyer by your side, because you will need one!"
3,Good dry cleaning at a great price. \nThis place is simple and good. The staff is efficient and gets down to business. They have successfully saved a few of my blouses from my clumsy stains.\nOne tip is to be sure to pay with cash. They accept debit cards too but charge a $.50 processing fee.
1,"The concept is amazing, and I probably set my hopes too high for this little joint. Watching a movie and enjoying full service food and drink at the push of a button? What's not to love?\n\nTurns out, just about everything. The execution was totally off. We were the only people in the theater but somehow the service still sucked. The food was mediocre. The second run movies were mediocre, but plenty entertaining after a couple glasses of wine, which were offered at a decent price.\n\nI guess it's the cheap bastard gene in me that has a problem with this place. I nearly bust a nut when I have to pay full price at a regular theater and shell out for their snacks, let alone drop double the amount on a crappier second run version of the same theater fare. \n\nI'll stick to catching the drive-in double feature with my own bottle o' wine and snacks, rather than return to this place and shell out obscene amounts of money on freezer-burned puff pastry and vino."
2,"I do love this store. I have a coworker and her condo looks amazing, which she told me she decorated it almost entirely with things from this store.  I love their accent pillows, currants, candles, etc.  Seems to me like more of a store you go to for adding decor and accent type of things.  So if you purchased a living room set somewhere else and wanted to add cute pillows, lamps, throw blanket, rug, and curtains, then you could come here.\n\nThe down side is this place is expensive.  I found the perfect shade of navy blue curtains here I couldn't find anywhere else.  Exactly what I envisioned so it was hard changing my mind about anything, but they were hundreds of dollars for curtains.  Perhaps that's the standard, I wouldn't know because everywhere I've lived always came with blinds and I recently bought my first home that was set up for curtains.  But I feel like for $200 I could add a few hundred more on for wood blinds at another store that would last me many years.\n\nMy coworker ended up finding some beautiful silver lanterns that were between $60-$140 each piece and they weren't that big.  Considering the hefty cost she turned them away which was smart to do.\n\nAnother reason I just gave them 3 stars and not more is I've been here about 2 times on my own, 6 times with friends and not once has a store worker ever approached us to ask us if we needed help with anything.  In fact, I'm honestly not sure what the workers look like because I really can't remember seeing anyone there.  Do they wear street clothes, business attire, uniforms? I really don't know.  Not that I like being harassed, stalked, annoyed, and followed while shopping with workers giving me their unwanted opinions about what I should buy.  But it doesn't hurt to make an appearance after 15 minutes to make sure the customer doesn't need anything."
1,"Two stars does feel a bit harsh for rating this place, but the description fits perfectly. \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" Three stars would be \""A-OK,\"" which I don't feel describes my experience here at all.\n\nIt's not that anything was particularly bad or offensive. It just wasn't great. The roll I got before eating was harder than I would have liked, but the pesto/olive oil that came with it was quite pleasant. On the recommendation of the server, I got one of their chef's special dishes, the Ciambotta Di Pollo e Salsiccia. Again, nothing was wrong with it. It was good and I plowed my way through it quickly. However, it was far from gourmet. The sauce, while it tasted fine, was hardly distinguishable from something from a jar. The chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes. Then the biggest problem with the whole experience was the price. For my lunch of only iced tea and an entree, I paid just over $20 after tax and tip. Now I don't have a problem with paying $20 for a meal, not at all. But for that price, I expect quality. What I got did not at all match up with that expectation.\n\nI have nothing against this restaurant. I wasn't at all put off by the meal. But I can get better at Olive Garden for a lower price. I can call to mind several family-owned Italian restaurants with higher quality and lower prices. So I'll be taking my money to those."
2,"A bit disappointed so writing after only one exploratory visit and a revisit for the one dish that deserved an encore.\n\nThe Ossobucco was the major disappointment, A beautiful Presentation that lacked flavor and was past overcooked. One of my favorite dishes when prepared correctly, but they just missed - badly!\n\nOn the plus side the Gnocchi were little pillows of wonderfulness! Reminded me on our neighborhood  \""little Italian lady\"" who made it for me as a child over 60 years ago and was, until now, the very best I have ever had. This version was very close and was served with a wonderful four cheese white sauce (calorie free for certain!). The Caesar Salad was a decent rendition but nothing I have eaten here approached the Gnocchi, unfortunately.\n\nWorth the trip for the Gnocchi alone!"
2,"This is a good Italian restaurant, but I'm going to have it bring it down from 4 stars to 3 after our most recent visit. \n\nThe owner is incredibly friendly, but the hostess this past weekend was fairly rude to my wife.  She seemed very busy, so it could have been that, but since we don't encounter rudeness at Scottsdale restaurants too often, I thought it was important to note.\n\nService is very quick, since they have a team wait on you.  One person brings the bread, another takes your order, and another fills up waters.  You may not see your actual server very often, but that allows you to focus on the food.\n\nThe food, for the most part, is great.  Portions aren't too big, especially considering what you pay, but you likely won't be disappointed.  Just keep in mind the Calamari isn't fried, so if that's what you're expecting, steer clear."
0,Omigosh! We had reservations and they have COMPLETELY ignored us. Even let another group ahead of us. The hostess is rude and condescending. I will never come here again nor would I recommend this place to anyone.  We are still standing here 45 minutes after we should have been seated!
0,"The customer was absolutely terrible, the front of the house was poor and the server gave us truly bad customer service 1/10. Mary was our server. It was like pulling teeth to ask for chicken cutlets for our 3 yr old Son, and they charged us $7 for 3 of the tiniest chicken cutlets (it was really one cutlet split into smaller pieces) with no side for him. \n\nThe beef carpaccio was awful. The beef was over cured, it was like eating salami, and they drenched the arugula with dressing. Worst carpaccio I have ever had.\n\nEven The pesto for the bread was awful\n\nThe main entrees were ok, we had the eggplant rolled with ricotta and the parradella pasta with sausage. Not bad, but my entree was $21 and the quality of the food did not merit that.\n\nTerrible dining experience, definitely will not go back"
4,"They carry the best products.  Their staff is like one big family and getting your hair or nails done is like a social event.  They are reasonably priced, in a great location, clean, friendly and accommodating!  If you're looking for a new salon call them and they will have the stylist you're looking for."
2,"Pretty standard issue sports bar. The place is pretty large and spread out which is nice, but we went late on a weeknight and there weren't too many people around. Seems like the kind of place a locals have been going to for years. Little dark, a little divey but not dirty or unpleasant. Beer selection wasn't great but the wings made it worth the trip. The wings were great. I live in the area and I imagine I'll be back here sometime soon."
4,"Love love LOVE IT!\n\nI first went here with a friend when I was visiting Scottsdale and now that I live here I go here regularly.  The service is great and they always remember you.  I hadnt been there for a year and the guy bartender welcomed me and even remembered my drink (maybe I drink too much) lol.  \n\nRay is a wonderful host and his band is just great.  Sure enough...I went home and looked at the back of my Lyle Lovett CD's and I think he's on each and every one of them!  How cool!  The music is great and if you like to dance country this is the place.  Lots of sweet people here too and if you are looking to meet new friends, Handlebar J is great for that.\n\nLastly...the food is awesome.  The BBQ is out of this world and even though the pricing isnt great, the quality is.  \n\nSee you soon new friends.  Thanks for being exactly what I was looking for in AZ."
4,"Dr. Besemer,  Dr. Kieran, and their entire staff are truly amazing, compassionate animal caregivers. \n\nWhen my two-year-old kitty became extremely ill during this past weekend, we were able to get him examined by Dr. Besemer on Sunday. At that point, we had no idea what the issue was, and all of the blood work and tests came back in the normal range (the doctor took the time to work him in between surgeries and sit down with us for an extremely thorough review of our kitty's test results and examination findings). We took the kitty home for the night with meds to ease his tummy issues, but the next morning it was quite apparent that the little guy was getting worse. \n\nWe took him back in (after calling the staff, who was very willing to get him in ASAP), and he got another thorough exam, this time by Dr. Kieran, as Dr. Besemer was booked in surgeries. All of the kitty's history had been communicated to Dr. Kieran, and she recommended x-rays. (It should be noted at this point that at every step we were given a complete write-up of treatment recommendations and their costs, the pros and cons of each, and given full control over what we thought was the correct thing to do based on all of the facts.) We chose to get the x-rays done, and about 10 minutes later, Dr. Kieran went over the entire picture with us and explaining what we were seeing. There was a suspicious-looking, but not blatantly apparent spot around the kitty's intestinal area. We were given the choice of getting an ultrasound or going in that afternoon for exploratory surgery. Again, both procedures, their associated risks, and costs (very reasonable financing terms are available) were immediately and thoroughly communicated to us. We chose surgery, and Dr. Kieran took him right in. We went home to wait for an update on our beloved kitty's condition. We were told how long to expect the surgery to last, and were told that we could call at any time for a status update. (Never once were we treated like a bother.)\n\nRight around the time they had estimated, we were called by Dr. Kieran, who told us the surgery went well and they had removed an obstruction from our kitty's intestine. We were given a choice whether to pick him up and keep him overnight ourselves or keep him at the clinic for IV fluids and monitoring. (The clinic does not have 24-hour staff, but recommended 24 hour care nearby or what we could do to care for him ourselves throughout the night.) We chose to take him home and bring him back in early the next morning for an all-day stay to make sure he was well-hydrated and get him started eating again. They wrapped up the little catheter on his front paw so they did not have to stick him with another needle the next morning. They gave him all the medications he'd need in the evening before we left and in the morning after we brought him back, except for pain meds to keep him comfortable during the night. We were even able to see the object that was causing the obstruction, which ended up being a large hairball that had dried and hardened in the middle and lodged in there. \n\nThat night was rough sleep wise for me, but it was worth it to see my kitty making a speedy recovery. In the morning I dropped him off, and when I picked him up in the evening, the transformation was amazing. We were given after-care instructions, food, medication, and happily brought him home last night.  \n\nDr. Kieran called this morning to see how the kitty was doing and answer any questions I had. He is making quite a speedy recovery, which is an incredible sight after how sick the little guy was.\n\nI have been a cat owner all my life, and have rarely experienced the level of compassion and knowledge that the doctors and staff at Scottsdale Hills Animal Hospital provided. As long as I live in or around Phoenix, this is where I will be taking my pets from now on. They are true animal lovers, and it shows!"
3,"I was wandering around the shopping center at Shea and Scottsdale Road at lunch trying to decide what to eat.  I noticed a little Italian Deli, and was amazed  - it was before noon and the placed was packed.  I went in and before I looked at the menu, I wandered around looking at the diners and their plates.  The diners were very mixed - professionals,  construction workers, couples, singles, and groups. They all seemed to have something different, and they all seemed to be enjoying what they were eating.  \n\nSo I decided to give it a try.  The person who took my order spoke heavily accented Italian, but I managed to convey what I wanted, which was really simple - an Italian Sub with salami, Mortadella, Pepperoni & Provolone.  It was packed with onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, and drenched in sub oil.  It was great, delicious - made me aware of what I had been missing all my life - and more than filled me up.\n\nMy only disappointment was that I was full - I wanted to try everything on their menu, because everything looked so tempting.  But they are close to my home, so I'm sure it will become my lunchtime favorite.\n\nI only gave them 4 stars, since I only had the sandwich.  But I will update as I visit them again and try their complete menu, which also includes salads, pasta, pizza, and different kinds of subs."
0,Just the worst. Owner was ranting in the back and humiliating his staff. So nasty and so rude.
1,Fresh and good but the actual hot dog on the Chicago dog tastes like one from the grocery store. Meets the craving for Chicago but not completely.
4,"I loved this place before I even got in the front door. Very good prices, and well organized.  The owner is so friendly.  It seemed like every item of fabulous clothing I picked up was on sale for half price.  I am definitely a regular now!!!"
3,"Great selection, clean, and good prices.  Nice jewelry selection too."
4,"This restaurant gets 5 stars!!!  \n\nWe went here for Father's Day, and I wasn't sure what to think at first.  I looked over the menu before we went so I could decide what to get.  \n\nAfter getting to Tutti Santi (cute, quaint, family owned place) I was excited to sit down and eat.  They had some specials, so we got some ravioli appetizer and bread, and it was amazing, everyone had seconds! \n\nOur salads came out promptly with delicious dressing and fresh lettuce and vegetables.  \n\nWe waited a bit for our entrees, but we werent even really worried about it, and then the manager came out to apologize for the delay, and about 10 minutes later our food arrived.  I got Chicken fiorentina, which was lightly breaded chicken with a white cream sauce and sauteed spinach.  OMG, it was the best thing I have tasted!!!!\n\nWhen we were all finished, the manager came out with a complimentary slice of cheesecake for the delay and offered my dad a shot of sambuca.  \n\nGreat service, fun atmosphere and I will definitely be back to enjoy another one of their delicious meals."
3,The food was very good but I wasn't crazy about the stuffed mushrooms! They weren't bad but they weren't great either! I had veal franchese and it was very good. The veal melted in your mouth and the flavor was outstanding. It comes with pasta with tomato sauce which wasn't bad. The caesar salad with anchovies was really good and they pour a very healthy glass of wine! I ain't mad at 'em! :)
1,"Tried to have a romantic dinner at this place with m y wife. Food was great, but the service not so good. Rude wait staff. Maybe a Jersey thing?? but I'm from Jersey and wasn't feeling the love..."
3,"Oh, Anthropologie, how I love thee!  And, oh how I love thee sales even more. I must say, this particular Anthropologie has been my lucky store, as I've been able to find on numerous occasion fabulous deals on clothes.  Just recently, I bought a cute summer dress and skirt for about half-off their original price.  Their houseware and gift items are adorable too and definitely a great way to go for a fantastically unique gift for a girlfriend, sister, mother, etc. My only complaint, and the only reason I give the store four stars, is the clothes are a little pricey.  They are definitely cute and unique, but most of them are made from cotton, which begs the questions... when did cotton t-shirts start costing $55?"
0,"Okay the staff was some what friendly. The software they use for their mailing is terrible!!! Couldn't find any addresses even though google maps did. Overpriced as well, they just try and charge you the most expensive deal! What the heck. I dropped off and mailed a package a week ago. Just got a confirmation email that it was mailed. Over a week ago! The package should have been mailed the next day via USPS and would have been there already. Just go to the Post Office, fed ex or a real UPS store."
3,"Morton's has a fine reputation, and for the most part it lives up to it. The Steaks are sublime, though I wasn't as keen on the asparagus or potatoes here... I am not sure their prices are always in line.\n\nThe drinks are all top shelf and worth every penny."
2,"Bought by corporate Landry's (and the Camelback location closed) this former steak giant is headed south, and fast.\n\nWhat do you think about when you think, \""Morton's\""?\n--strangely tan vinyl booths (yes, I've seen them in Chicago, and I finally get it)\n--sinatra standards\n--bow ties\n--to be shown what a beefsteak tomato looks like (from the cart)\n--to be shown what a life lobster looks like (the poor kiddo)\n--to be shown what a porterhouse looks like (oh, YUM)\n--crabcakes\n--AND THE BEST DARNed steak you can get in town, _no matter the cut_\n--don't forget the sprigs of watercress, my favorite.\n\nBut Landry's isn't having it. A multi-million dollar brand is taking a new direction:\n#no more Sinatra\n#no more cart\n#maitre'd has no tux\n#limited Champagne options; $160 Tatt is a plain ripoff.\n\nSteakhouses are a dime-a-dozen these days and with Eddie V's nearby putting on the Ritz with live jazz and magnums of the Heitz Martha's Vineyard _besides great steaks_, Landry's Morton's won't be here for long."
2,Not my fav place prob like #7 on my list however a great lunch spot late in the afternoon its usaully empty. I like there lettuce wrap thing o and they have alcohol there too after being in Barnes & Noble for hours I get hungry and thirsty what can I say!?!? The one in awhatukee bluuuu 100x worse food wise but thats another review =)
2,"I feel like Ra is too focused on social and not sushi. Good for groups, and decent happy hour prices. Lots of cute waitresses too."
2,"Fun Americanized sushi bar.  Usually packed with a 30-something crowd at the bar.  Loud music.  Sushi is average, but what you would expect from a place like this.  Service is good.  If you want drinks with some sushi on the side, this is a great place.  If you want authentic, try Hiro Sushi instead."
4,"The sushi at RA is beyond amazing!  I eat sushi about 3 times a week and if I could eat at RA evertime, I WOULD!  Happy Hour rocks and there's some really awesome stuff on the HH menu!  Absolutely love it!"
0,"Food was mediocre. Service was terrible. After getting served our unsweet tea, the waitress disappeared for 10 minutes. No sugar/sweet & low/splenda. Her excuse? We ordered unsweet tea, so she figured we would not want any sweetener. I explained that means I don't want it PRE-sweetened. Took our order, disappeared. Edamame was terrible. Salad & soup mediocre. Sushi sampler was not marked as spicy but somehow had wasabi hidden under each piece of fish. Meat was mediocre. Waitress disappeared again. \n\nWhen she came back, she said that her sister had her car with a dead battery and she had to leave, and the manager would take care of us. Nobody ever came by the table.\n\nI wandered the restaurant to find someone to refill my tea. I showed the manager, she walked away. Waiting for the replacement sushi without wasabi took forever. I asked the manager how long does it take to make RAW FISH? No response. No apologies. No discount off the bill. \n\nWhen I asked for the bill, the waitress that supposedly had to leave to do something with her sister/car brought us the bill. Odd, thought she had to leave and could not take care of us with the same level of disservice that she had done so far.\n\nWasted $33 and over an hour and will not return. \n\nThe reason the restaurant is quiet is that we saw very few people actually eating there. That should have been our first sign. Waiting for the waitress to order, we finally got up to leave and she happened to show up as we were heading towards the door. That was our 2nd sign, we should have kept walking. When we finally left after this bad experience, we saw other restaurants nearby that seemed to be full of people eating and enjoying themselves. Pick one of those and save your time and money."
1,"We came here for the much touted Happy Hour. Pricing was OK. We ordered appetizers, a couple of rolls, and a couple of orders of Sushi.  The service was excellent! Our server was pretty attentive. \n\nThe beef short ribs and shrimp tempura were pretty tasty.  The tempura and calamari rolls were good..............\n\nThe nigiri suishi was sliced pretty thinly.  I kind of expected to see a Japanese suishi chef at a Japanese restaurant.........not one in sight.  The chef didn't even know how to hold a suishi knife properly. I was kind of suprised to hear so much spanish spoken behind the suishi bar.  The suishi chef acted irritated whenever we ordered a dish. \n\nWe ended the evening with a tempura cinnamon ice cream concotion. Tasty dish!\n\nIts really loud here.........so if you are looking for a nice quiet evening, this is not he place to come to..............."
3,"Reasonable prices, great service, unique and delicious rolls.  This one is also in a great location right in Kierland Commons.  I consider myself very picky when it comes to sushi and this is a place I am very appreciative of having recommended to me.  I am a true fan of RA!"
1,"Poor service - Dirty tables and they waited until after my order was in for 20 minutes to tell me they didn't have the item I ordered. I have to request a menu to order something else and then they told me there would be a wait because their kitchen was backed up. The food I did order was not very good, very inconsistent."
4,Recently I drove by the area looking for a quick stop to get my nails done. I was pleasantly surprised by the service i received. From the moment I walked in a was greeted and shown to a chair right away. Their wide variety of nail colors made it hard to choose! During the service I got my first gel mani and pedi with callus removal done at the same time which was great because I was in a time restraint without them even knowing I was. Even though I was getting two services done at the same time I never felt a sense of urgency or rush from the salon techs. Two weeks later my nails and toes still look great! I will continue to return to this very friendly and welcoming place!
0,"I can't really write a very detailed description on this because we stayed only for 10 minutes. After walking in and finding that my husband and I were the youngest in there, by like 30 years, we had one round of nasty tasting drinks and left.  \n\nOn a plus, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere not so much. We didn't get a chance to taste the food."
2,"I go here often for lunch so I figured I would write a little something about it... Love the hot sauce and the food is pretty good! I've been here at night time also to play a little trivia. \n\nAll in all, it's not the most fancy place to go but its a good spot if you want to have some lunch, do a little off track betting or just go for some drinks and food after work. Definitely filled with locals but all are friendly. Quite a few TVs if you want to see a game."
4,"Warm, friendly ....  nice and reliable and conveniently located inside PV Mall."
2,"I want to give this place more stars, but I can't...\n\nAfter 6 years we finally made it to Havana Cafe due to our recent Groupon purchase...YAY! We always wanted to try it out but the prices always scared us away. \n\nWhen we arrived on a Saturday night we were surprised that the place wasn't extremely busy. I told the hostess \""2 please\"" and she said do you have reservations? \""Umm no, do we need them\"" (as I looked around the half empty place)?!\n\nShe said my wait would be about 20 mins, fine, it's Saturday night. We sat at the bar for about 15 mins before the bartender even looked at us. She finally said are you eating dinner at the bar? \""No.\"" That was it. \n\nWe finally were seated but it was at the back of the place. My husband and I ordered our drinks. Our server asks as loud as she possibly can for our IDs...ok sure no problem, but did you have to announce it to the half empty room that you are checking our age?! For the record, we are way over 21! \n\nOur food took FOREVER to arrive. We said the wait better be worth it and you know what...IT WAS! We ordered the Maduros Fritos,  Bistecs Cubanos with smothered onions and Masas de Puerco Fritas both with beans and rice. The meat was tender, the rice was moist and the fried plantains were sweet!  We did try desert, bread pudding and would not order that again. \n\nWe'll probably go back at some point, but we will definitely make reservations and we'll be hitting up lunch for the lower prices!  :)"
0,I signed up with Yelp just to write this review. My wife and I moved to AZ recently and we were happy to find a place which sold Cuban and Puerto Rican food. All the dishes we ordered were disgusting!  The fried meat (carne frita) that she ate was dry and flavorless. The mofongo she had was unlike any other we have ever tried. She asked me to try and I just couldn't swallow it. We both love mofongo so that was very disappointing. It doesn't end there my dish was the Puerto Rican plate so I was excited and thought it would bring back some memories of my hometown but it only brought back nightmares. The rice with pigeon peas (arroz con gandules) had way too much tomato sauce... I can go on forever but would rather not. I will just jump to the desert. We thought maybe since the meal was so horrible maybe they could redeem themselves with an awesome flan. When we ordered the flan the waitress said they did not have the large portion but she  could give us the two smaller portions. We said OK but to our surprise the flan was so pale and the taste was so bland. I looked at it carefully and noticed that it had the recycling symbol on it. Who does that!!!  Come on really?!?  I'm done with this place. I would never eat at this restaurant even if they paid me. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless I hated them.
1,"Arrived here around lunch time and the place was charming, but was completely empty. There wasn't even a waitress anywhere in sight. We seated ourselves and a couple minutes later the waitress came out. At first I thought why is this place so empty, but I would find out soon enough. The waitress was moody and gave us attitude when we asked her questions almost as if we were stupid for asking. We had a living social coupon and no where on it did it say that we had to order from the dinner menu, but apparently that was the case. We ordered our food, Cuban sandwich, mussels, arroz con pollo, and a salad. It was good, but not great for the prices we were paying. Just as an example the Cuban sandwich is $15...I think I paid $6 out $7 for a really good Cuban sandwich in Miami. Sad to say I probably will not be going back."
4,I have eaten here many times over the years but forgot to write a review before now. The service and food are always excellent. My favorite dish is the pork with beans and rice and a wonderful au jus. Fresh lime slices that just go perfectly with it. Fresh iced tea with mango. I always get a side order of the plantains too. They give you wonderful island bread for no extra charge.  I used to live in the Caribbean and know their food is authentic and very well done. Generous portions.\nMy only complaint is that they have gotten me completely hooked on mojitos!! I had my first one there and now I just can't stop craving them. \nNice toe-tapping Cuban music. Not snooty fancy but very nice casual. You feel like you're on a patio instead of in an enclosed room.
1,"Cheesy, outdated decor, sky high prices with service that does not match, so so food. Went here on a recommendation and because they have home made gluten free pasta. Sorry we did. Our server was very proud of the fact that he knew we were gluten free and knew how to take care of us. I reminded him again when salads were ordered. Mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned, he said, it's a cracker stick, like that was okay. When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta. Dirty dishes were not removed in a timely manner nor were water glasses filled. Just an odd, outdated place. Felt like I was back in Jersey, without the good food."
4,"Allure is awesome! The salon is always clean, the staff is friendly, and their prices are reasonable. I live about 15 miles from Allure, but make the drive there whenever I want my nails done or need a wax because nobody else does as good of a job as Allure. Get your eyebrows waxed by Jen! I've been going to her for 2 years and she's the only person I trust with my brows. She does a great job, keeps them full & natural looking, but cleans them up nicely.\n\nAlso: Bring cash to tip because you can't write in a tip on your credit card receipt!"
2,"Gonna give it another shot.\n\nIt was a Tuesday morning.  I got up late and was running waaaaay behind schedule.  I needed something quick to eat on the way to a morning meeting, so pulled up the handy Yelp mobile app and found this spot just a stone's throw away.  \n\nI walked in and the first thing that hits me is: \""What the hell is a 'bialy?'\""  Fortunately, an employee was there to help me understand that a bialy is baked and a bagel is boiled.  So: it's the texture, not the stuffing.  I decide to get one of each toasted with no spreads.  \n\nI think I spent less than $1.50, but I don't remember the exact amount.  Regardless, it was a small price to pay for some delicious culinary research.  In my ever so humble opinion, I like the texture of bagels compared to the bialy.  Taste-wise, they were both much yummier than that nationwide chain you always see on every corner.\n\nI only went here to grab a quick breakfast, but they have different options that I would love to come back for and give another shot."
2,Service was good but food not all that great. It was $17 for two bagel breakfast sandwich's and two coffees.  Everything in the breakfast sandwich tasted pre made for the day and the bagel itself was very very doughy. Always like trying a new place but don't think I will be going back to this.
2,"Make sure they know if u r in a hurry.  Was disappointed bc I called ahead and gave very specific directions (Please make sure the 3 dozen bialy's are in plastic bags bc I need to pack them in my suitcase.  Unfortunately, they were not and I had to make the taxi wait...  costing me more money.  UGH!  In the long run, it ended up costing $72 for 39 bialys (including taxi)"
4,"If you want a perfectly baked bagel, NY Bagels 'n Bialys has the best. They have a large menu to satisfy any breakfast craving and offer fast service. A great breakfast restaurant."
0,"This is short.\n\n8:30 PM, Saturday night, calling Giuseppe....\""ring\""....\""ring\"" \""RESTORANTE GIUSEPPE!\"", \""Hi what's your current wait??\"", \""KITCHEN IN CLOSED\"", 'CLICK'.\n\nYour shitting me right?\n\n8:30 on a Saturday, give me a break. I won't even consider trying it now no matter how good it is, another great example of modern day lazy american business operations."
2,"I found this place by accident as it is tucked into the side of a small strip.  There is another place in the same strip but on the other end called Arivaderci....Don't ever go there....Their food is just bad....I only mention them to ensure there is no going to the wrong place!!\n  When I arrived at Giuseppe, I walked in the door and the inside was full but the outside patio area was completely empty.  As I appraoached the counter, the gentleman just said what can we do for you.....I was a little taken aback as I did not know how to answer that.  I figured usually when you walk into a restaurant, they say how many and seat you.  I literally said that I was there for dinner.  He then said I could sit out the patio if I wanted to.  So that is where I went.  I waited for  a while and a waiter finally appeared and took my drink order. Then came back witha menu.  He brought bread (which was totally dry and the \""herbed\"" butter was no more than butter with some parsley in it) and my drink and was gone again.  When he finally came back, I ordered meat ravioli.  That was brought out by someone else....I never saw my waiter again.  I had to wave through the window to get someone's attention to get my check....OK, the raviloi's were good, but the service sucked.  I guess I had to be one of the \""elite\"" customers inside to get anyone to even bring me another drink...I will probably attempt to go here again (I always like to give places a couple of chances before I totally discard them. )  First impressions are important.   Oh, and btw, the tines on my fork were so bent that I ended up having to press it against the table so I could use the fork....It is definitely \""down home\"" Italian.  One last thing, my name starts and ends with a vowel and has a vowel in the middle.....So I know great Italian....This is not great, but is pretty good. The prices are not all that wonderful either...Small portions for the price.\nOne thing no one mentioned....this is a cash only place, so no credit cards or checks.....Maybe it has something to do with tax collection...HMMMMM?"
4,"This place it the real deal! Pasquale and his family will provide you with amazing hospitality as you eat some of the most authentic Italian food you can get outside of Italy. Meatballs the size of a softball, pasta cooked to a perfect al dente and amazingly fresh ingredients make this place shine. \n\nMy favorites..Peperonata for appetizer and the pasta Alex for a main. They only take cash here, but it is BYOB and no corkage fee which is fantastic. Our server was telling us that his mother made all of the desserts and boy were they delicious. The New York Cheesecake was the table favorite. It was so smooth and creamy and had the perfect moisture and texture. \n\nBring an empty stomach and be ready to have a great time at Ristorante Giuseppe's!"
4,Food was authentic and yummy. It was very inexpensive and you can bring your own wine!! What a concept. No cork fees either.
3,"I was really excited when I heard this was so close to me. I had been to the one on 28th and Indian School before and had no idea this one existed. We were waited on by Giuseppe and it was a very enjoyable experience. I ended up having the manicotti which was very good. I also had the opportunity to try their meatballs (also excellent) and the tiramisu (it, too, was delicious!). The pricing is pretty good, not much more than some big chain restaurants, and you're supporting a locally owned business in the process. Be forewarned (as we did not know this) it is a CASH ONLY establishment! No credit or debit cards accepted. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't been before and wants to try something new, with a good atmosphere, just remember to bring cash!"
3,"This place was really good!\n\nWe chose to go here for a romantic date which was a mistake... not that we didn't have a good time but it was not a romantic setting at all. The name sounded romantic to me. But it was the opposite of romantic. Loud, brightly lit, sassy servers, and children running amok. Reminded me instead of a raucous Italian family reunion. But still a good time!\n\nI love that it's BYOB with no corkage fee. That itself is a great value on it's own. \n\nWe started with the bruschetta. We weren't planning on getting an appetizer but we were talked into it. Yes, the servers are a bit pushy with the upselling. But the bruschetta was tasty and bursting with fresh flavor so we were glad we did.\n\nI had the eggplant rollettini and my husband had the pork Parmesan. The portions weren't as big as they are in other Italian restaurants. I was expecting leftovers to take home. But still very filling. My eggplant was very tasty but a bit salty. My husband and I both loved the marinara. It was very unique. I detected a warm seasoning to it... cinnamon or nutmeg? I don't know but it was good. My husband thought his pork was delicious. He said it lacked breading but was still excellent.\n\nWe will definitely return but we learned our lesson. Expect a casual and energetic good time with delicious food. We see this being a great spot for a double date... each couple bringing a great bottle of wine."
1,"I take my car here every 3,000 miles for oil changes only. These guys will try to sell you everything you don't need for your car so be careful! I just print out my discount coupon, get my oil change and say thanks but no thanks to their list of suggestions i need to do to make my car safe. They will try to sell you things like fuel injection cleaner for $100($10 at O'Reilly), tell you your brake fluid is dirty by showing you a strip, same goes for power steering, and rear differential(DON'T DO IT! Total Scam.) If your car has under 150k miles, you have nothing to worry about. Those parts are sealed.If they tell you need a air filter or cabin filter, save the money and go down the street to O'Reilly (and no I don't work for O'Relly)"
4,"I am still coming to the same Firestone years later and the same guys still work there and they are still good to me. The make sure I don't pay for services I don't need and when I do need something, they make sure it is taken care of asap and try to make sure it doesn't cost a small fortune. Even my coworkers in my office have started going to this location and they guys are good to them. Plus they know if they aren't I would give them hell, and the last thing they want is a mad Ebony on their hands lol. I trust them as they know my car is important to me. So in a nutshell, yes I still like this Firestone. The end! :)"
3,"Great selection and wonderful staff.  They're always happy to go way beyond the call-of-duty to look for something you are requesting, and if possible, special order it and stock it for you - fantastic.  Four stars because I still have to shop elsewhere for fresh food and some strange herbs / extracts.  Would put 4.5 if I could :)."
0,"Stopped in to buy a new cable with a friend. While I was picking out my cable, my friend asked to play a guitar. The guitars are placed behind the amps so that you can't touch them, which would be ok if they were super nice and expensive. However, the selection was junk and every guitar I heard was set up terribly. On top of it, Monty was incredibly rude because my friend wasn't going to buy the guitar. He was so busy being a jackass to my friend that he couldn't even hear me asking him to grab a guitar chord for me off of a shelf behind his counter. I don't know if it's because he was having a conversation with a friend when we walked in, but I have just never been treated so rudely through a shopping experience. I will never go back and I hope you will avoid this place as well as it does not deserve you business."
1,"Oh the smell of Olive Garden.  Isn't that the most recognizable smell? I swear I think they pipe it into the vents.\n\nWhen I worked at PV mall I felt positively fancy to eat salad and bread sticks for lunch here.  And at $3.95 it was quite the bargain when it wasn't an official lunch menu item.  Now they've made it $5.95 for soup and salad w/ breadsticks which still isn't a bad deal.  But now of course it doesn't taste quite as good as when I thought it was healthy.\n\nAs for the other food, I was turned off when I had 2 different friends work there who specifically told me not to go there.  Well, not that it was bad or I'd get sick, but that it was to Italian food what Taco Bell was to Mexican food.  When they said that if I could microwave, I could cook at Olive Garden, I decided to trust them.  I'll admit I've been a few times with them when I'm with other folks who really really wanted to go.  The last time I went was maybe 9 months ago and what really struck me were the prices.  I can get fresh ingredients and real cooking for that price - and generally better service.  \n\nThe best thing I can say about this place is how many jobs it's given my friends over the years because they have such an amazing turn over they will hire just about anyone.  This is a great place to get a job to get server experience.  And once you've learned the art of hospitaliano, you can go get a better job.  Just like everyone else.  But it will still take at least 3 months for the smell of Olive Garden to get out of your clothes and your car."
0,I scheduled an appointment with the Dr. He never came in. The PA came in for 5 minutes. He barely did a physical exam. Never even tested for reflexes! Complained to the office manager. Had to track her down and keep calling to reach her. Horrible practicioners and patient service. I found another Dr. Complete different attitude. She did a complete physical exam and spent time with me. Never go to AZ Center for Pain!!!
0,"I have eaten at this Red Lobster for years. Recently things have slipped. Yesterday a group of us had dinner. One person ordered the fish and chips. What came was batter, no fish. Two us is had Cobb salads, poor...the lettuce was frozen in both salads. Needless to say this place needs a major over haul. The only good thing about this restaurant is the server Mary who is stellar. Too may other places to eat."
2,"I don't understand why the ratings are so low at this Red Lobster.   Had the shrimp and the rock fish.  Both were prepared well.  The piece of rock fish was much too small for my husband. That needs to be worked on.  I noticed that the baked potato got smaller.  That's OK--maybe my waistline will too.   The garden salad was mostly iceberg lettuce with chopped tomatoes, chopped cucumber and one red onion ring.  I would have added two black olives and a few garbanzos to make it look like real salad---variety.  But I don't think that it is Red Lobster's formula.  Chain restaurants follow a formula and recipe on everything for consistency.  But I suggest they rework their salads to include some rocket greens along with iceberg.  The shrimp were fried perfectly and not greasy.  I noticed they don't offer an extra round of their DELICIOUS biscuits---my waistline appreciates it.  The cocktail I ordered was more a blend of juices than any alcohol.  Before ordering it I asked whether it would have enough alcohol and Pattie said yes.  Well it didn't and that's why I taking off a star.  A cocktail should make the drinker feel good and enjoy it.  I basically ordered a glass of mixed juices.\nI liked our waitress (PATTIE)  she was very helpful with my husband's order....OOPS, did I forget to say that they were out of Cod?   My husband went there specifically for the cod since he does not eat shellfish and the last time he didn't like the flounder.  So he ended up having to settle.   So I am taking off one star for no COD and for the alcohol-less cocktail.  Otherwise the food is OK.  \nThanks, Pattie.  You were really helpful!"
1,"This store always looks like a bomb went off. Every time I visit this location it is unorganized, messy, and it smells weird. The messiness makes it very difficult to find things, which can be really frustrating."
3,Beautiful campus!! First time attending and have the pleasure of having two exemplary  professors.  This school has a great culinary arts programs as well as an awesome hospitality program!!\n\nLove it!
1,"Ok, lets be honest. Casinos are places of desperation, seedy experiences, lost dreams, and just downright hilarity. I love casinos. I am in no way a compulsive gambler, addict, or junky of any sort so I feel my reviews of casinos can be quite frank and honest from an outsiders perspective.\n\nThis place sucks!!!\n\nIt is filled with people hooked up to respirators with their filthy wigs and blue hairs. There is nothing \""bling\"" about this place and its genuinely old, dirty, and depressing. \n\nThe slot machines are a haven for old timers to pump away their social security checks and their grandchildrens inheritance. The machines don't pay out and when you win more than 200 bucks it has to be hand delivered to you. \n\nIndians casinos always suck  - this place is no exception."
1,"Monday night all you can eat crab night wasn't all it was cracked up to be...haha! The crab was over done and rubbery. They serve it to you instead of you pickin out all the best legs. We went around nine and there was only one other guy there... which was the only good thing. I give the buffet a D for food and B for service, we had 3 waitresses dying of boredom and constantly bringing clean plates and fresh drinks. \n\nIf you would like to try for yourself, maybe you'll have better luck ;)\nEagles Nest Buffet @Mckellips location Sunday and Monday $14.00 All-u-can-eat-crab 4:30-10pm"

3,"Best poker room in town, and I have tried several of them.  The entire area is non-smoking which helps.  The room has a good mix of games, and tons of tables.  My only complaint is that I live on the west side, so it's a long drive to get to this location."

0,"My son, one of his friends and I went to L8 Night Bingo tonite. I have played Bingo at CA many times and never paid much attention to details. We all paid for the same package. At one point we noticed that I had twice as many cards as my son, then noticed his friend had 3 times as many cards on each game. When my son questioned them about it they called security and took him to some office. Then they threatened him with the police and accused him of things he did not do. Watch out for these people. If you catch them cheating you may find yourself being detained."
0,"I can't even give it one star because the people that take your money are mean. Yes I agreed that I'm not a pro gambler, but I'm not a sore loser either. I spent lots gambling and had a bad experience with Jennifer and grandma. The more you spend the worst the casino treats you. I would recommend the bar because prie treats you awesome and her staff."
0,"I had a lower blepharoplasty (eye lift) by Dr. Nachbar in September 2003. This procedure left me needing reconstructive surgery costing additional thousands of dollars. My eyes will always have Dr. Nachbar's mark on them. Some of the damage is not fixable.\n\nThe results of my surgery left both eyes with incisions that were placed  low and not in a natural laugh line. To make things worse, the left eye incision curved down from the corner of the eye, extended out to about 3/4 of an inch and ended with a divit. This divit was created when the stitches were painfully pulled out. The incision scarring healed horribly and widened out leaving me with an indentation and redness to this day. The left eye was also left with a pucker from improper draping of the skin. A  piece of fat was left behind under the right eye which gave me the appearance of a big bump under that eye. Both eyes were hollowed out and rounded out leaving me with a completely different eye shape. My eyes had continual pressure, pain, irritation, and itching for 3 years after the procedure.\n\nI communicated my concerns to a Sharon Brown on staff by e-mail and phone. She was completely unhelpful. I requested my money back and never received it.\n\nI am not a person who easily dispenses bad reviews. If I could give zero stars I would. I truly regret every day that I chose Dr. Nachbar as my surgeon. I hope this review helps you in your choice."
1,"I am searching for a good doctor here in Scottsdale and found this practice on Cigna.com.  I called to see if Dr. Magda Williams was accepting new patients.  She was indeed.\n\nI asked the receptionist what the next step was since I was a new patient.  She let me know that I'd have to have an initial appointment to establish care, deeming the doctor my primary care physician.  \n\nCould I meet the doctor before signing the agreement?  She had to ask someone and then let me know that I could meet with Dr. Soni (a male doctor) during this initial appointment, but Dr. Williams could give me a physical after I establish care.  \n\nWhy would I want to meet with some other doctor to establish care with Dr. Williams?  I asked her if Dr. Williams had any open appointments the next day; Dr. Soni did at 2:15.  I let her know I'd think about it; I didn't feel comfortable with this arrangement.  \n\nI received a call today from Scottsdale Family & Urgent Care informing me that I had missed an appointment at 2:15.  Did I want to reschedule?\n\nI called back and told the receptionist about the initial call.  There is clearly a lack of communication at this office.  I don't think I'll be going to this Family Practice.  \n\nTwo stars for persistance.  I really wish I could write a better review about the actual DOCTORS at the practice--not a critique of the protocol and competence of the receptionists--but I guess that's why they call them \""gate keepers\""."
4,"Best of the best.  This is THE sushi place in all of Scottsdale and the surrounding cities in the Phoenix area.  Having lived in Japan, I have tasted the real good sushi and other traditional Japanese dishes like udon, tonkatsu.   The fish is always fresh, some flown in from Japan. On a regular night, Hiro and his sons are behind the counter, making sushi for the customers.  During the cooler months, I like to order the nabeyaki udon and some rolls like toro, caterpillar, rainbow, spicy tuna etc.  The nigiri and sashimi are amazing.  Sometimes, I like to order the bento selection with tempura and tonkatsu as my favorite choices.  The tempura here is just the way it should be, light and crunchy.  Seriously, Hiro Sushi is an oasis in the desert state of Arizona, can't get any better... Totemo oichi desu...  (very delicious)"
2,"This place is not the cheapest nor the best.\nBut this place does have the most decent food.\nThe tempura is good.\nSushi is fresh. And the portion is pretty generous.\nThe staff very friendly.\nBut why I gave them 3. Because their presentation sucks. The sushi roll doesn't stay put. I mean, it literally break apart when you try to pick em up.\nI still keep coming here, because I haven't found other place yet. the only bad part of travelling to a different place, is .. hard to find a good sushi place. and I'm still looking."
4,"Best sushi I've ever had!\n\nIt's so fresh, it's so melt-in-your mouth delicious, it's pretty much the best sushi I've had the pleasure of trying.\n\nOur party ordered lots of salmon, lots of tuna, and my all time favorite, lots of yellowtail.  We also had a variety of rolls too.  Everything, from the appetizer to the sushi was omnomnom.\n\nThe seaweed salad was perfectly seasoned, probably the best I've had.  The fish was generously and perfectly cut.  I'm usually not a fan of tuna, but the tuna was so delicious, I ate lots of it.  Obviously I stuffed myself with salmon and yellowtail nigiri.\n\nI'm pretty sure I gained 20lbs after gobbling up everything."
2,"Once again, I was craving sushi.\n\nI read your reviews, and decided to take the small leap (if there is such a thing) into Hiro Sushi. \n\nWe ordered the Rainbow roll, Crazy Roll and Crunchy California Roll.\n\nAll were pretty good. Not great (sorry) but good. \n\nThe people that work there are darling, nice and attentive. \n\nMaybe I\""ve had too much sushi all over the planet,or am too picky (or spoiled with killer sushi?) but this was good,  not great. \n\nScottsdale peeps, try Dozo...it looks like an old Jack In the Crack from the outside, but inside? Pretty. Most importantly, they have awesome sushi.\n\nAnyone in the Chandler/Awautukee area? Try Sushi Eye (on Warner)..."
1,"We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\n\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade."
3,"I moved from Los Gatos, CA to Scottsdale in July 2011 and when I interviewed for the job I knew I had to find at least one decent sushi restaurant before I could accept the offer...maybe a slight exaggeration, but it was top on my list!\n\nI found Hiro Sushi on Yelp and made a late night run for dinner.  The restaurant is cozy and tucked into a strip mall, so I wasn't sure what I was going to get.  When I went inside, there was a line, which I took as a good sign...and waited for my table.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of sushi.  Each roll I ate was tasty and service was very good. \n\nI was pleased to find a great, little sushi spot and have eaten there many times in the last year...their takeout service is quick and easy too!\n\nI may be moving back to CA but if and when I'm in Scottsdale again, I will certainly pay a visit to Hiro Sushi!"
4,"Oh how I wish I lived in Phoenix, so I could become a regular here. For those of you who are also on the quest to find authentic Japanese restaurants in the US, go to Hiro's if you find yourself in the area.  From the initial, \""Irrashai!\"" As we walked in, the experience was like being in a little sushi joint in Japan.  My companion noted several times how great the service was and I have to agree.  I was excited to see Okinawa Soba on the menu so gave that a shot along with Otoro, salmon, Hamachi and Kani.   Ok, so the Toro did not need to be chewed it merely melted...heaven.  The last time I had Okinawa Soba was in Japan and this was the real deal even to include the hot pepper infused Awamori (ok, it was actually Vodka, but tasted the same). Our waitress had just moved here from Okinawa three years ago. \n\nWe had a Japanese rice beer... An import that was very good. \n\nSooo, this was overall an excellent experience and I'm glad we found it"
1,"I'm on a hunt for a new sushi place, so I drove 40 minutes to go check this place out.  My review is strictly on their food.   I drove that far, because I trusted Yelp reviews on this place.  What a disappointment it turned out to be...\n\nYes, they have the abalone,  and otoro which I can't find in many other places in AZ...but that's about it.  Their cut on sashimi is poor, meaning, the sashimi chef's skill is not up to par.  The fish is cut too thin, and is jagged at the edges.  Everything is over priced for what it is.  I've had much better other places such as Gilbert of all places!  \n\nI'm all for paying top dollar if what you serve me is top notch!  But this place just isn't worth it!"
4,"LOVE this place. Hands down some of the best sushi I've ever had - everything is fresh and thoughtfully made. The sushi is great (the scallops are amazing), they have some unique rolls on the menu and the service is outstanding. It's a very small place which I love and I think it adds to the authenticity. The chefs greet and say thank you to all who enter and leave. Can't say enough good things about this place!"
2,"A bit of an older b&n but it has all the essentials.  Good, clean store and friendly employees make the experience even better."
3,"Went here once for labwork.  My wife had something down the street to tend to.  No one was there, and it was only me that Friday morning.  I was in and out in 7 minutes.  Too bad this place is now closed :-(!!!"
4,"If you are looking for a Thai place in the Phoenix metro area, you've found it. When I first moved to Phoenix, I discovered the Swaddee Thai location in Chandler. A few years later, I moved to N Phoenix, and I was thankful to find that there was another Swaddee Thai close to me!\n\nMy favorite things on the menu are tofu coconut princess and Tom Ka, a coconut milk / mushroom soup. I love the amount of vegetarian options; you even get a choice of soft or fried tofu!\n\nThe service here is fast, the food is fantastic, and this is a great place to seek out for a delicious lunch or dinner."
4,"Similar to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, but a lot more \""gourmet\"" and even more helpful sales staff.  Wine selection is amazing with a staffed sommelier.  I used to live across the street from the Thompson Peak location, and loved the weeknight specials like stir-fry prepared in front of you.  It reminds me of similar dorm cafeteria specials...only good, and a helluva lot more expensive!"
1,They finally closed. I believe this was the first A.J.'s in Arizona......and the past few years it slowly went downhill.
3,"The wings here are excellent.  The \""suicide\"" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good."
1,"Uncle Sam's is a local institution, so I'll always be loyal.  I try to make it to the original Shea/32nd St. store whenever possible, though.  The Scottsdale store often makes me feel taken advantage of.  \n\nSee, the thing about Uncle Sam's is that it started out as a kind-of hangout for high schoolers.  Which explains the haphazard atmosphere, service and menu.  But the food was great and service was efficient and friendly; so the kids just kept coming over the years and now have gotten their kids and grandkids on board.  All the good stuff is pretty much still there at the original location.  \n\nThe casual attitude often turns into neglect at the Scottsdale store, though.  Resulting in sloooooow service, no refills and food that's cold by the time it gets to you.  So unless I'm right nearby, I usually steer toward the 32nd St. location when that cheese steak craving hits."
0,"I think I actually 'hate' this place. Strong words. It started many many years ago when my dad had me pick up an order here for carry-out. They forgot to make half the order and when I came back to get it - they didn't apologize for over-charging me, about forgetting the order or seem to notice I drove back to get it. I sat waiting for the order for. ever. \n\nForgetting to include food in a take-out order happens, it's a simple mistake, I get it. But they didn't respond appropriately, in any way at all, just kind of stood there like \""soooo does this mean you want us to make it now...err...maybe?...well....hmmm..\"" My dad actually called the manager when I got back - the second time - and he didn't offer an apology or remedy the situation. \n\nThe food is just awful. I save the word \""mediocre\"" for frozen wings, pizza & subs from the freezer section - Uncle Sam's is not worthy, it's gross. \n\nIf my review isn't enough to warn you to dine elsewhere, maybe the state's health inspection review is - \n\nHow bad is a restaurant that actually needs the government to tell them to get rid of roaches? \n\nhttp://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-05575&business=Uncle%20Sam%27s%20Restaurant&address=10520%20N%2090th%20St\n\n\""OBSERVED TWO LIVE ROACHES PRESENT UNDER EQUIPMENT IN BAR. HAVE LICENSED PEST CONTROL PERFORMED UNTIL PESTS ARE ELIMINATED.\"""
0,"I guess I'm one of those that is totally disgusted as well. Have had a hard time finding a rheumatologist and definitely won't go back here again..\nDr. Rizzo and his staff are less than ideal. He actually told me people \""my age\"" don't have Rheumatoid Arthritis and any positive I must have gotten on a test was incorrect. He told me to use \""mind over matter\"" to manage my pain, be the lightest weight possible for my body type and take two tylenol as needed. He did not do a proper exam of me to begin with, and already had me in tears. It is frustrating to take off work, wait a month for an appt, be snubbed by the receptionist and then be asked \""why are you here?!?!\"" from the doctor who you can clearly tell is not taking you seriously.\nFind someone else, anyone else. I advise against trusting Dr. Rizzo with your rheumatoid arthritis.\nWish I would have noticed the other reviews about him on www.ratemds.com before making an appointment with him, and I hope to save you the same experience!"
3,"Great spot to just hang with the crew. Not the normal uppity Scottsdale bar. Games are upstairs and lots of room. Food was okay. I got the nachos and the chips were very stale but my friend got the burger and it looked really good. Good atmosphere. It's or after work hangout, if we can get everyone together more often.  :)"
0,The doctors all treated me like a total whiner when I was pregnant and neglected to properly diagnose me with some severe and debilitating health conditions that developed during my pregnancy. Keep in mind all they care about is the baby and the mom's complaints just get brushed to the wayside. They spend about five minutes with you and no more. I could not be more disappointed and had a completely  miserable pregnancy AND delivery AND hospital stay thanks to their total and complete negligence and failure to properly diagnose or even recommend I see a specialist. I asked for someone to evaluate my problems when I was in the hospital and they said it was not possible for that to happen....wtf??? I was just told it is normal to feel awful when pregnant. Everyone feels awful just shut up and deal with it. Had someone taken the time to actually take my compaints seriously and order a few simple tests I could have been spared a year of complete misery and suffering.
4,had a pedi and gel mani done today! absolutely will be coming back :) everyone was so nice and the prices are perfect. \nvery very clean as well!
4,"They did a great job. They got us right in, they have massage chairs, they were very good.  They gave us bottled water. My daughter got a flower on each of her big toes and there was no extra charge even with a jewel on it."
4,This is the best Chipotle in town!! They give the most. If you want Extra chicken they give you EXTRA!! I don't mind paying extra for double meat but some of the Chipotles are so skimpy! They also have the nicest staff Not kidding!!
0,I have a food allergy and they had no idea how to prepare my food safely. The worst chipotle I've been to in any state.
3,"Just a quick review of Macaroni Grill. \n\nI've been to this location several times and I've never been disappointed. The service is always pleasant and fast and the food is pretty darn good for a chain. \n\nI've tried some of their pasta dishes and had the grilled pork chops once and they were quite good. I ordered them on a whim and was pleasantly surprised with them. And they make a great Insalata Blu which is bibb lettuce, walnuts, red onions, grated bleu cheese all tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nThe bread they serve with the olive oil and cracked black pepper is always pleasing. And they have a great blackberry mint iced tea. Yum. \n\nThe music they play is a great mix of Italian opera and the Italian crooners of the 50's such as Frank Sinatra. And hopefully there will be a birthday or two while you're there. They usually have a singer who does a great job of \""Happy Birthday\"" in Italian. (What does this person do besides sing? Is that all they do? Anyone know?) \n\nOh, and if you use the restroom they play lessons in Italian while you are....um...doing your business. Pretty cool.( I just hope that if I ever need to use Italian in an emergency I don't have to duck into a bathroom to remember it.) \n\nIf you're in the mood for some good Italian food with good portions and friendly attentive service, Macaroni Grill can't be beat in my book."
1,"After a much glorified recommendation from the waiter too get the pork c hop special, result was 4 dried out chops, 4 undercooked risottos ( which they replaced with something else, ours were the last they had for the night). After mention of the chops drones, we're told they would melt in mouth, that was not going to happen with those chopsn we were offered free dessert. Took it home, tiramisu, will taste in the AM for breakfast. Disappointing as previous visit was actually quite good. Fifth person had the meatballs, said they were good.\n\nAppetizers muscles were good as was the soup."
0,"Oh my gosh, what a disaster!  My husband called in an order and asked me to pick it up on my way home.  I arrived and went to the pick-up area where there were 3 other people in front of me.  No big deal, right?  Well, after about 30 minutes, the woman in line just ahead of me was told that they did not have her order that was phoned in about an hour earlier.  So, she placed another order and sat down to wait.  \n\nFinally, after about 45 minutes in line, I make it to the cashier, and after giving him my name and what was ordered, he proceeds to tell me that they do not have the order!  Thinking that my name could have been mis-spelled or taken down incorrectly, I asked him if there was an identical order under a similar name.  Instead of checking, the employee looks at me and asks, \""Are you asking me to give you someone else's food?\""  Unbelievable!  Then he asks me if I want to place an order to go!  After witnessing what was happening in the kitchen during my 45 minute wait, I'm sure that I would have had another hour or more to wait for my order to be completed!  The kitchen that was utterly chaotic.  Absolutely no organization by the chef (who was shouting out orders to anyone who would listen, but no one in particular)!  The kitchen was piled high with dirty pans everywhere.  It's a wonder they got any orders out.  \n\nHad the cashier not accused me of asking him to give me another person's food, I may have considered returning to this restaurant.  However, after that treatment, and what I witnessed in the kitchen, I can say with confidence that I will NEVER set foot in this place again!"
0,"Horrible atmosphere, waiters left dirty dishes on one of the three islands/pantry in the middle of the restaurant. (Which is weird enough....that you can see opened very cans of soda and cut up lime and lemons that have been sitting out for who knows how long). Horrible service. Horrible attitude waiters. Would never go back. I am surprised that this chain has not been shut down."
0,Chicken milanese(used to be our favorite) was DRY and only cooked on ONE side...brocolini was hard as a rock. We never saw a manager the entire time we were there and the server couldn't have cared less when we pointed out the food wasn't up to par. I emailed them and of course they never bothered to respond.\n\nIf you want  a fabulous dinner...you might want to go elsewhere
1,Terrible Service... It took a few minutes just to be greeted by the Host.\nFood was ok...
0,Horrible service and gave our food to another table
2,"\""It's a chain. It's fondue. BUT perfect for the right occasion. I would give it 4 stars for groups or first dates. You get to cook your food so it is interactive giving you something other than your nerves to focus on. Pretty pricey however.\"""
3,"If you go here, you will enjoy a four course fondue meal. The desert chocolate is awesome. I prefer the 'Smores' option but the others look great also. They have many options for the main course. This place is pricey and you do have to cook your own food, but a nice option for special occasions."
2,"A very unique place specializing fondues.. This is my first try, everything went like I expected, but not outreaching... We had the Fusion version of the Big Night Out  four-course meal.. A lot of food for two, and not cheap!\n\n1st course - Fondue A La France\nIt was a-ok.. the cheese mix was great, but the white wine (don't remember name) base was too strong... I wish they'd use less of the alcohol. But you get unlimited sides with it..\n\n2nd course - Salad Nicoise and California Salad\nBoth salads were tasty! However, the plates arrived in an ice-cold condition, and by looking at the presentation of the salad, I felt it was already pre-made and came out from the refrigerator.. the leaves just don't look like were just mixed together...\n\n3rd course - Main entree with Court Bouillon cooking style\nThe fusion version offers one extra item, a lobster tail, other than that, everything is the same from the feast version. Meat and seafood were fresh, wish that I had chosen a different cooking style, maybe the Bourguignonne, didn't really enjoy the vegetable broth, personally think the taste was too strong..\n\n4th course - White & Dark Chocolate Fondue\nThis was my fav!!! The mixture of two kinds of chocolate was just right, adding the different toppings for dipping, cheesecake, strawberries, bananas...hmmmm... If only it has less calories, I'll never have enough!\n\nThe whole dinner took about 2 hours as we're fast-eater and didn't really spend that much time on the cheese fondue...so come prepare for a long stay if you want to experience the 'whole package'.."
1,"I saw a someone praise this place on Facebook and I started chuckling. My wife asked me to go with her to the melting pot a couple years ago. She was very excited until the food actually came. That's when she said, this isn't what we ordered. I said yeah there is less then 4 oz of meat to share between 2 people. She said, no I meant these are the wrong sauces. I said hang on. We are paying 120 dollars for 2 cups of raw vegetables, 4 oz of meat, and beef stock? She said well your paying for the ambiance. Plus desert is to die for. Desert came, she said Isn't this great and I said we are dipping less then a cup of fruit in chocolate. At the end she said you hated it, didn't you. I said baby I loved being there with you, but I have never paid so much money in all my life to eat every day food and stay hungry. For the same money we could have gone to any number of nice restaurants and actually had a full meal.  My wife laughed and then said yeah your right. It's a great little niche restaurant idea, but once you get past all the hoopla this is place is a huge rip off.  On the plus side, It's a nice romantic place with super dark tables. Cooking your own food gives you plenty of time to sit and talk with that special someone."
3,"This is a great spot for a date night.\n\nWe had a table right next to the fireplace.  \nOur server was slow at first, but very kind and a lot of fun.\n\nThe food was delicious.  We had a cheese fondue, salads, and an endless meat fondue.  Keep in mind this isn't your typical restaurant.  You don't go and get served ready-to-eat food.  You get served food that you cook in the fondue pot.  If you're OK with that, this is a lot of fun.  It can get a bit overwhelming keeping track of cooking times, but it's worth it.\n\nWe regret not getting a chocolate fondue for dessert, but we were way too full."
3,"Pretty delicious! The melting pot is always one of my favorites. The service is always great (Ashley didn't disappoint during our visit yesterday). The food is consistently delicious. The quality is good but it's up to you to prepare it correctly. My one complaint and the reason I gave 4 vs 5 stars, I was charged $39.95 for the endless fondue but the website and the manager informed me that it'd be $36.95. It's only a $3 difference but, hey, that $3 could have covered my coffee."
4,"After two extremely disappointing trips to the Melting Pot in Ahwatukee, I was hesitant to try the Scottsdale location. I had some dip certificates that were about to expire, so I decided to give them another try. \n\nI am so glad that I did. Not only was the food amazing, but the service was excellent. Michael D. was the server, and he was friendly and professional. There were two managers walking around to make sure that everyone in the restaurant was satisfied, and I was very happy to honestly say that it was the best experience I've ever had at The Melting Pot in a long time. From now on, I'll only come to this location. If Michael is still there the next time I visit, I will definitely be asking for his section again."
1,"Do you know how in high school, if you don't have the money (or are too cheap to spend it) for a fancy prom date?  Well, if you know, then you know you choose a fake fancy restaurant, that let's folks wear jeans, charges too much, and gives too little.  You know?  Well, that's The Melting Pot.\n\nWe were fortunate to buy a Groupon on sale, but that's not to say we felt those precious dollars were spent well.  The discount still left us feeling like we over paid.  While the food was good, the prices are ridiculously inflated.  Had I paid full price for the vegetarian entree I ordered, it would have been $25 for 4 halves of artichoke heart, 4 tofu wedges, 4 slices of mushroom, 4 asparagus stalks and 4 raviolis.  $25 is half my weekly budget in groceries.  Sorry, this ain't no prom date.\n\nThe lighting is very low and the atmosphere feels posh, kind of sleek.  So, again, some fancy feeling for you.  Apparently reservations are highly suggested (why people line up, I just don't know).  We sat at the bar, albeit comfortably.\n\nStill, our server was pleasant and helpful.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  An attempt here and there to up sale, a smile, a description of what's in our \""melting pot.\""\n\nOverall, if you want to stab your food, feel fancy, and eat very little, this is the place for you.  I really don't know why anyone would spend the money it costs to eat here, when there are other options, but, if you like pretense of a prom date, this is a right fit for you."
4,"Went here the other night for a client holiday party.  There was about 10 of us at the table.  The restaurant is nice, clean and comfortable.  Diners were wearing business casual.  Appeared to be a nice place to take a date or go out for a business lunch or dinner.  I was a little taken back by the paper covers on the tablecloths, but again, Italian food is messy.\n\nThe server was very knowledgeable about the menu, pasta and wine, and made some excellent recommendations.  I was appreciative of her knowledge. \n\nI ordered eggplant parmesan.  Other guests ordered scampi, fresh fish, and pork medallions.  Every dish came out beautifully prepared, very large portions, everything was fresh.  Everyone raved about their food.\n\nThe eggplant parmesan was covered in cheese and fresh, home-made marinara sauce.  It was delicious and I wanted to eat every bite, but it was so huge!.  This dish could easily have fed four people!\n\nI was too full to eat another bite by the time dessert came around, but the 10 of us shared a tiramisu.  It was creamy and flavorful, more like a pudding than a cake.  \n\nGreat place!  We will be back!"
1,"Samurai Sam's tries hard at creating some Asian inspired food\n\nThe three of us came here last week, each ordering something different. I had three chicken tacos which were good, but had virtually no meat. As you can see from the photos, it's hard to find any. Lots of veggies though.\n\nAs for my friends, they each ordered different types of teriyaki bowls. Both came with a lot of rice, but again not much else.\n\nSadly, you can get  nearly twice as much food at Panda Express.  It's hard to justify coming back, our bill came to $24.70, including two soft drinks and one water. So, Two Stars and yes, we have had better.\n\nSorry!"
0,"I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings."
4,"Love this place.  Only ever eaten breakfast here, but the atmosphere is great -- the owners are very nice and the staff is efficient but caring.  The food is GREAT.  The breakfast items are REALLY fresh and makes me think they get them locally.  I saw a lot of \""organic\"" on the menu, so I know the actual ingredients are very good.\n\nHighly recommend this place!!"
3,"We couldn't decide on what to eat last night so we pulled into the AJs parking lot. We saw the sports bar but decided to take a chance on the Dragonfly Cafe. Right away we noticed the ambience the music and the nice relaxing atmosphere. Could've gone without the \""Magician\"" I felt like coming down with a case of Tourette's syndrome!!  the Cosmo was interesting, weird glass! The food was awesome, shrimp boat was quite interesting, the scallops was to die for!! Desert was quite interesting. Apple Crumb pie with Ice cream, Too much to finish. DragonFly Cafe didn't BUG us at all!"
2,"I tend to always prefer privately owned small restaurants. Everything about this place says that I would like this one too. The food choices are unique and flavorful and the staff friendly and accommodating. However we dined on a Saturday night and there was live music. We were a large party and I couldn't hear the person next to me speaking. Nothing else about this visit was negative, just that the music was too loud, and that drew my attention away from what normally would have been a very positive experience.   I will go back, just not when they are having live music. (Unless they drop the decibels a few notches).\n\nBoth the appetizer Mediterranean Seared Lamb ,and the entree; Cedar River Farms Hanger Steak were excellent, even the  zucchini pancakes which were part of the appetizer tasted great (although they were just a little limp and oily). \n\nI must admit, I was suffering from plate envy through most of my meal. I dined in a large party so I got to see and sample many of the dishes. I would recommend the Hard Apple Cider Pot Roast and the Savory Baked Macaroni and Cheese (which is much more than you think! You'll have to go to find out)"
0,"Great produce, good small appliance selection and terrible customer service.   We used to shop here weekly, but have stopped in the last couple of years because of the uniformly unfriendly folks at checkout.   Unfortunately, the final impression is always the most lasting.  While the employees in produce, meats and other departments are all really great, the checkers here make shopping a very unpleasant experience"
3,Great sandwiches.  My kids love the pizza and soda fountain with the numerous options.
3,"it is beautiful in here. nothing like our local fry's. very large, spacious, and looks like a high end supermarket. \n\nvery warm, and cozy if that can be used to describe a supermarket. they entry is always packed with a beautiful setting of plants and seasonal items. their alcohol department is enormous!\n\ni come here for a quick pick up after work if we need a milk or bananas. if i'm lucky, they're handing out sushi and i usually eat 4 or 5 because i'm starving all the time. \n\nvery pretty store."
2,"Had a quick lunch here as I often do after a Home Depot run or when I'm craving chips and salsa.  I have to agree with everyone else's review as far as the price goes; I know it's located in Scottsdale but $4+ for a single taco (and it's funny because that specifically caught my eye when I went yesterday) is stupid, I don't care how much garnish you put on the plate.  I do love when they have their \""margarita sales\"" though!  \n\nI go here for a few reasons:  it's close.  The salsa is good.  The service is good.  I think the same servers have been there for years and although they never seem to acknowledge that I'm back again (hey, I'm a regular, give me some love please!) they still treat me well.  They're not stingy on the chips and salsa (can you tell this is a major prerequisite for me in judging a Mexican food place?) and the food is decent.  So, I give it an \""A-OK\"" as the local Mexican place. Also never crazy busy so there's no wait, and the food is never too spicy so rookie out-of-towners can enjoy their meal too.\n\nIf the management is reading this:  your food is pretty good and your waitstaff is very nice, but in general, you're nothing too out of the ordinary and you're scaring away clients with your Scottsdale prices. Take it down a notch and you'll get more neighborhood support. There's WAY too many Mexican places nearby to choose from so do something to make us want to come around more often."
2,"2.5 stars, but I'll round it up for our first visit.\n\nMom's choice after seeing it featured on Check, Please! Arizona.  We were looking forward to trying the Tres Amigos, for it looked so good on TV.  I thought I heard one of the guests say it was made with flour tortillas, and since I'm allergic to corn, I was happy to hear this.  I didn't even bother to confirm with the server, since I'm tired of asking so many questions.  Well, at least two of the enchiladas were made with corn, so I left that entree for Mom to enjoy.  She favored the chicken tomatillo most.  It was also the only one she found cooked perfectly.  The other two (spinach and shredded beef) had tortillas that were partially-cooked.  We both tried the side of refried beans and liked it.  She thought the rice was terrible and didn't even bother to include it in the leftovers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQ#Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQ\n\nI ordered a spinach enchilada in a flour tortilla a la carte. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw#aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw  I enjoyed it, even though it's just a tortilla filled with saut\u00e9ed spinach and onions, with chopped lettuce and tomatoes on the side.  Would I order it again?  Probably not.  We may return for Mom to try a seafood entree, and I will have to try the beef and chicken enchiladas, but not anytime soon.\n\nThe flan was good.  Not the best, as Mom makes the best flan, but we both appreciated this flan's texture.  I actually prefer its flavors the day after. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA#LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA"
1,"This place is worthless if you need immediate care during the day!!! My kitty has chronic UTIs that can lead to severe and life threatening blockages. On several occasions they have done little or nothing to accommodate him during such instances....stating that they are booked and that I should visit an emergency vet. Well then why am I paying you monthly if you can never see my pet when he needs to be seen? I was told \""you do know this is a wellness clinic?\"" So, apparently sick pets are not a priority for them. The Desert Ridge location is FAR better about getting him in...even when they are full, they squeeze him in between patients. It is a shame, because I really like Dr. Cherico. Furthermore, the techs are not very skilled in handling feisty pets. My other cat does not like coming to the vet, at all, and often becomes very agitated. One instance the techs left me in the room for 20 minutes to try and get my hissing, spitting, and scratching cat in her crate by myself. During a subsequent teeth cleaning she was allowed to scratch herself in her own eye leading to an eye infection that became an ear infection as well. It was awful. I do not recommend the 90th location at all!!!"
0,"Earlier this year, I received a beautiful diamond and ruby bee brooch for my birthday. It is a vintage family piece so it has a lot of sentimental value for me. When studying it, I thought I had felt a few loose diamonds. I decided to take it into Scottsdale Fine Jewelers for repair. I met the owner Scott and informed him that I believed there were some loose diamonds and that I wanted the prongs checked and tighten, if need be. I had every intention of leaving it there for repair. He took the bee into the backroom and then came back out with it surprisingly much faster than I anticipated stating that it was fixed and that there was no charge. Of course I was thrilled that there was not a charge and that I could start wearing it, but I was also very skeptical about the amount of time it took him to check all the prongs. Due to that, I did not wear it that often. \n\nThree months later I was wearing my bee and when I got home I noticed that a diamond was missing. I was heart broken and furious, I took such care to make sure that would not happen! I took the bee to another jeweler and explained what had happened. He studied it and told me that the previous jeweler, Scottsdale Fine Jewelers, had taken a pair of wide pliers and clamped them over the entire piece, the possibility of the prongs being checked individually was slim to none. He also found a prong that had been cracked due to Scottsdale Fine Jewelers 'repair' work. I was incensed at what had happened! A vintage family piece, that I took such care in to make sure it was properly maintained, now needed work it did not need before. \n\nTurns out my skepticism was correct. Why a jeweler would claim a repair was completed when it was not even done to begin with is completely unacceptable. I had thought about taking it back in to Scottsdale Fine Jewelers after the diamond came out, but then decided against it due to the fact that Scott misrepresented his work. Why would I take a chance on him doing so again?\n\nI will never step foot into Scottsdale Fine Jewelers again and will tell others not to do so either. If they can't do a simple repair with full disclosure, how can they be trusted?"
0,"By far the WORST wash I have ever received anywhere, and this was a $70.00 service.  I still have stains on my passenger side carpet (which was the reason for getting the shampooing in the first place).  I don't think that they even washed it as they were supposed to.  I had to tell them for 20 minutes major areas that they had missed.   I need to clean all of  the windows myself since they are dirty still and have water spots and fingerprints on them.  The guy I arranged everything with was nice and assured me everything would be perfect.  I told him if I was going to pay so much I was going to be very picky.  He understood and guaranteed it would be perfect.  However, he was not the one doing the work.   I would be upset if I had only paid $12.00, because there are plenty of places that do a much more thorough cleaning for that.  But having paid far more, I feel the need to alert my fellow yelpers to this scam of a car wash.  My car reeks of mildew and the wet seat with whatever they used to clean stained my shorts a yellowy brown color.  Thank God I didn't have somewhere to be after the car wash.  This place is a nightmare!"
0,"ARE YOU SERIOUS!!  This place is a joke.  Not only do they do a terrible job, but they try to hustle and intimidate you into buying their super expensive detail service, especially Brain.  The constant pressure up-selling I can handle, but when they consistently return your car with water streaks, dirty windows, poorly vacuumed interior (one time they completely missed the sand in my car when they \""vacuumed\""), then it's time to go somewhere else.  Save your money, and the hassles associated with this place."
4,"These guys are great! Kelly and mark are always professional and I always refer my customers to them.  Especially for classic cars. But, they do all makes body shop repairs! Thanks guys for helping me out! See you next time my truck needs fixed."
4,Great service here....the crew does a great job!
4,Food was great!  We went back a few more times since November.  I'm very glad Al's fixed the issues that they were having and went back to very good food again.
0,"Horrible customer service!! I called to speak with the owner and a young gentleman answered saying he was the manager. I expressed to him my concern for not having \""Fragile\"" stickers for shipping. He explained that he was not responsible for those stickers and to purchase some at Staples. He said they make no money off sending packages when you prepay online. Have you ever heard of monetary value? It may cost you 2 cents to help a customer, but it keeps the customer coming back!! He then hung up on me. What a loser!!"
1,"I do enjoy the italian bread here, but there isn't enough meat, cheese or topping to enjoy it! I definitely hate to say it but subway is just on the NW corner off the 101 and Shea. Its pretty expensive and not very loaded with toppings."
3,"I really like this place.  I was in here on Sunday afternoon, and the staff was polite and friendly.  \n\nThe food tastes SO much better than other chain sandwich shops.  \n\nI typically get the small tuna sandy with lettuce, tomato, onion, oregano and a little olive oil.  \n\nThe roll at this store is always fresh, and coming from this East Coaster, that's key.  \n\nGreat place for a great lunch.  \n\nTwo thumbs up."
0,"Worst Breakfast Burrito for too much money.  For $9 - basically scrambled eggs and a flour tortilla.   I told them not to add ham because I read on their web site before I drove over that there was bacon.  No bacon and could not taste the cheese.   I asked for light egg and potato and was talked out of it...  \""we only put in 2 eggs\""  Well it was one too many.   The salsa was the horrible NYC type.   We are too close to the border for that. It was nice and hot though."
4,"Really like this place.  I usually stop in a couple times a month for lunch after I hit the gym next door.  It has a really home-y feel to it.  The service is friendly and always seems happy to have my business.  The bagel sandwiches are delicious, and the bagels especially taste fresh.  Great assortment, good menu, fair prices, good service - that's why I keep coming back!"
1,"Sub par. The service, the ambiance, the menu. The best part about Zipps is the - albeit limited - selection of draft beer! If you just need a casual hang-out spot for a happy hour, this place will do just fine."
2,"Ok sports bar, good happy Hour values.  Wings and the usual sports bar food.  Food quality is good but salad and vegetarian choices are limited, but available.  Beer by the pitcher.  Some customers get to loud and use loud foul language which the staff seems to tolerate so be aware if you take the kids."
2,"I came to AZ for work, Gainey Suites is a very clean and practical option for people looking to enjoy their stay and not break the bank.\n\nFirst off, let's discuss the perks: this place has a happy hour for guests every day with small bites...i was definitely about that life. what's more, the location and setup of the space was very picturesque and relaxing with the mountains as your backdrop.\n\nThe rooms are very comfortable and come complete with a kitchen. if i ever wind up at this hotel in another capacity, I think that's a great plus! everything is clean and well maintained too.\n\ni was happy to hear there was a complimentary daily breakfast for patrons, but the breakfast itself was rather meh.. the fruit had a brown tinge to it, the scrambled eggs were extremely runny, the pastry selection was limited, ham was dry... These experiences didn't all happen on the same day, but overall I think they can use some work on what they serve as part of their breakfast..\n\nThey also charge for the gym. which is a very basic gym....really? i could more understand if it had more amenities to it but it really didn't - we're talking treadmill, elliptical, bike, weights - the end. is that worth $20? \n\nAs far as the hotel's surroundings - there is a strip makk within walking distance with restaurants and bars./...but other than that you would need a car to drive anywhere else. \n\nBut overall it was a nice hotel - the staff is friendly and helpful. if i were to come back to AZ, i would keep this place in the back of my mind as an option..but i would also look for other potential places that might be more central or have more on-site amenities."
4,I could go on and on about how great everything is at the McCormick Ranch Golf Club.  My daughter just got married there and it was amazing.  The day prior they had a LARGE group of guys from near and far and they had an amazing time golfing!  We had my daughters wedding and reception and it was so beautiful!  Kristina is the bomb!!!  The is a true gem!  It was all just perfect!    \n\nJacque Ast\nMother of the Bride
0,The course itself is a great course. But when you drop $60.00 to play it and at the second tee you have 10 people standing there waiting to tee off it is obvious that the course management has over booked the course and don't give a darn about you waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting between and during holes. We left with four holes left as it was ridiculous. Will never play there again. If I could get a refund I would. I do not recommend playing there. Oh yes we were the 5th group off after the course had been completely cleared from a shot gun start tournament. So it was clearly over booking at its best.
2,"I only come her for Kiwanis Club of Scottsdale McCormick's weekly meeting.  Never played on-site or use any of their other facility other than the small banquet room facing the fountain area.  Overall service was good, but they do indeed need to improve their facilities."
3,"I really enjoyed this place, but first let's get ther boo's out of the way. I made reservations about two weeks in advance because I wanted to be sure I got the time slot I wanted. I made reservations for 7:30, we arrived there at 7:15. The hostess said we would be seated closer to 7:30 and that was fine. So we sat in the bar... and sat... and sat some more. It was almost 8 till we were finally seated. I saw people walk in get seated shortly after but not us and it was just a party of four. Finally get seated then ordered more drinks.. that took awhile... ordered an appetizer and that took awhile.... then the soup comes out AND that takes awhile... finally our entrees didn't come out till 9:14.. (I was checking my watch then) so we didn't leave the restaurant till 10... I thinking they were really lacking waiters. If the hostess seated us at the time I made reservations then it wouldn't have been so bad. But eating so late leaves awfuly bloated. Ok ok, now the good part. This is one of the best seafood restaurants I've been to in Arizona. It's fresh and delicious. I didn't have the salad bar, but it looked really really good. They have a good wine list and the apps are good too. We were way too stuffed to try the lava cake, but there's always next time. Just make reservations an hour earlier, ha!"
3,"The last time I'd been to the Chart House was when I was 8 years old, but at the original location in Aspen, Colorado. It's everything I remember it to be. \n\nIt's a restaurant you plan on going to--a \""special occasion\"" worthy place. This location is no exception.  Expect upscale dining in a gorgeous setting. Be sure to make a reservation and ask to be seated by the windows.  \n\nThe waitstaff go out of their way to ensure that you are having an enjoyable meal.  The maitre'd even comes by as you near dessert to introduce himself.  \n\nThe fare is mostly fish and beef. I enjoyed the seafood grill: Asian glazed salmon, shrimp scampi, and a jumbo-lump crab cake with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and asparagus. I devoured every last bit of fish on my plate. \n\nOne highlight of dining here is the salad bar. Yes, the salad bar. But it's different--it's the Chart House salad bar!!!\n\nOrder an entree and for $8.50 you can enjoy unlimited caviar, fresh fruit, cold salads (i.e. pasta salad, potato salad, artichoke heart salad...) and traditional salad bar items. Or, for $16 you can make this your entree. Savor this. Go back for seconds. And thirds. Maybe even fourths. \n\nI wasn't expecting our entrees to come out so fast. 14 minutes to be exact, the waiter informed us...a little too fast for such a high-end restaurant. I prefer to savor my salad bar items. Linger a bit before the big show, if you know what I mean. \n\nToward the end of the meal an inebriated party of four was seated next to us. What a scene. When you're paying top dollar and expecting a pleasant dining experience, the last thing you want is drunkards offering to buy your table shots. Completely uncalled for. I know it's not the restaurant's fault, but they shouldn't have seated them in the first place. It's not a sports bar--it's the Chart House!"
1,"The waiter I had at this restaurant was absolutely awful. I had a party of 10 on a slow night. For our soups and salads, he forgot my soup, but brought everyone else's. whenever there was food left on someone's plate, or if they weren't finishing a drink fast enough for him, he would very awkwardly ask if we did not like whatever it was. This would be an okay question to ask maybe once to someone at our entire table if it truly looked like something was wrong, but he asked this question to every person at least once. He was overall just very awkward and provided bad service. \nWhen the food came, I was surprised to see that the plate was very dirty. The fish did not taste fresh and made me feel sick."
2,"They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that. \n\nOver the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. \n\nSo it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.\n\nWe arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL\n\nThere was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!\n\nWe started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.\n\nThings started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. \n\nFirst it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, \""oh yeah.\""  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. \n\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). \n\nThe current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. \n\nOur bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. \n\nNow why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.\n\nFor a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw"
2,"My cousin and her fiance had their engagement party here on the Patio which connects to the lake and park. Never having eaten here before I don't know if I got the best impression from the pre-prepared catered food. We were served their sliders, sandwiches, fruits and veggies, and cheese and crackers. Nothing that could really make an impression! I thought the restaurant looked nice enough, but everything came off as a little bland."
0,"This is made of cinderblock and cement. If that is your aesthetic taste, go for it.  My room flooded twice, my patio flooded, the hallway ceiling was caving in, and it took 3 days to fix it.  And to be frank, no one at the hotel seemed to care. There are too many other nice hotels and resorts in the Scottsdale area to stay at this one."
4,"Due to an unfortunate situation that left me without AC on one of the hottest days of 2008 (yesterday) I was forced to find a place to spend the night where I wouldn't wake up in drenched sheets.  Thanks to a low bid on Priceline that was somehow amazingly accepted, I ended up spending the evening at the lovely Hyatt Gainey Ranch - I'm not kidding, I bid $55 and they accepted!  I wasn't even trying to get into this hotel, just looking for a nice one, cheap - I'm frugal :)  Other people were paying upwards of $300 last night, and I got in for $69 after tax - AMAZING!\n\nI went thinking I could get lots of work done on my laptop, but when I ventured downstairs to view the grounds I fell in love and decided that I must try out their pinot grigio (on a side note, I think I should make a list of best pinot in the city because all of my reviews have to do with it).  The lobby bar is beautiful, open and airy and there were even ducks venturing in to say hello.  The staff was very polite and helpful.  A friend decided to meet me there for dinner, so while I ventured outside for a cigarette (I know, I know) I examined the pool area (beautiful) and even found a lovely terrace area with string lights above it overlooking the lake - I am in love!  I think that I must get married here.  Now, for the pesky problem of the engagement ring...just a formality, at least I know where the nuptials will take place...but I digress.\n\nThere are so many lovely seating areas and the only thing that made me sad was that I could not be there to take advantage of the lovely pool area during the day.  There were some renovations going on, but it did not affect my stay in the least and I didn't hear a thing.  The only thing I found a bit weird was that I had a corner room so my balcony was connected to my neighbors, separated only by wood lattice-work that didn't have any vines on it and was so high that I could have ducked and walked below it.  Good thing my neighbors weren't crazy psycho killers.  However, it did make the idea of sitting on my balcony, eating my lox bagel and drinking my coffee this morning a little less appealing because I would have had to stare at, and share the space with my neighbor...kinda awkward."
2,Pool is in major need of renovation! Bugs everywhere in pool too. Very filthy.
3,"Amazing amazing place for a mommy and daddy get away here in town :) we went on the grinolda ride and our tour guide was just so wonderful. For the price of the food and the booze... I couldve made it better at home but, thats a five star get away for ya!"
4,"Fabulous resort!  We checked in and were promptly offered a complimentary margarita!  Registration service was top notch - Sichi was fantastic!  She answered all of our questions and made us feel very welcomed.  \n\nOur room was beautiful - complete with the typical amenities (safe, small refrigerator, free wifi, etc.).  Our room also had 2 comfy robes.\n\nThe resort grounds are absolutely gorgeous with plenty of pools and dining options to choose from.  We spent a little time at the family pool - but mostly enjoyed the cabana service at the adult pool.  The only negative comment I would have about the pool amenities is that the hot tub is actually located in the family pool area and was always filled with kids when we tried to access it (I thought kids weren't supposed to use hot tubs?).   \n\nThe cabanas were well equipped with a small couch, 2 chairs, end table, coffee table, mini refrigerator, ceiling fan, and a cable TV.  Rental is $250/day and also includes a fruit platter, guacamole, salsa & chips platter (all were served delightfully cold, fresh, and tasty!) and unlimited bottled water).  The first day, our server was fantastic.  The second day, our server was rarely to be found and we left the day a bit disappointed.  Not to worry though, we expressed our concerns to Sichi who quickly took care of matters to our satisfaction.\n\nEvery day we had breakfast at the SWB. If you have the option to get the breakfast package with your room - do it!  Well worth the additional $15/day.  The breakfast package includes any entree on the menu, along with a juice and coffee.  As an alternative, you are also offered the breakfast buffet - which has scrambled eggs / whites, roasted potatoes, bacon/sausage, eggs Benedict (delicious!), bagels w/ typical toppings, fresh fruit, oatmeal, yogurt, pastries, and also a made-to-order omelet station).  \n\nWe also dined at the SWB for lunch.  The Mediterranean salad and the prime rib sandwich were fantastic.  The Meyer Natural Angus Burger was delicious as well.  Both were served with Parmesan truffle french fries.\n\nFor dinner, we dined at Alto ristorante e bar, where all of their pastas are homemade daily.  I had the pasta di campanelle granchio (crabmeat w/ basil cream sauce) and my husband had the pasta di parpadelle e salsiccia speziata italiano (pasta w/ spicy sausage).  Both dishes were fabulous.  You could tell the pasta was homemade - it was light and not heavy at all.  Highly recommend those two dishes.\n\nThe hotel also offers live entertainment - I believe it is every day.  In addition, throughout the day, they have several activities planned for both children and adults.  \n\nLastly, dinner at Alto will score you a free ticket for their Gondolier ride (otherwise $10/person).  The ticket does not have to be used the same night. During the 15-20 minute ride, you are serenaded by a trained opera singer.  We were serenaded a song by Andrea Bocelli and one by Frank Sinatra (at our request)!  :)\n\nWould highly recommend Gainey Ranch and can't wait to return!\n\nUPDATE:  Loved our last experience so much that we just booked a return visit and will be back there at the end of September to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary.  Looking forward to relaxing and celebrating at Gainey Ranch!"
2,"Maybe I've had better Chinese in the past than I realized, or perhaps I ordered the wrong things, but I can't see giving this place five stars. The egg rolls were too salty, the hot and sour soup was lacking in sour, the vegetable pork was bland.\n\nIt's quick, not over priced and not over cooked. I'm willing to try it again."
2,"I have been on a Chinese food kick lately, and with not a lot of Chinese food in the area, Qwik Chinese is really my only option.  My coworker is in love with this place and has been raving about it for months so I decided to give it a try.  I have been three times now, and while I like some of the dishes, I have been very disappointed with the rest, especially since I think Gary who runs the place is just such a nice guy and I want to keep coming back.\n\nThe best thing that I have had here by far is the Shrimp Lo Mein, they don't skimp on the shrimp and the noodles have lots of flavor.  I also have enjoyed the Crab Rangoon a couple of times, they are generous with the filling, but I wish they were folded over like a turnover rather than the fancy flower shape, they would be much easier to eat that way!\n\nMy disappointments have come when I venture away from the lo mein.  The sesame chicken was just weird, I had to just throw it away, I was too scared to eat it.  The Mongolian pork was actually pretty tasty, but the ratio of green onions to pork was like 3:1, so I felt like I had been ripped off.  Last time I decided to try the orange beef; the beef was surprisingly tender but it had no flavor, it just tasted like beef, the orange sauce was completely lacking and I was sorely disappointed.\n\nI will probably get food from here again because it is close by and really the only option I have, but I am probably just going to stick to the shrimp lo mein and crab puffs and call it a day."
4,I am always pleased at Galileo's. The food is phenomenal and you can't find better service anywhere else. The owners are amazing because they really make you feel welcomed and right at home.
4,"Stopped in for a morning pastry and coffee.  It was December and they were in full christmas mode.  Pannetones being offered for order, and the like.  The pastry case was full of a huge selection of different pastries.  A nice lady took my order of almond croissant and gave me my coffee.  Good coffee, and the croissant was a-freaking mazing.  Sorry, but regular words wouldn't do.  Fresh, so flakey and full of real buttery goodness.  Some tecchies with atrocious cell phone manners had sandwiches and salads at the next table over and seemed happy.  I definitely was happy to find a rare bakery that makes excellent pastries. Themselves.  I overheard the lady at the counter say she gets there in the wee hours of the morning to start baking. I don't get to that neighborhood much, but will stop in as often as I can for sure."

4,"I was around when SGC first started talking about building a state of the art gun range and retail outlet. To be honest, I was skeptical the market could handle an upmarket gun store. I have been shooting competitively my entire life, and currently shoot three to four times a week in organized matches. \nSo I was, and am still thrilled at the success of the Club. Their prices are not unreasonable, considering the location, and their staff are great.\nI have taken their Concealed Carry Course with Attorney Tim Forschey. He is in a word, awesome! This is my fifth CCW course (I repeat them to stay up to date with changes in the law) and to be honest, the legal side is a little boring. But Tim is great, making it both interesting, as well as practical.\nI have also shot at their indoor range, and its a great facility.\nI have heard people say not all their staff are helpful. I guess all businesses have that, but I know many of the their people, and the ones I deal with are experts in their field."
3,"Been a member for 6 months and really like it. \n\nScottsdale Gun Club never gouged like the others when ammo was in short supply and I appreciate that. \n\nIt's a great club with an incredible training staff (I have taken 3-4 classes and each one was top notch). \n\nMy only suggestions are they need more classes as they book up fast and are booked out months in advance. \n\nOn weekends and holidays there is usually a short wait. A few other reviewers complained about the fact that Scottsdale caters to members and puts members in the front of the line. Ahhh of course they do - IT'S A CLUB so members should and do always get to use the club first, visitors second. \n\nMy only other critic of the club is that many times it is difficult to find someone to help when you are looking to purchase. Dark blue shirts are newbies and work the register and range checkin - black shirts do the selling and red shirts are management and trainers. \n\nIt can be frustrating when you want to see a firearm or have a question and you ask a blue shirt - they sorta look at you like huh!\n\nSo if you want to buy - find someone with a black shirt and flag them down."
4,"I've been a member here for a little over a year.  This is a very nice gun range.  There are 30 shooting lanes and an exclusive VIP section for Titanium Club Members Only.  I've only shot once at the Titanium Club, that was courtesy of a family friend who's a member....that experience is like a country club, awesome!\n\nAs a member you can make lane reservations 24 hrs in advance, which is the way to go.  If you're not a member, the wait can be long for a lane on busy weekends and evenings, members get priority.  \n\nThe gun store section of the club has a decent selection of guns and ammo ranging from sub-compact pistols to large caliber rifles.  The accessories are plentiful.  Their prices are pretty high though, so unless you absolutely have to have it, don't waste your money....you're better off shopping online @ gunbroker and then using the FFL @ the gun club to receive your gun.  I've done this several times and it's a $20 per gun fee to do so.\n\nThe employees here are pretty knowledgable and are friendly for the most part....there are a couple that won't talk to you unless you flag them down, but most are very cool.\n\nTip - to avoid the crowds, come on a Sunday or mid-week 1 hr before closing....I've found those days/times to be the least crowded.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"
0,"Unbelievable.  The manager of this place actually claimed to Carlson that I so trashed their place that I shouldn't be allowed to stay at any of the Carlson places AFTER I placed the former review.  Before that she said she didn't want me at \""her\"" place, but referred me to a couple of other Country Inns, and even had a receptionist call to reserve our rooms there.  After this review, she claimed (to Carlson) they had to replace the carpets and furniture in their hotel due to my dog.  Really?  My dog stayed in the entire hotel, went into every room and hallway and peed so badly on everything that the hotel had to change the carpeting and furniture throughout the whole three story place?  She must've been one active little chihuahua while I was sleeping.  This just proves what a nasty, vengeful person this mgr. is, and that my assesment of her is correct.  People like that should NOT be in the SERVICE industry."
0,"BEWARE OF OUTRAGEOUS PRICES!! First let me say that I have gone to this store for years (before FEDEX it was just a Kinkos).  They have helped me with many projects and although I've NEVER been wowed by their customer service, the finished products were always ok.  But recently I needed some blueprints duplicated in a hurry and instead of running to my normal reprographic place I came here- and can barely explain my shock at the rip off pricing!! I left in a hurry and submitted a complaint on line later that day.  Store manager called and basically said \""oh well\"".  I vow to not go again and spread the word . . Save your hard earned money and use a more customer service oriented place for printing/copy needs!!"
4,"Breastnet is a wonderful facility with wonderful people.  Here is my story:\n\nI was completely freaked out after my primary care physician confirmed she felt the same lump in my breast that I did.  My Dr. told me to call an unnamed breast imaging place that my insurance would cover.  They couldn't get me into their place until a month later even though it was to be a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound in response to finding what I thought was a lump.  My husband said we couldn't wait and he called around and found that Breastnet could see us on Monday (this was on the Friday before the Monday).  We were thrilled!  I was too anxious to make it very long.  I was obsessing.\n\nBreastnet was FABULOUS!!!  They responded to how freaked out I was and were very supportive.  The technician was very sweet and helped calm me.  The Dr. was so good with me.  She told me as she did the ultrasound that it all looked good.  I was so relieved.  I squeezed her hand in joy and she was very friendly.  I highly recommend going here if you need to get your mammo and/or ultrasound as soon as you can.  Also, the atmosphere is very calming in general.  Thank you, Breastnet!"
2,"Rubio's gives me hope for fast food. \n\nMaybe it's the grass roof seating area inside (see photo), but the food is very good and it's not so cookie cutter predictable here. \n\nWe first started coming here after leaving the northwest.  Mostly because it reminded me of another great seafood place: \""Taco Del Mar\"".  I much prefer seafood, while the family enjoys beef and chicken.  The prices here are closer to Chipotle, than Toxic Hell (aka, Taco Bell).\n\nI love their original Fish Taco and it's only $1.49 on Tuesdays after 2:30.  Normally it goes for $2.79, so it's a great deal.  Another favorite is their Veggie Burrito, which is more flavorful than Chipotle and priced at the same $6.49.  But here it's a better deal because they includes chips.  Their large side of beans is also a good deal for only $1.49.  They also have a good selection of beer.\n\nRubio's is not perfect and sometimes the fish can be dry.  But most of the time, it's really very good.  The folks who work here are also great.  Mark behind the counter particularly makes you feel welcome and is good at sharing stories.  Oscar the Manager keeps the place very clean and the Salsa Bar is always immaculate (see photo).  Another plus!\n\nHere are their posted \""Fresh Rule\"" as you come in:\n1) Flavor comes FIRST; \n2) We never start your meal without YOU; \n3) Our chips, salsa and Guacamole are made FRESH; \n4) Our signature black & pinto beans are NEVER refried; \n5) We use NO lard or MSQ ever!\n\nWorks for me!\n\nThe only weakness, which is really not their fault, is the location. Rubio's is sandwich between an AT&T store and the Skeptical Chymist pub.  It has virtually no parking and because of those other two places the parking lot can be a mess at times.  I find 2:30-3:00 works best for a late lunch.\n\nThree and Half Stars Plus, or \""A-OK\"" bordering on Four.\n\nEnjoy!"
3,"The food is freshly prepared and far lighter and more flavorful than any fast food place.  The service is pleasant and efficient, at close to fast food prices.  \n\nThe mahi mahi is so flavorful, and I love the grilled fish burrittos, especially Baja style - some of the best I've ever had!  The fish tacos are also excellent, any way you get them (I've tried many different versions, always great)."
0,"Buyer beware: if you're looking for a company for SEO or any other website services, DO NOT use this company! My company signed a contract with Fasturtle with one of our sites ranking (at the time) #1 on Google. Two years and tons of money later, one of our websites has fallen off of Google completely and our other site that was #1  had slipped down to the fifth or sixth page (we were blamed for this, by the way).No proactive actions were taken when the rankings began to slip. We received no warnings when suspicious links were found (by us!) on our websites, and one of my sites was down for two days until I had a customer call and inform me it wasn't working. Fasturtle had the audacity to charge us for fixing the site that went down on their watch! Every single time we had a problem on our websites, we were the ones to locate it. Their \""customer service\"" (that's an oxymoron) is horrendous; turnover at that place is insane which says a lot (I must have dealt with at least three different \""sales reps\"" for our account) and I had countless ignored emails and calls that went unreturned. We have since dropped the disservice of this company and enlisted the services of another company and, despite the mess left by Fasturtle, are on our way back to our former high ranking. Now working with a proficient company, I can see just how incompetent the services of this company really were- I don't know what they did with our money besides let bad links on the sites, not update anything, and ignore our calls. I'm just relieved we don't have to deal with these people anymore, and I strongly caution anyone considering their services to look elsewhere."
1,This place is comparable to Buca di Beppo.\n\nDefinitely for the masses.
2,"Good, solid pizza place with lots of charm and great service. Really good salads too.\n\nGreat place to go for a birthday -- the warm chocolate chip cookie w/ ice cream is sinful. Loved it!"
3,I really like this place the only real problem is the long lines and realative lack of space due to the large number of people trying to grab a slice of this goodness. Lots on the menu with many styles of pizza available and a value slice for the smaller pocket. Cold beer at the bar. Hurry up and open at the PV Mall. See you there for some italian goodness
3,"I would go here again, but pretty much just for the pizza cookie and the cheese filled ravioli's!! We ordered the thin crust Aunt Margaritas pizza, and when it came, we didn't like it very much. The crust seemed very dry to me. So we called the waitress over, and they made us another pizza, gave us a free appetizer (the ravioli's). Woohooo for two free pizzas! The waitstaff all have cute sayings on the back of their shirts (Legalize Marinara) and we were greeted by multiple people. Our dessert was out of this world. Soft, gooey, melty, delicious humongous chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. My mouth is watering."
4,"If you are looking for a great Chicago style pizza, this is the place to go! The atmosphere here is excellent and they have a decent selection of wine and beer, especially or a pizza joint. Our server was Marissa and she was excellent! We ordered the Guaca-Tony, which is basically homemade guacamole and their \""chips\"", which is more like a chip pizza...it was fantastic!\n\nHighly recommended for pizza!,"
2,"It's a pretty big Walmart. Has its own deli among other things, a Wetzel's Pretzels and a McDonalds. Plus this place is open 24 hours (not the deli and McDonald's). Classic Walmart prices as well.\n\nNot a bad place for Black Friday either. Everything mainstream is partitioned in the center aisles rather than their usual locations. Helps get the chaos over with quickly."

0,"THIS IS THE WORST MASSAGE ENVY I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!!! I have been a member with massage envy for over 4 years and never had a BAD massage.  Sure, I've had therapists that weren't my favorite but never a massage I could not wait until it was over!  Last week that was the case!  I booked an hour and half massage because work had been so stressful!  The therapist was late by about 5 minutes and then took forever to get going.  Once she got going it was seriously just like someone was lightly applying sunscreen on my back.  She would rub a few circles on my back; switch sides do the same thing, then switch back and do the same thing - for 90 minutes!  Meanwhile the whole time sighing like she hated being there!  She never did any other part of my body than the small circle rubs on my back.  It felt like time was going by so slowly all I wanted to do was leave!\n\nI finally called back the next day and talked to the manager about this poor experience.  She assured me that this was a onetime mistake and invited me to come back in and give their location another chance.  She offered to give me a one hour massage with one of their \""best and most requested\"" therapists free of charge.  I agreed and went back in.\n\nI went in for my re-do last night.  First, I checked in with the receptionist who was clearly reading the notes from the manager after I called her.  She brought one of her friends in the back office out to read it as well.  At one point there were 3 people reading the notes about me calling in and complaining.  They were all talking about it which was so awkward because I was sitting 4 feet away and could hear everything!  Ten minutes after my massage was supposed to start the girl finally came and got me.  The massage itself was better, but not by much.  When she finished I thought to myself, \""That was short\"" and then looked up at the clock.  It was still 10 minutes until 7 O'clock when my massage was supposed to be over!  So I really only got a 40ish minute massage! \n\nI went to check out and there was a new girl at the front who made a very bratty comment of \""was everything up to your standards this visit?\"" I said it was OK and left.\n\nDo not waste your time or money by going to this location!  You will regret it!"
0,"My girlfriend and I went to check this place out, mind you I'm asian and she is half-irish/half-jamacian. We were given the coldest look when we came in. Ordered a large square pan, was given a 35 minute wait, and a hour later no pizza because we found out another group who ordered the same thing was given the pizza we ordered. BULLSHIT, that is some racist ass stuff. So he instead gave us a medium sized pan and refunded us the difference. In the end pizza was bland and cheaply made. Waste of time and money. Will NEVER come back!\n\nRATING: GARBAGE!"

3,"My coworker recommended Nadya.  I was looking for a place to go that was convenient to stop by on the way home from work. I haven't had anything hemmed in years, so I'm not sure how the prices compare. I had a pant leg hemmed shut where the stitches had come out, and a new zipper added to a pair of jeans, and it was $35.  They did a great job, and when I went back to pick them up she had me cracking up! She was helping another lady while I waited who must go there often, and they were laughing and the lady thanked her a bunch and hugged her goodbye. I think she has a great friendly personality! The only thing I was a little surprised about was prepaying, I wanted to wait to make sure everything looked good first.  They said so many people forget to come back that they have to charge up front. Nonetheless both pants turned out great!"

0,"I have been going here for years but have noticed it has been going downhill the past year. The people doing the pedicures are rough and the massages are not good at all. Recently, I had a problem with the amount I was being charged. I was quoted a price prior to the service, and they tried to charge me more when I went to pay. I asked to speak to the manager and he was very rude and did not stand behind the price his employee quoted. I won't be coming back here."
2,This is price based alone.  The quality of the cleaning was good but no different than a regular dry cleaners.  I had no idea I would be paying $41 to have a pair of slacks and one mans dress shirt cleaned.  Shame on me for not asking ahead of time but in no way did I think it would ever be that pricey.  These were not designer pants so I wonder why the counter girl didnt alert me and wonder why Id be paying so much these to be normally cleaned.  I would go back if I had a fancy item because they do have attention to detail but never again for my normal dy cleaning
4,"We've been going here for my soon to be six year old son since he was two. He's been cursed with bad genetics in his teeth so we've had cleanings, fillings, kids root canal and x rays here.  Dr Ramsey and his team are caring and gentle, the wait time is very little as well. They have plenty of toys in the waiting room just in case. \n\nTo have your child sedated for dental work is scary but they are a great office and take good care of my son- I wasn't so worried!"

I said to my wife, there is something different about the MENU given to us. It's NEW and limited options and the texture is what raised a red flag for me being the very observant one!\n\nShe said I was crazy...My wife asked the server were we given lunch menus? She said that is our normal menu and walked away. I questioned a SECOND time after my wife & friend agreed with me that there WAS something different. We got the attention of our server and she said, yes we have a new ownership and this is the selection they are going with.\n\n3) Gone are the Meatloaf, Chicken dishes! It's all geared toward FRENCH style food!\nEven the names of the NEW dishes have a FRENCH flavor ring to them.\n\nEX: La Granduer Burger etc...\n\n4) Since I was limited what I REALLY wanted, I settled for the $8.99 Burger with fries.\nI ADMIT it was a very good burger but NOT what I wanted at Mimi's. I asked for light on the Thousand Island sauce...it came dripping down the sides of the burger..within minutes was a soggy mess! I had to go thru several napkins and finished half of it using a fork & knife! Btw, was never asked HOW I wanted my burger cooked.,..\n\n5) The place wasn't busy at all when we arrived....We waited 20 minutes just to get our bread options, another 10 minutes after that to get our (3) entrees and ONE was a Large Salad. We questioned the server why it was taking so long? She said our dinners would be next out,waiting on french fries....(30 Minutes) to provide ONE LARGE SALAD, ONE Turkey Dinner & One La Grandeuer style burger in a non-busy location. I JOKING said they must have had to go kill & hunt down my burger!\n\nLuckily, it all arrived HOT and the salad was perfectly prepared for our friend  enjoyed it very much.\n\n6) Server gave us plenty of refills and was pleasant during our early dinner service.\n\n7) I NOTICED why the place was empty, due to the limited menu in my opinion.\nI also noticed quite a few seniors did arrive after us, but hardly any younger people having dinner & it was 6pm-630!\n\n8) Would I recommend? ER, Noooooooo... STAY away when there are other choices for quality food nearby....I cannot give it a TWO rating. maybe 1.5 is a better barometer for judgement..."
1,"They updated their menu and now have very very limited choices.  We had a group of six of us the other day.  The waitress a heavy set lady acted like we were doing her a favor by being there rather than the other way around.  She never smiled and seemed not to care.  We had to asked her numerous times for things and she even left things off menu items we ordered more than once.  The tomato bisque has cayenne pepper in it and is very spicy, tastes and has the thickness of a tomato paste rather than a soup/bisque.  The children's meals are very very small geared more for a 2-6 year old rather than a 10 yr old. The salad are very small compared to the price and only feed one person  who is not very hungry.  Like I said previously new menu with limited offerings which are not worth the price.  no longer a good option for anything except maybe pancakes."
1,"It's sad to say that I wasn't very impressed.  While the meal my wife had, grilled chicken, was moist and very tasty, my meal, a 28 day aged New York Strip had a lot to be desired.  First it was over cooked, I ordered Medium, it came out Medium Well.  The second time it was only 2 steps past Rare.  I didn't send it back a second time due to wanting to get home and put an end to this bad experience.  The other issue I had was seasoning, as there was none, no salt, no pepper, nothing.  \n\nAlthough my food was less than desirable, the server was very pleasant.  I'm not sure I'll be back but if I do return, steak will not be on my most desired list."
1,"I tried, I really tried. I wanted to like Two Men and a Pizza. \nClever name, close, independently owned.  I called them because I got a flyer on my door and they had a great special, 14 inch cheese pie for $5.00.  When I found the place it was small, clean and the person at the register was nice.  He told me all about their other offering, wings, sandwiches, deserts.  I love supporting small, family owned pizza joints. \nWhen I got my pie I was excited to get it home and try it. \n\nOne thing I do not like about pizza is when the crust is soft and chewy.   I like a crisp crust.  So a few weeks later I thought, \""Well maybe I just should have specified\"" that I like it \""Well Done\""  so I thought I would try it again.  my order came to $12.50 for a pizza AND 10 wings.  What a deal!  Only this time the crust was even more chewy and soft then before.  Very disappointed.  They are very nice people. \nPerhaps I will try a sub sandwich from there sometime. \n\nBut I am done with their pizza."
1,"This place never gets it right. I recently took my car in for their $26 oil change/lube/car wash special, where you basically get a free car wash. The service guy was very nice, noting things I probably should replace, but that I could wait on for another few thousand miles.  He did let me know that I needed a new air filter and offered to upgrade the car wash to a supreme if I went ahead and replaced the filter, which I agreed to. However, I specifically asked that they 1) not forget to include the air freshener, which my mom said they always forget , and 2) vacuum the interior very well, since I'd had my dogs in the car and hairs were all over. I get the bill for my car and they've charged me for the upgrade to supreme car wash, so I have to have them remove the charge. Then I get my car and they've forgotten the fragrance. Finally, I get home and look at the hatch area of the interior to find it covered in sand and dog hairs, like they never even vacuumed at all, let alone vacuuming especially well, like I requested. This place is for the birds, to be polite, but they do have a very nice waiting area, if that's what you like in a car wash."

When I went to Cobblestone, and explained the problem, ti turns out that the \""guarantee\"" is that they refund your insurance company the $30 they charged for the repair!

Because over the past few years I've visited this place it's been really inconvenient to get a car wash and gas.  \n\nThe place is always super busy because it's located near a busy intersection.  That means that the lanes are crowded and the lines can get long for the car wash.

1,I bought a groupon to try this place out.  I'm not impressed with the wait as I was told half hour and it's been over an hour.  And there were upcharges.

4,"I've lived here for 1.5 years and am surprised to see anything less than stellar reviews - especially ones posting outlandish claims.  For purposes of this review, I'll focus on my experience since becoming a tenant.  As others have stated, the complex itself is fantastic - great grounds, pools, apartments and location.  However, it is the staff which necessitated I leave a five-star review.  I have been a serial renter and have found the staff at The Dakota to be top notch and 2nd to none.  I have leaned on them heavily and admittedly, have been demanding at times.  Whether it is picking up my weekly deliveries or setting high expectations in terms or my service requests, they have always gone out of their way to accommodate me, show proper urgency and handled with professionalism and a welcoming demeanor.  If you're in the market for a new place and want to know more than what brochures and websites convey, have confidence in the team here.  Cheers -"

1,"My primary care physician here in Phoenix referred me to AZ Advanced Dermatology on Highland in Phoenix for an evaluation of several suspect moles and other skin markings several years ago.   That visit with Dr Machnau was unremarkable.   I had quite a bit of sun damage on my skin in my youth so I figured I should be checked every few years and just had another appointment with Dr Machnau this past week.  I have to say it was the shortest appointment I've ever had with an MD in my life (I'm 55 years old).    The doctor arrived in the examining room and I swear she was in and out of there in 3 minutes.   She VERY rapidly examined my face, scalp, shoulders, back, chest, legs, and feet.   There was precious little interaction or communication with me.   I have to say that it's seems hard for me to believe that a skilled physician could so quickly perform a careful inspection of an entire body.   The visit certainly did not inspire confidence that every spot and lesion was evaluated.   I will certainly make arrangements to see another dermatologist the next time I get checked."

Frames, candlesticks, serving trays, bowls, wine buckets, mirrors, and crosses, are only some of the hundreds of items that fill the warehouse. Named after their daughter, Holland, Holland Boone Home is not just known for metalware anymore. The thirteen thousand square foot show room also houses gorgeous one-of-a-kind furniture, Italian pottery, wall hangings and clocks, Mexican glass, seasonal decorations, and much, much more. Add style and color to any room in your house. With new shipments arriving weekly, there are always interesting new pieces to discover at Holland Boone Home."
3,"OK, it's Subway so you get the general idea of the place.\n\nI am a fan of this particular location for a couple of reasons:\n\n1.  Parking - there is lots of it as it's next to a Bashas supermarket\n\n2. Lunch Prep - they always have around 5 sandwich artists at this location at lunch.  They draw a brisk lunch crowd but move through it quickly\n\n\n3, Ingredients - Their sandwich toppings are always fresh - never looked like they had sat out too long like some other places.\n\nThat's it!"
3,"I have never stayed at a Towmplace Suites before and since the week I stayed in Tempe was Spring Break it was a tad bit difficult to book a hotel room.  This was the only hotel that had a room available even with my Marriott status.  It is a smaller version of the Residence Inn with a small kitchen.  I am not complaining at all, the front desk person was the most helpful though giving me directions to the nearest Whole Foods market etc. and because of my Platinum status with Marriott she gave me free items in the Marketplace, much appreciated.  So. with that said, it is a good option if you are a business traveler and if you are traveling to a busy city with limited hotel rooms available."

3,"Love this store!  Offers just enough variety of healthy options without putting you into sensory overload like Whole Foods does.  They have a small selection of \""quick\"" foods such as sandwiches, soups, pre-packaged salads and sushi.  I do wish they had more selection for lunch during the work week.  Prices are very competitive, the produce is hands down the best quality and price!  The bulk items are very handy!\nParking can be an issue at this location right around 6pm-ish during the week.\n\nDon't forget to bring your own bags, they give you a $.05 credit!"
0,"I was in the store for over 20 min with my 3 year old and asked if my small box of toys was ready. An employee asked the owner Lisa who was chatting with friends about her vacation plans to please finish my box, she threw everything back in my box but one item and never made eye contact while handing me my money.  So rude, will never go back!"
2,"I give this place 2.5 stars.  The condos are nice and spacious and have all the amenities one needs, at a great price when traveling with family or friends.  They say that all the condos are renovated,  these renovations were done at a budget.  Beds are very comfortable can't complain about that at all.  But for a diamond resort they came short on other things.  AC was very loud but it didn't keep me up.  The two chairs in the living room were the worst pieces of furniture I have ever sat on, but the couch was ok.  No granite and some of the edge of our countertop was peeling up.  Resort fees, pay for wifi???  Note to management.. Put the fees in the nightly room cost, people feel they are nickeled and dimed when you spring this on them in checkin.  When we walked in the room for the first time there was two nail heads sticking out of the carpet where it joined the tile.. Ouch..  I know that many people use these rooms so stuff breaks and happens,  but to the new group coming in make sure you have s good look before settling in. Other than that the pools were great.. Hot tub was nice but only 1 when they could use 2 or 3?  Staff was very friendly and got us the 3rd floor mountain view as I had requested.  No elevator is pain so keep that in mind.  I usually stay at the Westin kierland when I'm in scottsdale and that place is 5 star and outdoes this place by a long shot.  Would I stay here again?  Yea for sure when traveling with a group but if by myself prob not as I would opt for a hotel.  So give this place a try just don't expect a 5 star experience."

4,"I've had my hair cut by Scott 4 times now and he does a great job, I've never had anyone ask me where I've gotten my haircut before, but now they do. He recommended a scissor over comb( or comb over scissor?)\nCut, no quickie buzz cut. I've recommend some female coworkers and they drive all the way from chandler for him to do their hair. I've never had anyone give me suggestions about how I should wear my hair or ways to minimize that growing BALD spot but he does. Every time I walk out of there I feel better about the way i look and my shirt isn't soaked, he does this head massage when they wash your hair that is just great, and I cant tell you how long it's been since the owner of a business has come over and introduced themselves and asked if I wanted a drink or coffee from Starbucks. I look forward to getting my haircut now!"
3,"Some of the best margaritas in town (or that I've had), and the food is quite good - tex-mex style, in my opinion (as opposed to California-style Mexican). I liked the carnitas, and I've also had the combination plate: beef tamale, enchilada & taco. And both salsas are delicious!"
3,"JD and I wanted a super casual place for lunch on Saturday after a workout and he suggested here and it was the perfect spot. The chips and salsa were exceptionally good, or I had just worked up a voracious appetite at the gym, probably some of both. \n\nJD ordered a cheese crisp and I made fun of him by asking if he was on a diet. Then I ate my words when the behemoth greasy cheesy large pizza sized crisp actually came to the table. It was HUGE! A thin crispy tortilla topped with tons of melty fantastic-ness! It was cut in squares like some pizza's too which made it easy to eat. I had the Mexican Flag enchiladas and they were fine, but lackluster in comparison to the giant wheel of melted cheese across the table. \n\nAll in all it was a great meal and definitely reversed any good I had just done at the gym, but that's life and I'm fine with it!"
2,"Went here for a quick dinner. Food was just average, not too special and not as good as I would expect in the Mexican restaurant. I had an impression that we were a bit neglected by the waiter and waitress, maybe because we had a small order and didn't feel like drinking tons of alcohol, not sure. Salsa was good, but I need a bit more to Mexican restaurant than a good salsa."
0,"I will never buy tires there again!\n\nEvery time I go in there they try to sell me 4 new tires! WTF! I just bought 4 tires at Christmas.

Are you kidding me???\n\nNever again will I go there, nor will I ever refer them. I'm done!"
1,"Well for one, I walked in to use my free trial membership. The dude started trying to tell me I was doing everything wrong.\n\nThe record stops.... Excuse me. You are fat and I used to be but lost all the weight in a very healthy way. I guess I should take advice from someone who is fat. Even though I lost all the weight on my own.\n\nWTF? He was trying to push these crappy suplements and protein bars on me. Which btw have really bad ingredients.\n\nThen I tried taking a group class. 2 instructors, both .. you guessed it really fat.\n\nThey didnt ever get my heart rate up because they were so out of shape they would stop before everyone else. Everyone in the class was looking around like, are you feeling this?\n\nI used 2 of my 7 free days because other than the bad form these people were teaching they all went around telling you that you dont know what you are doing. \n\nWhen in fact I trained with 2 personal trainers for over a yr one of them was in the top 20 trainers voted by Mens Magazine. \n\nUnbelievable, plus the membership cost the same as 24 hour which they actually have to be certified to be a trainer."

3,"Love Kohl's, have been there twice in the last month, they keep sending me coupons through the mail, $10.00, coupons, I can purchase a blouse that is regular price of $38.00, on Sale for $14.99, and only have to pay a little over $6.00, using my coupon, they always have Great Sales ! And it is right up the street !"
2,"Dear Kohl's,\nI love you, I really do.  I'm brand-loyal to you since we were both born and raised in the glorious suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, However, my affection for you dwindled just a wee bit a few days ago after an unfavorable experience. (sniff!) \n\nYou got me with the $15 Kohl's Cash along with the 20% off coupon during your lovely annual Thanksgiving sale.  Man, I went to town purchasing kitchen, bathroom, and small electronic necessities on Kohls.com.  After my shopping binge was said and done, I had earned a whopping $135 in Kohl's Cash.  Score!  .....Then I went to town again purchasing a cookie sheet and luxury bed sheets for my condo.  \n\nEverything was fine and dandy as my shipments came in batches (some much earlier than expected--woohoo!) I made an error when purchasing the cookie sheet and bed sheets online and needed to return them.  Here's where the heartache came:  because $45 in Kohl's Cash was used to purchase these items, I got almost NOTHING in return for them!  \n\n----------------------\n\nThe moral of this story is that Kohl's Cash is a use-it-or-lose-it situation.  Be VERY certain you are going to keep the items you purchase with Kohl's Cash or else you are left with nothing.  Lessoned learned......I'll be back."
3,"Used my @BoldBajaFresh @Groupon for lunch today.\n\nI've always been a fan a Baja Fresh, and ate there quite often in CA.\n\nThe distance to the closest one here in AZ is excessive for regular visits.\n\nI don't really know that they are worth reviewing, per se, but I wanted to relate my experience today at this particular location.\n\nThe chips we were given seemed stale to both my g/f and I. The manager took my old chips, and grabbed a new bag to hand me.\nRather than proceed with that action, he also discarded them, and informed me he would make up a new batch, and deliver a double order to our table.\n\nThey came out hot and fresh, and delicious!\n\nIt was a nice display of customer service, an increasingly rare trait these days.\n\nThanks!"
2,Decent and cheap haircut with friendly stylists. They cut me a little shorter than I would have liked but pretty good for $14.
2,"6/8/11\n\nTook a bite of my Wholly Grill pork bbq and off came my crown cap.  Finished breakfast (yep, I had pork bbq for brekky- what are you gonna do about it?), and then looked up Ebony K.'s recommendation of a nearby dentist and called Thompson Peak Family Dental.  I mentioned my lost crown, my being a new patient, and could I also set up an appointment for a dental cleaning?  While the next opening for a cleaning wouldn't be in July, I'd have to wait till Monday for the recementing of the crown, since Dr. Dachs \""is going on vacation.\""  However, after a minute or two of speaking w/ the rep on the phone, I was able to secure a same-day appointment!\n\nDr. Dachs seemed friendly and open to conversation (he and his two kids are going to visit a national park!).  He worked quickly to prep the crown for recementing.  I was on that chair for less than 10 minutes!  (Well, OK, maybe slightly longer than that, since we chatted for a few minutes on his taking his kiddies off to their first nat'l park excursion.)\n\nI noticed a wi-fi decal on a nearby clinic door as I headed to the dental clinic, so I asked the front desk if they offered free wi-fi, too, and they were very gracious to offer the password w/o much begging from me.  Just a simple query, and I was able to check my messages and do a check-in update  via Yelp!  :)  \n\nThank you, TPFD, for a hassle-free first visit!"
0,"I saw good review on yalp so I visited Dr. Dachs.\nInstead of crown he filled my tooth. The pain last.

1,"Rude front desk clerk, Jack. Sounded annoyed when I called to complain about the room next door and their howling dog for the 2nd night in a row. Lame breakfast bar and the advertisement for a kitchen in the room is actually a tiny little door that has a mini microwave and mini refrigerator. No stove. Wouldn't stay here again even for free."
1,"I've been to Scottsdale Nails twice, today was my second time. The first time I went I had a great experience and even started telling my friends to try it out. Today was a different story...\n\nI always get the same gel color and noticed they had it last time I was in which was 2 weeks ago. I looked for it forever through the endless bottles they have to choose from (shouldn't that be their job?) and was unable to find what I was looking for. I was told I could start my gel manicure and they would look for it later. I was not comfortable with that and told them I wanted a specific color and if they didn't have it I would like to go to the Nail salon I knew would have it. They finally found it and sat me down. Linda was my tech and she immediately began to file my polish off which I asked politely not to do since I've had issues with them being filed in the past creating brittle nails that bleed from being so thin. She argued with me and said soaking would take too long, she even had another nail tech try and talk to me about it. I continued to ask for it to be soaked off just like they did last time. For goodness sakes why is that such a difficult request??? Finally she did what I was asking and then would not stop telling me how wrong I was about the filing causing my nails to be so thin, painful and bleed. I told her she was not correct that since I've asked people not to file the color off I've had no problems. We went back and forth many times. She also kept walking away and talking on her phone then went to an area by the restroom where many other tech were standing around and all of them were laughing and one even pointed at me!!! I can't tell you how angry I was! Here I am paying for a service and am trying to be nice and had a few requests that were not that big of a deal. I don't think I will ever go back. I will go back to my previous salon and bring my friends with me! The only reason I gave 2 stars is because I had a better experience the first time or else it would be 1!"
1,"I've been here a few times since I moved in across the street about a year ago. Usually I'm in for a pedicure and I'm out. Their pedicures are decent, nothing special but appropriately priced. I've tried other places in the area because my brow lady that practices right next door to this place says the manicurists are treated like crud. Next time I'll take that more to heart, but I was in the area and needed a pedi so I stopped in again.\n\nI recently got into the gel manicure trend. I have had a few done at other places and decided to get one while I went in for my usual pedi. My manicurist, Debbie, didn't speak to me at all, even when I tried to compliment her technique. She also gave me a massage while my hands were in her hair which I was turned off by.\n\nThe polish on my thumb chipped the next day. I know this isn't the norm for gel manicures so I went back after work. The manager at the desk listened to my complaint and attempted to fix it herself.\n\nShe didn't remove the remaining (unchipped) polish and instead tried to file the remaining polish down to my nail. She then slapped more polish on. When she was done and asked for my approval I said it looked lumpy (it's a duochrome polish so the lumpiness is enhanced) and she attempted to fix it by putting on more topcoat.\n\nMy nail is still lumpy and I will not be returning."
1,"This used to be my favorite Chipotle but over the past two years the food quality has gone down hill. The chicken is consistently burnt and sometimes the mild salsa is tasteless, on the other hand the staff is always friendly. If your hungry for Chipotle drive the extra 5 minutes to 92nd street and Shea and you won't be disappointed."
1,I am not as big a fan of this place as some of the other rook your burrito chains but this particular location has the fattiest chicken and on 2 occasions the food here has made me sick.
1,Slowest chipotle I have ever been to. Watching people leave after standing in line so long. It's like this every time I come. Today thought if would not be bad ad there were only about 5 people ahead of me but it'd still forever.
0,Never really had a problem with this chipotle But had a terrible experience today. Employees were super rude from start to finish. Awful customer service. The lady at the end started rolling my burrito before I was even finished ordering. Never asked if I wanted anything else. Brought it home and right as I began to eat I noticed a decent sized black line on my tortilla - sharpie. Avoided the entire middle of my burrito. Sharpie isn't toxic but it's still not good to ingest. Disappointing because this chipotle is very close to my house. But it isn't much farther to go to 90th and Shea. I will not be returning to this location.
3,"I have to say that I love the burgers at Red Robin.  They have a great selection and come with unlimited fries.  I like the burgers so much that I never tried anything else, however, my wife loves the whiskey river barbecue chicken wrap.  They also have a lettuce wrap burger that my wife gets sometimes to keep carbs down.\n\nThe service is a little hit or miss.  It is usually pretty good, but not great.  This is especially true if you get seated in the bar area in my experience.\n\nRed Robin is one of our regular places to go because of the reasonable prices and great burgers.  BEWARE - Tuesday night is kids night!"
1,"My friend has this seriously strange love with Red Robin.\n\nShe called me on Thursday, \""I'm forwarding an email to you. It's a coupon from Red Robin - let's go! My treat!! But you have to print the coupon for me!\"" So I hopped in my little car and off I went to PHX.\n\nWe sat in the parking lot and she went, \""Oh...it's  Mimi's Cafe. Do we want Mimi's or Red Robin?! Nevermind, I have a coupon for Red Robin, let's go!!\""\n\nIt wasn't late on a Friday night - about 8:30pm...and the restaurant was really quiet. We waited at the entrance, waiting for someone to seat us, but no one came forward. I noticed at the end of the bar a girl on the phone, giggling and laughing into the receiver...I had a sinking feeling she'd be the one to seat us. She saw us a couple of times and turned her back each time. After a few more mins she came and sat us down...turned out she would be our server as well. *sigh*\n\nShe was great in ordering, but as for refilling drinks? Not so much. Didn't help that the restaurant was 4% full. It's hard keeping track of all 2 of your tables, isn't it?\n\nI enjoyed my fish burger, but not my fries. I ended up eating some of my fries because well...I was hungry and it was clear she wasn't going to come back after she dumped the bill on us. Oh wait, she did come back as I was halfway through my food (I am a slow eater) and tried to take my friggin plate away. Why didn't I enjoy my fries? It looked and tasted like the kitchen had taken old fries and refried them. :(\n\n\""Oh, I'm sorry. I totes thought you were done!\"" *insert insipid airhead giggle here*\n\nI had food in my hands and I was chewing. What gave her the idea I was done?\n\nI couldn't even ask for water because my mouth was full. I should've because I ran out of water...and I was thirsty by the time the meal ended.\n\nThere was more 'small things that added up to a whole big amount of pissed off customers' in my friend and I, but I won't even go there.\n\nAs a former waitress, just because it's slow it doesn't mean that your service has to slack...ok?\n\nIf my friend *ever* suggests this Red Robin again, I'll tell her I'd rather go to McDonald's."
1,"Was very disappointed with the food, the hamburger was small and not so hot.  Cooked well but not flavorful, the fries were cold and soggy,  The only redeeming quality about the meal was the service was friendly and attentive, A little expensive for a hamburger,"
0,"I have taken my 2012 Toyota Tacoma here twice for a oil change, both times I have been totally disappointed with the service ..... Not only do they try to sell you every service they can they wash your windows ( which look like they used muddy water ) leave greasy handprints on fenders and doors and last but not least when they put my cabin air filter back in they did not take the time to replace the glove box shock causing it to fall all the way down when opened ......"
3,"'Yay! I'm a fan' is right. This is one of my favorite Starbucks -- I missed it this weekend during their renovations. The service is great, the drinks are accurate and everyone generally seems pretty happy to be there. \n\nOnly complaint: Please carry more of the chocolate croissants. Thank you."
0,"My experience here Dr Hollis Underwood should thank me that I have only written negative complaints to her directly and now in yelp. The experience I had here would be worthy of a complaint to the medical board. \n\nI called to make an appointment to establish myself as a patient the Monday after Labor Day and was in need of an urgent visit as a follow up from an ER visit after a car accident. The first available appointment was December 3rd. \n\nI was forewarned that Dr Underwood doesn't limit her time with her patients to the 15 min insurance companies allow her to bill for and therefore requires her patients pay an additional $150 a year. On the phone I was told I could decide to pay this fee after my initial visit but that wasn't what happened when I got there. \n\nThere was a terrible wait. Then I wS taken back for some preliminary tests and brought back out to wait some more. \n\nI was given really unnecessary tests for someone in their 30s such as a bone density test, EKG and the list goes on. \n\nDr underwood was eager to diagnose me with several severe diseases none of which I even had adequate symptoms to consider an adequate concern she was dying to give me a Pap smear but I had seem my Gyno for my annual well woman exam the day before so that too was unnecessary. \n\nHer staff for the most part were short and abrasive and her scare tactics were disgusting and unappreciated. \n\nMost outrageous was that she ordered tests be sent to me to do at home and send back without ever discussing them with me. Unacceptable!!!\n\nShe doesn't contract with reputable medical facilities like medical imaging and instead has a mobile unit out of another state come to her office monthly. WTF???\n\nWhen I voiced my concerns to her in writing there was not even an attempt to apologize or clear up any confusion. She was simply happy to keep my $150 and who knows what she was collecting from my insurance and let me move on to the next doctor. \n\nI did immediately seek a second opinion and all of her serious concerns were found invalid at Scottsdale Healthcare. \n\nI always enjoyed the prizes in Cracker Jax boxes myself but I prefer my doctors licenses carry more credibility than the cracker Jax prizes.   \n\nRun, don't just walk away from this one and see any other doctor instead."
1,"I let my experience here simmer for a long time. I kept putting off writing a review because I did not want to offend anyone...but after getting a few good haircuts again I decided to vent and write a review...after all doesn't a good yelper write about the good...and the not so good?\n\nI went to this place based on the great yelp reviews. I made an appointment for a haircut and color.\n\nLets start with the color...she left it on for (I felt like) a very long time. After the color was washed out I touched my hair and already felt a ton of breakage. I mean pieces of hair were just coming off in my fingers. I don't know what happened...if it was left on for too long or the color was too strong...but my hair had never been that damaged before. Also...the color was just not what I asked for...the highlights were very chunky and unnatural and the brown faded super fast. \n\nAs far as the cut went...I had a super cute haircut that I got in LA that just needed to be trimmed up again. Instead it was just made to look like a \""soccer mom\"" cut. Chucks of hair were cut that just did not need to be. When I went back to my hair guy in LA he remarked...\""wow....you were really hacked into weren't you\"".\n\nThe salon was nice...but I was just not happy with my haircut or color."
4,"I've been coming to see Jen Botto for about a year now and she is just fantastic, she does my cuts and my highlights. She is the most efficient stylist when it come to highlights. I would recommend her to anyone, especially if you are looking for a modern or up-to-date haircut. She's always able to give me exactly what I want, and I can be pretty picky some times."
1,"Came here because we had a gift certificate from an online deal- very hard to find tucked back between two buildings in the corner of the shopping center. The staff members are rude to eachother and loud so you can hear them even when they're back in the kitchen- really kills atmosphere. Sat at our table for 5-10 minutes before we were greeted (waitress did apologize for leaving us sitting there so long).  I liked the edamame, miso soup & tempura were pretty good, but the main course (beef teriyaki & sushi) were average at best which is not saying much for a sushi place. Restaraunt was dirty inside, thick layers of dust on almost anything you looked at- all light fixtures, booths, walls, wood trim... makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is if they don't clean the places you _do_ actually see. Highlight was our waitress, very knowledgeable about the menu, and very sweet & genuine, if not for her, this probably would've been a 1 star."
0,"The service at Sushi Ko was terrible.  Our waitress was rude.  I think we were inconveniencing her by needing things like tea or plates or sushi...  We tried to get her attention, then we tried to get anyone's attention to bring us plates and little bowls for our soy sauce.  We eventually retrieved our own plates.  When we asked about the bowls for soy sauce, we were told they \""were out\"", even though we could see a little stack of them in the restaurant.\n\nThe sushi itself was acceptable, if forgettable.  We had a rainbow roll, spicy something or other, and tuna sashimi. The rolls were a little loose and hard to eat.  \n\nI won't be eating there again unless they make some staffing changes."
4,"I am a big fan of Chipotle... nothing new there. The only reason I ever hesitate to eat here (especially, this location) is because it is so damn busy... However, today, for the first time I used their fax order form- Totally awesome. I faxed it in, I called to confirm, I got there, the lady asked my name, handed me my bag, I paid and I left. I almost wanted to tease the suckers still in line. \n\nThis is officially now the ONLY way I will order Chipotle. Score one for me and my time!!!"
0,"I went to mail a package today and was told that if I didn't give my address, phone number and email address to put into their system they would not mail my package.  I mail through UPS and the general post office all the time and have never been told that I need to give my personal information to be logged into a system I order to mail something.  The owner \""claimed\"" that he would need to contact me if there was a problem with the package (yet my package had a return address label that should ensure that if there were a problem that it would be  mailed back to me) but when I told him that I would provide an email address and that is all he said that would not suffice.  I asked why he needed all of my personal information and if he was planning to sell it to a third party or add me to their mailing list (b/c I don't want any more junk mail, telemarketer phone calls, etc.) and he did not answer my question.  He said rather, \""Take Your Business Elsewhere,\"" if you can't give me your personal information.  I was appalled!  I promptly went across the street to UPS who mailed my package without any of my information for their system with no problem-- MAILERS BEWARE!  Do not go to this place!  Would not recommend at all!  And, the lady whom was \""trying\"" to put my information into the system could not spell... I had to literally spell my name out three times before she understood and its a common name!"
4,"I cannot say enough great things about Copyfast!  When it comes to award winning service and product production - they are at the top of my list.  It is nice to know that family-oriented, specialized copy centers still exist!  I had the opportunity to meet the owners one day, although at that time - I did not know that they owned Copy Fast.  After a brief chat with them - I can see why their copy center is the best in town.  I knew I loved this place before, but now after meeting them and hearing about the passion they have for their store, their customers and their employees - I am even more thrilled that I have this place to go to for all my copy needs!"
1,"I don't think this place is as great as they say it is.  It's pretty dirty.  Teachers don't pay that close attention.  Our child went here because everyone we knew had their kids here as it was some what reasonable but since being here, we've found so much better.  It's certainly not worth 4+ stars."
0,"Yikes, what a service nightmare.  I took my bike here for a scheduled oil change and to have a flat tire fixed.  What resulted was the age old rape the customer for every penny add as little value for as much money as possible snafu you'd expect from some mechanic stranded in the middle of the desert a la  Billy Bob Thornton's character in the movie U Turn.  \n\nThe tire ended up being the tube only, $150, okay I can live with that at the Harley shop.  The synthetic oil change $130, same deal.  I decided to go ahead with the 20K service as well, which was $385 and negated the oil change cost, so I was around $560 after tax with those services.  Painful yes, but again, expected due to the market cornering logo Harley Davidson being attached.\n\nBut here's where things went awry.  I received a voicemail from Ari in the service department the next day, as I avoided the call hoping to check my messages and simply be told the bike was done and ready for pickup, but something made leary of answering.  I checked my voicemail to find Ari had left a message detailing all the great things they had done to my bike which we had never discussed and they made the executive decision to \""fix\"" like changing my amber colored light bulbs to red and removing he smoked out lens covers, so as to allegedly keep me  with the law.  They also changed the bolt which fastened down the leather strip accessory on my back fender, as they claimed it had been digging in to my back tire when I hit bumps.\n\nOk, great.  If the things you changed on my bike without consulting me helped me to stay compliant, and prolonged the life of my tire, great.   But then Ari, ever the salesman, err customer service rep, informed me my tail lights were no longer working and it would only be an additional $185 for parts and labor to get them fixed.  To wit, I responded, my taillights were working when I dropped the bike off yesterday, and they've quit working under your care, I'm not paying for you to correct the problem you created while making changes to my bike we never discussed.\n\nAri, oh Ari, said he would talk to his manger and came back with a response that he was given permission to waive the labor cost if I paid the $105 part cost to fix the taillights.  I reiterated my position about the lights working when I dropped it off, and somehow the price went from $560 to $585 and I agreed to do it versus leaving with nonworking taillights.\n\nDuring the conversation, Ari stated Harley Davidson gets enough jobs that they do not need to drum up extra business by creating new problems.  I told him I thought that was strange he felt to address or state that when I never accused them of doing such.  Basically if you have to create and state an alibi to something that hasn't been accused, it seems suspicious.\n\nBeyond the taillight debacle, Ari stated all bikes getting serviced in he HD service dept get a custom something or other power wash, so I expected to get my bike back gleaming at the very least.  After coming to an agreement about the taillights, Ari tells me \""I'd like to give it a bath if you have time.\""  I'm thinking, ya that's part of what I paid for.  So I waited another half hour for my bike, long enough to be approached by a sales lady who informed me they'd give me a whole $3K as trade in on my aped out, customized 2008 Nightster if I wanted to buy the $19K Fat Boy Lo I was admiring.  When Ari finally brings my bike around it looks like the time I washed it in the dark after a 12 pack, like Ray Charles washed it.  I told him it was a shitty wash job, and he responded we didn't do that, we could buff it out if you want.  Not even sure what he was talking about, but basically, ever the salesman, deny all plausability or accountability, like the taillights that quit working under their watch, and try to gloss over the subject.\n\nTotally disappointing experience.  They have a sign up on the lot next door about their upcoming new facility coming soon.  Apparently they're trying to expedite their move by upcharing and upselling their customers while providing as little service as possible."
3,"Finding Ultimate Auto is liking finding some cool, signless club in Scottsdale. But once you do, you're in baby. You're in! It's located behind several car dealerships in a tiny two store strip mall type building. Unlike a club, however, they do not card you or serve drinks. But they do take credit cards and always have a pot of coffee warmed up. Greg and John have been running this business for years and have quite the cult following. And because I don't speak \""car\"", they always speak to me in a way I can understand. \""Your car is broken.\"" \""We will fix it.\"" You know, like that. I never felt cheated or scammed and they always, always let you know what's necessary and what can wait. Like the brakes are running metal on metal and the visor mirror is broken. Naturally, I had the mirror replaced first. So, ultimately, I don't want to be at Ultimate. But if I must, a cup of java and hanging with Greg and John, in this tony Scottsdale hood, just ain't so bad."
4,This review is solely based on takeout. WINNING takeout! We got a deluxe pan pizza minus black olives and a side of their famous dressing. Both were home runs! I have to buy a bottle or two of that dressing next time. And maybe even try it on a salad!
1,"There's a reason why on a Friday night several pizza places down the street have an obnoxiously long wait at 6:00pm and why Nello's only has a handful of diners.  It's just not what it once was.\n\nMy wife and I split a small caesar salad ($8.99).  It was pretty good and would have feed at least 3, maybe even four people.  However, there was a mysterious scary looking piece of mushroom in the salad.  While the random fungi wasn't something worth sending it back over.  It made me wonder what other things could have fallen into the wrong place in the kitchen.  We also split a 14\"" pesto chicken pizza ($20.49).  The parts of the pie that weren't burnt were pretty good.  Again, we could have complained, but why wait another 10 to 15 minutes for another pizza.  The good news for us, thanks to a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485), we didn't pay too much."
1,"High marks for the tasty pizza, but beware the build your own option!  We ordered a 14\"" thin crust with chicken, roasted red bell pepper, mushrooms, and feta, and the bill came out to $27.50!  I ordered from their online menu, which did not list the price of these ingredients. If I knew it would be that expensive, I would not have ordered it. I spoke with the manager who apologized for those prices not being listed on website, but stopped short of doing anything to make it right, apparently unconcerned about losing a 17 year customer. We like their pizza but there are other excellent, less pricy options we'll choose next time."
0,"Have been going to this place for about 2 years because it was close by and had decent food.  The wait staff has always been extremely great and very pleasant.  Unfortunately I will never go to this place ever again and will tell everyone I know to do the same.  Their food has gotten extremely bad...too much salt on the all breakfast food and everything else is not cooked properly.  They just put out a new menu and raised their prices by over a dollar.  Pretty sure he did that because of his other failed businesses...a mortgage company that tanked along with other real estate investments.  They don't take reservations...or I was told that when I called to make some.  So we showed up an hour early to get a good seat for the football game.  I sat at a table and then I was told to move because someone had reservations.  So we moved to another table.  Then at this table we were told to move again because of reservations.  Then we finally got a table in their back room.  So we were all watching the football games and enjoying our overpriced food and watered down drinks.  Then with about 5 minutes left to go in the game we were told that we had to leave because someone else had reservations at our table and the Owner and Manager didn't even have the guts to tell us this themselves.  They made a tiny 19yr old girl come up to 10 guys to tell them to move.  She started to cry because she felt so bad to tell us and still no help from management.  Completely classless establishment.  We offered to share our table but they wanted us to move somewhere else entirely.  If that wasn't enough, my wife and her friend were out on the patio getting some air and over heard the owner talking badly about us using profanity all over. What a classy man talking about the people who keep him in business.  What's the funniest part of everything.....the people that wanted the reservations weren't even eating or drinking."
0,Horrible service. Its sad to say this but when you are going there to watch a football game and you cant even get a refill on your drink because your waitress has gone and disappeared and doesnt return to check on you. I waited and hour for me to get a drink. I waited 45 minutes just to get the check. She aslo said that when she came back with the check she would give us raffle tickets to put in....Never came back with those tickets. I think this girl should be fired i was upset to the point were i got up and walked out. She didnt deserve a tip but i gave her one. Her name is Angela. I was there on the night of the super bowl game. I will be back to that restaurant no doubt but I cant believe that someone would hire someone like that. Horrible service.
4,Excellent customer service.  Great food.  Accept reservations.  Live music.  I don't have a single complaint.  I wish there were more like K O'Donnell's. Made reservation for 12.  9 showed up. We felt terrible.  Wait staff was beyond kind and we tipped them generously.  We'll return. Great experience.
3,"If you like your food spicy, you will like Arriba!  I know it is a chain, but it is a local chain, and they are very consistent!  They have the best spinach enchiladas around....they are amazing!  I also love that they give you bean dip and two different kinds of salsas with your chips.\n\nThe menu has pictures of everything, which makes it very hard to choose, but I usually stick to a few of my favorites.  They also have really good lunch deals like Taco Tuesday (99 cent tacos) and Chicken Chimichanga Thursdays (just $1.99).  The food is always hot and fresh, and they have good beans...which is always a benchmark for me!"
1,"I will start off telling you I'm a chef, so I expect good food, and I know when food is prepared properly. I am very critical of freshness. I'm used to cooking at home with freshly prepared everything so when I go out, I want something better than I could have made myself. This fell short in many ways. For example, the fresh tomato salsa served with my fajitas was spent. The flavors were all muted and the tomatoes had been chopped at least a day ago, possibly more. You could see they were dark, and breaking down into mush. The fajita meat had a good grilled flavor, but dry and overcooked. I ordered them with chiles for an extra dollar expecting to have them on the sizzling plate with my fajita meat, especially since they advertise their fresh roasted Hatch chiles on site, but instead they were brought a few minutes later after my meal was served, in a separate dish, cold, mushy, looking like they just came out of a can. I asked for fresh lime to squeeze over my meat and overcooked onions, and got brown dry, lime wheels served on the side of my margarita glass instead. And the margaritas! Okay the first one was .99 cents so I'm not going to complain. But the next one was a very large overpriced one that just tasted like watered down cheap margarita mix. My rice was precooked, dry and old, and way too salty. My husband's chimichanga was basically a big burrito covered in some massive amount of sauce, but it was not deep fried as I thought a chimichanga is supposed to be. Or if it was, it wasn't cooked enough because it was mushy. My kids cheese crisp was... lame. My other kid's mini chimis looked appetizing and he liked them, but they ruined the dish by putting this brightly artificially colored red mini tostada bowl on the plate filled with sour cream that had been sitting in the refrigerator either uncovered, or at the wrong temperature because it had a yellowish brown layer of old cream on the top that was just gross. Apparently they make those up ahead of time too with no quality control. Also it was very hot inside the restaurant which worried me about the safety and sanitation of the kitchen. I agree with others that the service was friendly, when they were actually there. I think it's a bit overpriced, for the quality. We spent $115 with tip, but that was two margaritas and one desert, 3 entrees, one app, one kids meal. I'd rather of had Taco Bell. And the chips were no big deal. If you've made chips at home and experienced what they taste like you would never want restaurant ones again. The texture, freshness, flavor can't be beat. I know what you are all thinking. Stay home then and cook. I usually do for just this reason. Oh and one more thing. The apple sopapilla desert was terrible. The pastry dough was chewy, and lacked salt. Tasted like chewy dish rag."
0,"We are huge fans of this place. But I think the one on Camelback is the best location. \n\nLast time we ate here the service was terrible and you could tell it was completely understaffed for a Sunday morning. My wife ordered a bloody Mary that was horrible and didn't have more than two sips. And on top of it all of our orders came out wrong.\n\nLastly, you could tell the staff was working their butts off and the manager on duty was standing around watching. In fact I saw someone dropped a fork on the floor and he stepped over it 4xs until the lady in a clown suit entertaining kids picked it up.\n\nSo for the price and what we got it was a waste of time and money!"
1,"Arriba's was not as good as they used to be, apparently the original owner passed away and its under new ownership. Won't be coming back here again."
0,"I purchased an online coupon for Quiznos by mistake, thinking it was for another sub shop located a couple minutes from my house.  It turns out this location is the closest, but further away than I'd usually be willing to travel for a sub.  However, since I now had the coupon I thought it a good opportunity to try my first ever Quiznos sub.  So I went to Yelp to read reviews for this and other locations.\n\nI was having friends stop by to swim in my pool this past Sunday afternoon (2014.0727), so decided I'd go pick-up a couple subs.  Before I did I checked their hours on both their corporate and Yelp's sites; both said it was open Sunday from 11:00 am - 8:00 pm, and Yelp even had \""Open now\"" in green letters to the right of their Sunday hours.\n\nI arrived at their front door at 3:20 pm and the place was closed with a note taped on their door \""Open 11:00 am - 3:00 pm.\""  Thus a 45-minute round-trip wasted.\n\nI'd love to provide my feedback about their food, but to-date I've never had any.\n\nWhat I can comment on is this location and their corporation.  Once back home I rechecked both Quiznos Corporate and Yelp's sites, and again they both indicated this location should have been open at this time.\n\nNot very pleased with this waste of time, I decided that rather than give this location a bad review on Yelp, I'd simply provide feedback direct to Quiznos Corporate, so I clicked on their \""Contact\"" link at the bottom, which presented another page for a few seconds than immediately returned to their opening page.  I tried this several times using two different browsers, and then tried using a different computer, but all with the same result.\n\nFrustrated, I searched for Quiznos Corporate contact info.  What I discovered from various links was even more disturbing.  Not only did I find a plethora of complaints from very dissatisfied customers on their own site (www.corporateofficehq.com/quiznos-corporate-office/), I found many other sites with negative customer feedback.  No wonder they don't want any more contact from their website.\n\nThen I learned that Quiznos Corporate filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2014 \""due to a rash of (store) closings nationwide.\""  It appears this company has problems from top to bottom.  I'm going to attempt to use my coupon (which I already paid for) before they go belly-up."
0,"A friend suggested that we play golf at Starfire, little (short) resort style course on Hayden in Scottsdale.\nI don't want to get off on a rant here, but will someone (other than me...I did tell them but the blank stares I encountered lead me to believe that my diatribe was ineffective and possibly not even understood by the staff at Starfire) tell them to give the Armor All a rest!\nI suppose the course is nice enough...I've played there many times since I moved to town.\nI suppose the prices are reasonable...I have certainly paid more to play a course in worse condition.\nSo why the one star for a place called Starfire? Somebody needs to tell the morons in the cart barn or out in the staging area to give the Armor All a rest!!!!!\nI appreciate a pretty, shiny golf cart as much as the rest of hacking community...but don't spray it all over the cart...and don't spray it so it drips places where I will put my hands!!!!\nOnce the still wet Armor All gets on your hands, you are done golfing until you:\nA - get some solvent to get this crap out of all the little ridges and cracks in my hands...not good...it took 2 days, and;\nB - Get a good golf shop to re-grip ALL of your golf clubs to the tune of approx. $100\nYou cannot play golf if you can't hang onto the club and with Armor All on your hands, you literally (and I don't mean figuratively...I literally mean literally) cannot hold onto a golf club and swing it...it just won't be happening. I quit after 3 holes.\nNo satisfaction when I asked for a refund or some sort recompense (they did offer me a cart which wasn't dripping with Armor All, but the damage was done by then).\nI doubt I'll spend my golfing dollars there again."
2,"Taking a chill out on Chili's. My friend and I frequent this location usually once a month, occasionally more, & always sit in the bar area. Our favorite is the Presidente Margarita. YUM!!! This has become the staple of our visit and often times, the reason we choose Chili's. We were very excited to hear the margaritas were being featured on a dinner for two deal - perfect! Except that choices, well, kinda suck. The steak wasnt good, and since we dont get the combo. Upon our most recent visit, we both noticed that we were definitely shorted on our margaritas. Asked the server/bartender Jake, whom we've had before several times, if the recipe has changed and he swore it hadn't and said that it must have been that every single time before it was made incorrectly. He told us how he makes it and we reminded him that he's made our drinks for us on multiple occasions. The thing about Jake is that he is so super cheesy, he wouldn't admit it anyways. He should work with kids and families, not bar folk. We both felt insulted and disappointed that the margs we have to come to love so much can no longer fill our glasses two times. Not sure we'll be coming back. Def gonna take some time out to chill."
0,"I recently went there for lunch.  I was seated promptly, then forgotten about for a solid five minutes while other around me where taken care of by their servers.  They were seated after me.  When my server arrived I informed her that I felt forgotten.  Instead of apologizing, she blamed a large group as the cause of my delay.   Wrong.  It shows a systematic problem with their service training.  I will not be going back to this Chilis."
1,I'm not a fan.  Pretty average burrito.
2,"Better than average fresh-Mex food.\n\nI like their chips and salsa bar, but none of their salsas are phenomenal, just mediocre.  Their food is kinda bland and lacks flavor and their plates are a little on the small side..... not enough beans / rice.  Their prices are decent.  If you're thinking Chipotle or Rubio's or some crap like that, you'd be better off here, but that's not saying much."
3,"I was a little hesitant to try this place, as it hasn't really been reviewed well. However, I'm glad I trusted my gut (not the hungry part, the sensible part)!\n\nWhen I walked in, the dining room was absolutely packed! Obviously, it's a popular destination. So, I took a minute to see what looked best to me. After a few minutes perusing their menu, I opted for the Shrimp Burrito. The young lady behind the counter informed me that it would take about five minutes for my order to be ready. So, I took my drink to the dining room and waited.\n\nAs I was waiting, I passed by their full bar. I wasn't really in the market for an alcoholic beverage during lunch, so I didn't really price anything. The fact that this bar exists, though...that's the important thing! The self-serve chips and salsa bar was really cool! It's similar to ones that you would find at Baja Fresh, except for the endless chips. That's a pretty nice touch, in my opinion.\n\nAfter about five minutes (a touch longer, but I wasn't in a hurry), my burrito was ready. Size wise, my burrito was comparable to ones that you find at Chipotle or Qdoba. However, the difference maker for me was the actual content. I made sure to pay extra close attention to the amount of shrimp contained in my burrito. I've been burned at places before when they skimped on contents. Not here. EVERY single bite I took was accompanied by a full shrimp...and I don't take small bites. For $8.85, I was definitely impressed. \n\nIf you're in the market for a sort of change of pace with regards to your Mexican food, you should check out Blue Burrito Grille. If you need more incentive, they do have a couple of televisions, free Wi-Fi, and a nice patio. The patio is covered by umbrellas, but it doesn't have misters or anything like that. So, if you want to sit outside, make sure you get in on the action before it gets hot!"
3,"They have the best lunch specials here. For like six bucks you get a huge slice of pizza, huge side salad, and a drink. I think I am little overly enthused about this place because it was right next to my apartment in Flagstaff, but I really do think they have good pizza. My favorite pizza here is Fire in the Hole with garlic crust. You can also find a great variety of vegetarian pizza options as well as pizzas with alfredo sauce instead of marinara. \n\nNice restaurant for a date.\nCrazy Salads and Pizzas."
3,"I was in Scottsdale for business and got lost inside the ginormous circular/outdoor mall/shopping plaza that Picazzo was in while looking for something to eat for dinner. I know the signs outside say they have award winning lunch specials and I hoped that extended into dinner, of course. \n\nFirst of all, $18 for a medium pizza (6 slices)!?!?! Damn. I figured it must be fantastic, and I thought ... what the hell. I got the Bourbon Street Pizza. It smelled awful the whole drive back to my hotel. So pungent and fowl, I immediately regretted my decision. Sure enough, 5 minutes later, it was one of the best tasting pizzas I've put in my mouth (deja vu for me). Credit goes out to the hand-tossed dough, and the quality of the ingredients. I liked it so much I went back two days later to get a Pesto Margerita pizza. It was just ok. For a fancy pizza, it was better than a chain pizzaria (sp?) could make it, but not as good as before. They did, however, make an Awshm tortilla enchilada soup, and their bread is great. \n\nI give them four stars because I don't live here, and the novelty of eating fancy schmancy pizza that's not called california pizza kitchen (I live in LA) was, well, a bit of a novelty. There were so many items on the menu I wanted to try that I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, even though their pizza is ridiculously expensive and smells awful (both time, what are the odds?). Still, tastes great."
0,"Looks like I'm going along with the crowd on this one. Ate at the Frank Lloyd Wright location yesterday, and that will be the last time they see my smiling face walk through their doors.\n\nThe service was awful, and started when the waitress who sat us gave us the \""Oh lord, you have a CHILD???\"" She actually told us to enjoy our meal, unfortunately she was already 10 feet away with her back to us when she said it. Wow...never felt that welcome before!\n\nThe food (a small thin crust shrimp scampi pizza, a child's cheese pizza and a salad with chicken) took forever. And when it finally arrived, it was a whole lot less than satisfying.\n\nThe salad was bland, with two pieces of chicken and 12 tons of lettuce. The child's pizza was okay, but how can you screw that one up, right? The scampi pizza was another story entirely.\n\nWhen you order a $15.00 pizza, you expect to maybe have a couple slices left over for tomorrow's lunch, right? Not at ol' Picazzo's! Here's a pic of the pathetic pie. FIFTEEN DOLLARS, ladies and gentlemen. That's $1 per shrimp! What a bargain!!\n\nI've had microwave pizzas you cook on that little gray paper box that were tastier and crisper. Soggy...bland....tiny....nothing redeeming whatsoever.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back to Pizza Peeweecazzo. Ugh."
2,"Lunchtime on a Friday. \n\nSeated quickly , greeted well even though we're in the cube-dweller class. It looked like a summer dress was part of the dress code\n\nThe baked spicy chipotle wings were rather enjoyable though most of them could have used  some time in the gym to build a bit of muscle, not greasy and hot enough to be interesting. \n\nThe entree was chicken & chorizo pasta from the gluten free menu and while it really really looked the part  the only two ingredients that had any real taste were the artichoke and the roasted peppers. Seriously organic, oops, cilantro should be a little more present but it just didn't work well as a meal, as a photograph I assure you it would have rocked.\n\n I tried a piece of my coworkers gf free pizza and that was definitely the best base  of it's type I've had in Phoenix but that's a really relative term:.\n\nThe value is not there.Prefixing everything with organic is redundant and probably adds 1/3 to the menu's size:)  Nearly beats Flo's out for lunchtime noise the main area is pretty harsh and reflective  and regardless of what it looks like  it feels like mall food court.   I can't see  the need to pay $25 at lunch for OK being a regular occurence,"
0,Biggest rip off ever!! I had gotten an estimate from them to do a brake service and replacement on my vehicle and after my jaw dropped from the extravagant price they called me to reduce the original estimate they had given me by three thousand dollars!!!! Do they think I am an idiot!!! I will never do and business with this dealership. I will surely not ever buy an overpriced car from them either.
3,I've been for lunch half a dozen times and usually sit at the bar.  Their beers are great.  I'm a home brewer and am pretty discerning in my beer tastes.  Their HopKnot IPA has a huge nose of hops if you are a hop lover--which I am.  However the 8th Street Pale is probably my favorite.  It is a great balanced English style pale ale--without the bitter edge of an American pale ale like SN.  On a hot day their Kolsch is super refreshing and reminds me of being in Germany.  I've had mostly burgers and fries there and they are good.  The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive.  If you are a craft beer lover it is a nice laid back destination to enjoy a brew...or two.  They also pour growlers and sell cans of Kolsch and Kiltlifter in 12 packs.
2,"My wife and I stopped by last weekend to watch football and sample a couple of their brews.  The food was great could be some of the best french fries I've ever had.  The beer was good.  Noticed almost everyone drinking the house beers so it was nice to see that kind of support for an established micro brew.  There was a large crowd for football many folks wearing jerseys and everyone really getting into their game.  If your looking for an energetic place to watch football and grab a good bite this would be a place to consider.\n\nUPDATED 04/05/2012 lowered to 3 stars.\n\nI have been here a couple times since my first review and it really is just an average place.  The fries are the highlight.  The place is small, loud and well your AVERAGE pub or brewery."
0,"I just got back from from lunch at the Scottsdale location. My girlfriend and I have had questionable service there before, and had previously said that we were not going to again visit the establishment. But today, all I wanted was to have a sunbru, relax and eat. The hostess sat us down, which to me, it seemed like we were inconveniencing her conversation with the bus boy. Then, it seriously took the server 5 minutes to come to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink. I had to ask her to bring us glasses of water. I wanted to walk out, but my girl insisted we stay now that we were there. The server was attentive and pleasant, and I began to relax. Then i noticed the hostess, walk behind the bar with her pepsi cup, grab a bottle of whiskey, and continue to pour herself a drink. This seriously fired me up. It seems I have more pride in the brand than she does. I have been a patron of Four Peaks since I moved to AZ 11 years ago. I've had parties at the Tempe location, friends of mine have had baby showers there, and it bums me out to see how drastically things have changed. I support LOCAL as much as possible, but today's episode only serves me to explore my other options..I'll be heading to Chandler to check out SAN TAN Brewery or I will go Nimbus Bistro..bums me out!"
4,"Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!"
4,"I've been to the Four Peaks in Tempe a couple of times and its always been good. The Four Peaks in Scottsdale is just as great. I'm a foodie and a 20+ year restaurant veteran.  If I say something is good then it is. \n\nWalked right in. I love the second floor overlooking the main floor. I know many come here for the beer as that is what it's famous for, but the food is its own reason to come visit. \n\nMy eyes are bigger than my stomach as usual but in order what I want Ben if I can't eat it all. Today I felt like chicken rolls and nachos. The nachos by themselves will feed a family of four. I add chicken to the mountain of cheese and chips. All the salsa, sour cream, and other fixins come on the side so you don't have to worry about pleasing that pain in the ass friend who doesn't like something. \n\nThe chicken rolls deserve their own paragraph as they are hands down my favorite app here. Jen thought they were bland so I made her go sit in the truck. Just kidding. She wasn't impressed is what she said. Ce la vie. They are delicious. She also had the buffalo chicken soup which I had not had before and received an audible \""WOW\"" and an eyebrow lift from me. It was damn good too. \n\nMain course for me, no surprise, was a bacon cheeseburger with pepper jack and she had hot wings. Burger was cooked perfect and the seasoned fries were tasty as well. Her wings were good, not the best in the world, but on a scale to ten prob five them a 7 at least. \n\nService was great from Erica. Drinks never emptied and anything we needed we received promptly. Jen commented on the ambience and the nice spread of TVs around the place. Great place to come and watch sports or what not. Overall really really great experience."
3,"This place is always consistently good.  They obviously have a great beer selection on tap, but the food is also very good.  The jalapeno popper burger is awesome and something I've never seen anywhere else.  Service is always friendly and efficient.\n\nAnd of course, you can get six-packs to go."
2,"I can get Four Peaks at any bar nowadays, so the restaurant needs to have something unique to grab my attention. There's burgers, pizza, fish & chips...just about everything you would expect a bar to have, and certainly isn't adventurous. There's no dish in particular that calls out to me. \n\nWhat DOES call out to me, however, are the seasonal beers. Odelay? I've seen it elsewhere, but it's rare. There were some other small-batch brews that are apparently exclusive to Four Peaks locations. As I used a couple pints to wash down a dry, mediocre meal, I realized what my problem was. The beer is such a reliable selling point, it doesn't seem like anyone arranging the menu really tries. This is the southwest. This is a brewery known for taking risks with novel flavors. The menu should reflect that more, and not just coast on mediocre grub. Fries were rock hard. Burger was ok. \n\nOverall, our servers were so chill I enjoyed my lunch here. And the guy who had shown my friend and I the list of upcoming brews was very upbeat and passionate about what this company does. I wouldn't come here for dinner, but I'd definitely come to have a couple pints and catch a game."
3,If you get the 1/2 size Nacos it is the perfect amount. Not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person... then again it is a brewery. I am just unable to drink beer due to allergies. So some more drink specials would be appreciated.
3,"Decent spot, about what you would expect from a brew-pub.  This was my first time trying Four Peaks beers and I thought they were ok.  The food was your typical pub far, but much better quality.  The hummus stood out.  Would definitely return if in the area."
4,"Hands down the blackened chicken nachos are the world's best nachos! I have had nachos at literally hundreds of places and have never had better..fresh salsa, real cheese, fresh jalapenos, great blackened chicken, multi colored chips..no microwave  and generous portion...The best!"
0,"They microwave the eggs and meat and didn't have any bagels at left at 9am.  Won't be returning, though the service was ok."
2,"So, this is one of my favorite breakfast plates..the Ham and Brie Frittata, my way. I ask that they cut the brie by half and double the apples and leeks. Nine grain toast with butter and Black Cherry jam and it comes with a side of roasted rosemary potatoes.\n\nWhy just three stars? Well, here's the thing at this location. Up until yesterday when I got stellar service, the service has always been mediocre enough that I would crave this particular favorite and then hesitate because I wasn't sure if it was worth the aggravation (I am totally anal about good customer service, to the point of rudeness). If every time I was in it was yesterday's experience, then 5 stars all the way.\n\nHas management changed, perhaps? Service was near perfect, everyone was cheery and my meal was error free. Great JOB!\n\nIf yelp allows revising of reviews, then I will certainly revisit this in a month or two if I see that this is the new constant as opposed to a fluke. Food's very good, though, so gotta give it a Thumbs Up for that ;-D"
4,"We went in again and this time on what I have to consider one of their busiest times, Sunday mid morning for brunch. The service was fast and flawless!\n\nWildflower and Louis you convinced me! 5 stars!"
3,"After sampling their tasty roast beef and Gorgonzola mashed potatoes in a champagne glass at Yelp in Bloom I HAD to have this for lunch the next day. I woke up the following morning craving it and immediately looked up their menu online. I found the braised beef sandwich and called in my order. The quoted my 15 minutes, but I got there in less than 10 and it was ready. You can pick up call in orders at the first register when you walk right in. So convenient. They also have seating right outside on the sidewalk, but it's not covered so there isn't much shade around during the lunch hour. \n\nIt was everything I remembered. Whoever thought of putting mashed potatoes in a sandwich was brilliant. The sandwich comes with roast beef with Gorgonzola mashed potatoes and you get a side of horseradish and au jus on the side. It also comes with sweet potato chips. \n\nWell done, Wildflower. Well done. I was never much of a fan of yours before, but this one is a winner."
4,"If you believe bread makes a great sandwich, you will want to check out this place. I had the sausage and egg sandwich on 9 grain toasted. You could taste the fresh ingredients that all worked together beautifully. I will be back."
2,"Wildflower as a whole is a fantastic chain. I've never had a bad experience with anything the chain itself has control over. \n\nHowever, there are some things that, while not completely in Wildflowers control, only seem to have happened in this specific location. It's in the middle of a set of stores all nicely lined up... in a corner with a small parking lot for that specific section. This means that the parking lot is not so fun to navigate.\n\nI feel bad stating this as it is completely out of Wildflowers hands but is still relevant to whether you should pick this location or not. If you get there early or at specific times of the day, it's quite nice and not a problem - unless it gets packed while you're inside, then it's a pain to get out. However, if it's a busy time, then be ready to not only have a hard time finding seats inside, but in finding parking as well. I actually have had it happen a few times where I got stuck waiting behind someone in the parking lot who's waiting for that one spot that's a few feet closer than the other three spots that are rapidly being taken by other cars, but because the parking lot was so narrow I couldn't get around the car. \n\nThe inside gets packed as well, but even when it's slower and only has a medium amount of customers, it still has limited seating. This means that sometimes you are there with your family and need a larger area for them, but you can only quietly groan as you see anywhere that would be comfortable is taken and that quite a few of the bigger places to sit are occupied by just one person playing on their cell phone. As I've not worked for Wildflower nor known anyone who has, I don't know what the regulations are for instances like that, especially in today's age where common courtesy is rare and when a customers review/rating rule more than actual productivity of the place - so asking someone to move might could actually hurt the restaurant-  but it's pretty annoying that this happens and it happens a lot at this specific location. \n\nBasically, Wildflower is a fantastic restaurant. Their bread is fantastic, their soups are wonderful as well, and I really enjoy some of their salads. The restaurant itself is great. However, there ARE better placed locations that have better parking for your car and have better seating inside (so better parking for your rear too). I wouldn't say don't come here as the service is pretty decent (not fantastic but not bad in any way), but that if you can go to another location without it being inconvenient then I'd recommend it."
4,I love Wildflower and frequently visit. My favorite thing on the menu is the seasonal Tuscan Kale salad! \n\nThis location gets very busy for lunch so I call ahead and my food is always ready for me when I arrive.
4,Everyone here is wonderful.  Make no mistake this is no nationwide vision or Lenscrafters.  The doctors hear are very knowledgeable and down to earth.  I drive 45 minutes to go here.
3,"You would think this place is actually in Mexico given how long I had been meaning to try it.  I can only say, I should have gone sooner.  Really good Mexican food-not the touristy crap or the Scottsdaled up version.  I tried the green chile and loved it.   Decor is nothing to write home about, but not a complete dive either.  Service was excellent.\n\nI actually didn't find it all that cheap considering it's basic Mexican food, but I guess it's cheap for Scottsdale.  Dinners run about $12 on average.  Lunch about $7.  They also have breakfast.  On the bad side, they apparently have a lunch buffet.  God only knows how big my ass will get knowing that tidbit of information.  Five dollar a gallon gas may actually be a good thing."
2,"Came here because Oregano's was packed on a Saturday night.  I wonder how many of their customers are in the same boat.  I was initially craving Mexican food anyway, so I didn't care.  \n\nThe service is awesome, the beer was so cold it was almost icy (read: awesome) and the salsa is yummy yummy.  I ordered the specialty chimichanga and my mom got rolled tacos.  The plates were hu-hu-hu-huge.  And can I just say that cream cheese makes everything better, especially chimichangas.  YUM.  \n\nNot the best Mexican joint I have ever been to, but definitely decent enough to visit again (for the locals)."
3,"Exellant food! Inexpensive lunch buffet ( like 8.95). Friendly staff. Best beans and rice anywhere! Not much more to ask for. Food portions are inconsistant, I think it depends on who's cooking."
1,So the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though I ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco I informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if I wanted a side of beef.  I will not be back
3,"I realized on New Year's Eve that I had done some terrible planning on my part and may not be able to get in to get a mani/pedi before my trip to Mexico due to most places being closed on New Year's Day.  I woke up early and headed to the closest place to where I was house sitting in hopes to beat the New Year's Eve rush.  I was able to get right in here at Paulene's.  Hannah was very friendly and did a great job.  My pedi is just now starting to look as though it needs freshening up (2 weeks have passed).  My mani started to go after a week, but I also spent a lot of time in the ocean during that week.  My only issue with this salon is that you cannot add a tip on if you are using your credit card.  I never carry cash and always use my check card.  I had to head to the atm afterward to get cash for Hannah.  I wonder how many people just end up not tipping because of this.  Be sure to bring cash before you go.  My basic mani/pedi was $40 before tip."
2,"This place is really not too shabby! I almost feel bad only giving 3 stars, but it's nothing to write home about. It's just terribly convenient, given that I work next door.\n\nThe staff is friendly. They've got ginormous breakfast croissants. They have spicy ramen noodles which are actually very tasty, and they actually manage to make them a bit spicy! Bundle that all up and add a bow of very decent prices, and I call this place a win. I've been finding myself there a good few times recently. Matter of fact, just yesterday I had both lunch and breakfast over there!"
0,"I contacted the Closet Factory last Monday to arrange for a new master closet design. I spoke to the owner, Abby.  She indicated she would have a designer contact me.  By Sunday with no contact, I left a message which prompted a call back from Abby today.  She informed me that it would take another week for a designer to get back to me, that they are scheduling installs the week prior to my completion date which means if I wait another week for a call then I couldn't make my completion, and if I want any hard wood it would take 5 to 6 weeks.  I asked if my only option was to wait for the one designer who has my \""territory\"" and she said yes.  I guess she must be doing very well to turn away business."
3,"Came here to watch the special screening of Phoenix lights, but the tickets sold out! Ended up watching 300, rise of the empire and the theater it was playing in was just so small! The sound was really good. Theater 11 was the theater the movie was in. It kind of reminded me of a small classroom in college with a power point presentation at the front of the room, haha. The staff was friendly though and it was a very clean theater, with the heavenly smell of freshly popped popcorn permeating throughout the theater"
0,"The owner is the only one with any talent and you need to catch her on a good day. I went to this place a total of 5 times. I got 1 good haircut from the owner and the next two that she did were nowhere near as good.  I even had to fix an obviously too long piece that did not fit with the rest of my bangs. I switched to another girl who did a not great job the first time and I went back thinking she just needed to get to know my hair. HA! The second time she not only slaughtered the haircut but really did a terrible color. Number one lesson girls, don't cut a person's hair too short on top if it's fine, especially fine and curly.  I did complain especially about the color and she put a glosser on it that made the \""caramel\"" (read brassy yellow) highlights look less like a peroxide bottle exploded in my direction, for a few shampoos, but eventually it faded back to that horrible color job and seriously dried out my hair. \n I haven't been back to this place in a while but I still remember how ugly I felt for months and months after that last horrible cut and color.  I saw that I had never posted this review from a while back so I went ahead and posted it now. It deserves to be posted when I still feel like crying just reading my old draft of a review. \n This place is seriously not worth $200+  The skill of the hairdressers is on par with a JC Penney salon- new hire!"
3,"One of the best public courses in North Scottsdale. It very family friendly and they are used to having young junior golfers on the course. I find the course to be in very good condition whenever we are there. The staff in the pro shop are always pleasant and helpful. The snack bar could be better. It has a very limited selection and it is a little hidden. I doubt most golfers even know that there is one there. Usually we end up going to the restaurant instead, which is great, but does not have a very good kids menu. It would be nice if they had a more elaborate selection at the snack bar for quick and cheap grab and go food."
3,"Forget the tablecloth-and-white-glove joints. I walked in and could not believe the selection on the menu, but was even more impressed with the healthy options available. I had an omelet and wheat toast, and the portion was enough to carry me from 9am to 3pm - and I'm not a small guy."
0,"If you are looking for a nice, stressfree getaway, I warn you not to stay at the Four Seasons Scottdale. The hospitality, communication skills (or lack their of) are by far the worst I've experienced in all of my travels. As I will get into details once I've checked into my next destination, i warn you at all costs not to stay at this hotel. It is by far the worst (what they call) luxury hotel experience."
0,"Since we received a canned response here on Yelp, we contacted corporate who were appalled at the situation and lack of follow-up by the management in Scottsdale. They apologized profusely and were deeply disgusted about the chimneys being lit on patios, especially around young children. They offered a partial refund,"
1,"Not what i expect from a four seasons. The rooms are nice and comfortable but there were so many small things that made this stay pretty uninspiring for the $. We stayed here for a wedding and the ceremony outside was wonderful but then the reception started. The  four seasons offered 3 small apps that were actually awful tasting. Most venues offer large buffets at no extra charge to the Bride and Groom. The sausage with a small blob of cheese and chicken on a stick paired with a piece of pineapple  was something I would expect from a high school cafeteria app platter. Then there was dinner, they messed up our table and we were two seats short so my husband and I were crammed into our table that was not meant for the amout of people that were supposed to be seated there. Not a bad frozen fruit in a cup was served at first followed with a basic salad then a tapas sized meat on potatoes with no side veggies. I was starving at this point and dinner was finished. Water glasses were never refilled and it seemed none of the servers were in a good mood. Everyone at the table was still hungry after dinner so it wasn't just me. I've never been so hungry for cake in all my life and I don't even really crave cake. Coffee was served a half hour before cake and not offered again during cake time. Overall I was expecting decadent food and fantastic service where your glass would never be empty but that just was not the case. Then we get back to the hotel where you hike to get to your room otherwise you stand waiting for some guy in a golf cart to pick you up. The room key stopped working and they ask you to sign in to the wi fi about 6 times in two days. for the money I would say go elsewhere if you can."
4,"Love scottsdale quarter and this store by far has the best semi annual sale selection. Organized, clean and I got wall flowers for $2 refills what a huge reflection will be back! A great asset to the shopping center!"
4,Very friendly staff. Store smells awesome. Wife loves it. Do I need to say more?
2,"We have used Target Optical on and off over the years depending upon our insurance coverage. In the beginning, I was very skeptical about using a eye doctor in a clothing/food retailer but in the end they won me over with their service and prices. Nice job!"
2,"I guess you have to try it at least once to say you did.\n\nWe had the sweetest lady for our server, so the service was excellent.\n\nThe food was your typical cowboy fare...not bad, not great.  \n\nThe entertainment was heee-larious.  I felt like I should've worn a ten-gallon hat.\n\nIt's tourist-y, for sure :o)"
2,"Hadn't been here in years.   Came back recently with a large group for a business meeting.  The food was simple, steak, chicken and a baked potato.  The salad was your salad from a bag dressed with store bought raspberry dressing.  The chicken was standard, but the steak was surprisingly well done.  I've got to say since the kitchen was churning out steaks for 150 people, that is impressive.\nThe verde bar was kept busy by all the thirsty folks and the margaritas were tasty.  They have a full liquor bar and that was emptied pretty quickly. We had a cute show emceed by a guy who looked the part of a grizzled, slightly off kilter miner.  The show really is the reason why you come here.  Its a cute place to take out of towners, as a person who lives in Phoenix, I won't be making the drive regularly out here, but the place looks like a movie set and it's still closer than driving to Old Tucson :)"
0,"The food is very mediocre.  The step down out the front door needs to be addressed.  My wife was carrying my 2 year old daughter  and they both fell and landed pretty badly.  The floor drops down about 6 inches right outside the door.  Needless to say my daughter hit her head on the concrete and sustained quite a bump.  The manager got us some ice and a towel, but I would have liked a little more assistance and verification that we were going to be ok.\n\nIt's troubling that our society is so sue happy, that it's the first thing the restaurant thinks of and tries to distance themselves from the situation and fails to respond in a decent manner.\n\nFix your front door!  You have it painted so you realize it's an issue.  A few bags of concrete and some labor and your entry can actually be safe!\n\nIf you are in the area Greasewood Flats is a much better choice!"
2,"Hadn't been here in years!  The views are fabulous and the band was great.  Beer was cold, food was really over priced!  Lower your prices and improve the service, please."
0,"Danger, Will Robinson! The Good Egg does not at all serve *good* eggs ... they are PROCESSED!\n\nWhen the bill for our food arrived, the restaurant charged a dollar extra for an omelette to be prepared only with egg whites. I asked why. \""Because it's more expensive for us,\"" said the server.\n\n\""How can removing the yolk be more expensive? Aren't you paying for the same egg either way?\""\n\n\""Unless you order an actual fried egg, all of our egg dishes are prepared with a mix.\""\n\n\""What do you mean, 'a mix?'\""\n\n\""We buy pre-mixed eggs in a carton.\""\n\nWhat in the WORLD!? \n\nIt turns out that even if my aunt had ordered her omelette with the yolks (read: normally) it still would have been made from a processed egg product, manufactured in some unknown location by an unknown corporate agri-business conglomerate.\n\nThe menu does not disclose any of this. If it did, business would drop like a rock.\n\nThe manager corroborated the server, that egg-whites only actually cost their company MORE money than if they cracked open fresh eggs themselves. \n\nFirst, why would a company named The *Good* Egg use anything but actual and real eggs in ANY dish? (Whatever processed egg-ish product they are using certainly includes preservatives and God knows what else.) Second, if their processed egg product is indeed more costly, why is it their preference? As a business person, I will say out loud right here and now that the people in the restaurant are mistaken ... if the oh-so-important egg-ish stuff The Not-So-Good Egg pours on a fry griddle is so damned excellent then, well, the truth is that the only reason for this strictly business decision is that the product costs less, not more.\n\nMy family has been a customer of this chain - and this specific restaurant - for 15 years, and this not-fresh egg issue came as news to us. \n\nWe were not offered a discount when paying for our four meals. The server and manager both told us that next time we are in we will know to ask for our dishes to be prepared with actual eggs. There will not be a next time."
2,They took my favorite items off their menu but the food is still good. We sat on the patio where many birds picked food off plates. I found it interesting to watch but others found it unnerving having birds dive bomb you while you eat. The staff definitely needs to be instructed to remove plates more quickly. The birds swarm a table when people leave.
4,"We have been eating at Sesame Inn since we moved here six months ago.  We do not eat meat and are so happy with the tofu offerings.  We particularly like the Spicy Thai Basil Tofu.  Hearty, spicy, vegetables that are al dente and the tofu is cooked just right.  The service is always excellent. Food is always hot off the stove and consistent in its preparation.  We are \""regulars\"" now."
3,"I really like this grocery store. The produce is usually fresh and they usually have everything I need in stock. \n\nIt's a no thrills grocery store...meaning there's no starbucks inside...no bar...no gelato...no sushi...it's just groceries. There is a Chase bank, which is kinda hidden. I like the fact that there aren't any thrills because I think it keeps their prices low. Also, if you spend $100, you get 10 cents off per gallon at participating Shell and Circle K stations."
3,"Very nice place to stay.  Came here with my family as part of a vacation package - we chose the king bed room with pull-out couch for the three of us and so far has not been a hassle.  Love the fact that there is a gas fireplace in the room and a jacuzzi tub.  If it warms up a bit we might venture to the pool and/or hot tub.  Fry's is just up the street and we are buying much of our food and supplies there - the room has a fridge and coffee maker, but no microwave.  \n\nOur neighbors are active but it hasn't been too much of a problem.   The walls are a bit thin but it's to be expected.  Where we are is handi-accessible and I definitely recommend this for those who are limited in their mobility - it has lots of handrails in the bathroom, and has a shower chair.\n\nNice big closet and dresser - loved the fact that they supply two spa robes.  This is a nice place and very low-stress.  The front desk people were exceptionally nice and very helpful in telling us of nearby restaurants.\n\nLastly, the southwestern style is of the room adds to the relaxed atmosphere of the place.  The artwork in the room is similarly southwestern-themed, so it's cheesy but in a good way!\n\nWill definitely stay here again if the chance comes up again :)"
3,"I live nearby and really like this place. They make their bagels fresh every morning and they make their own cream cheese. I like my everything bagel with the nova cream cheese. Yummy!  They get busy on the weekends very early and once they're out of something, they're out. They always have a lot of everything but I've been there later in the morning on a Saturday and they were out of a certain kind of bagel.  Sooooo good!!!"
1,I don't know how this place is busy.. Every time I go its day old bagels at best last time I had about 2 bits and trashed the rest of it.. I also tried the breakfast sand.. it was interesting to say least bagel was hard had about a bite of it then trashed it. I deffently dont plan on coming back. Service is friendly thats why I am giving 2 stars and a stretch however food is lacking.
3,"When we pulled up to the Senor Taco in Fountain Hills, located in a run-down strip mall behind a Circle K, the 1st thing I noticed was the trucks.  The parking lot (what there is of it) was full of big trucks with construction looking tools and equipment on the backs.  I thought, \""this is a good sign.\""\n\nThe restaurant has gone through an interior upgrade, so the formica booths and tile floors are clean, but not much more.  You walk to the cashier and place your order (or use the drive thru).  It comes up in about 5 minutes.  The prices cannot be beat.  We ordered the fish taco plate and got two huge tacos in fresh corn tortillas with cabbage and fresh crema.  The rice and beans are awesome but never quite hot enough (that's why they only get 4 *).   My husband and I can get ONE platter and split it all for $6.99.  The prices on everything are reasonable and the flavors are authentic.  The folks that eat here know their mexican food.\n\nThey have a self serve salsa bar with your usual salsas, and my favorite, pickled carrots and fresh radishes.  Yum.   It aint fancy, but it's cheap, quick and delish."
1,"The food here is definitely subpar.  I ordered a hard shell shredded chicken taco, and it was unappealing.  It had no flavor, and the shells were soggy.  The chicken was flavored with salsa, but it tasted like it was flavored with some cheap tomato sauce. The rice and beans were unremarkable as well.  The only good thing about the meal were the chips.\n   Unbelievable to me how the Phoenix area is lacking in decent Mexican restaurants.  With such a large Hispanic population, I would think there would be a better selection."
2,"Since it was COLD on Friday, my wife and I decided to go to Chen's for lunch. I don't know why we didn't think of Pei Wei but this restaurant is much closer to our house. \nMy wife ordered the Chicken Rice Bowl and I ordered the Chicken with Rice Noodles off the Lunch menu. It came with egg flower soup which was nice an hot. When my meal came, I can't figure out why they would give me fried rice with noodles...double the starch. I really enjoyed it. The egg roll was made with just vegetables...so, so. But I didn't like the fried Won Ton which was crispy on the outside but REALLY dry on the inside. Can't complain for two hot meals under $10."
0,"I don't write reviews, but I had to so that people would know this place is NOT a 4 star worthy Chinese restaurant."
3,"We really enjoyed our dinner at the Euro Pizza Cafe. We went on a Wednesday night. It was very busy on the patio, but we had no problem getting a table with a perfect view of the Fountain. There was a guitarist and vocalist on the Grapeables patio next door, so we even had some music to add to the ambiance. \n\nOur waitress was very nice and accommodating. \nWe started off with the Hummus appetizer and Garlic Knots.\nThe Hummus was awesome. It had a little kick because of the cayenne pepper, but not too much. It was a little thick and gritty, which I can get into sometimes.  It was served with pizza dough that had been grilled and sliced like pita. Incredible. I really can't say enough about how amazing this appetizer was. I highly reccommend it. \n\nThe garlic knots were delicious as well. The sauce that they serve to dip them in was so good that I could eat it with a spoon, and I don't do that sort of thing!\n\nFor dinner I got a simple greek salad, which was ok- nothing exciting. I would probably skip the salad next time and get something else off the appetizer menu and really gorge myself.\n\nThe rest of my party ordered a cheese pizza and really enjoyed it. My mother and husband split an order of meatballs as well, and they raved about how amazing they were. Moist and flavorable.\n\nWe are excited to go back to the Euro Pizza Cafe soon!"
3,"Came here after playing some disc golf...This place has the best calzones!!!  Their pizza is good also, but gotta go for the calzones!  You really get your monies worth for $8.  Their draft rootbeer is good, but you could taste a bit of a beer aftertaste.  Love the scenery with outdoor seating...looking at the fountain and green landscaping is so relaxing!"
3,"I came here on a Friday night around 7:30pm, wasn't too crowded. I ordered the clam linguine and it was delicious, not to mention the generous number of clams in the dish. The white wine sauce was light, yet flavorful. Portion was definitely plentiful, I even had enough for 2 small meals the following day! \n\nService was fantastic. The waitress came by enough to be attentive, but not hovering. It's so rare to see service with a smile and pure genuineness in light conversation. \n\n Prices were fair. Parking is plentiful. Next time I'm around the area, I'll surely stop by!"
2,nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.
2,"The majority of reviews pan this simple, Italian restaurant.  While they definitely could use some training in how to cook pasta al dente, there is some great construction of dishes and flavors going on.  PLEASE serve warm bread and olive oil!!   The veal was cooked well, the meatballs dense and flavorful. The tiramisu was one of the best I have ever eaten! The service was sweet and personal. Still guys, overcooked pasta will leave most patrons not wanting to return even if the sauce on top is tasty"
1,Good on the usual suspects but other than that don't get too crazy on the others.    Service not good
0,My daughter and I ate sushi there last Friday night and came down with a terrible case of salmonella food poisoning!!!  This place needs to close ASAP!!!\n\nYOU risk your life if you EAT THERE!!!  BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"It was 11:30am and my wife was out with the girls for lunch and I was craving a nice greasy McDonald's hamburger and fries. This McDonalds was on my way home from a meeting and was the perfect place to fulfill my gastric cravings.\nAt the drive through I ordered a quarter pounder with cheese meal. I live about 5 minutes from the McDonalds and my mouth was watering all the way home. Got home and unpacked my goody bag. I took one bite of the hamburger expecting my cravings to be answered. Well...the bun was HARD, the burger DRY and the fries were like dry straw! At least the diet coke was as advertised! \nI landed up throwing it all in the trash and eating a leftover salad from the fridge. \nThe quality control at that McDonald's is horrible and I will never go back there again and would tell others to do the same for take out. Eat in, you can always go back to the counter and get a freshly made replacement."
4,We just finished a kitchen cabinet remodel and couldn't be more happy. Working with David and his sub contractors couldn't have gone any smoother.  Whenever David said he would be at our home he was there right on time as were the other sub contractors. All calls were returned promptly. These are things you would expect but usually don't occur. ...as to the job David ideas and attention to detail  and execution were terrific. Additionally the remodel was fairly priced and completed on time. Our kitchen look fantastic and we would definitely recommend his company.\n\nPete and Jane Gruber
0,Will never go to this place again.  Gross is an understatement.  Had to send my dish back as it made McDonalds look good.  Strange atmosphere.  Don't reallyfeel like going on about this place as it sucked.  Just don't go.
1,"Couple days ago I visited a Streets of New York. My friend was driving and we were drinking so I may be confused, but I am pretty sure this is the one.  We had a tiny server named Carly?  Is this the right one?  Anyways, it was a big mistake.  My server looked like she may have been seventeen --while wearing makeup--and she acted even younger.  The personality that she wore at our table seemed to quickly dissolve when she exchanged words with members of the staff and I overheard countless inappropriate remarks made by her.  In addition to the unprofessional nature of our server, our food (which was mediocre) was apparently messed up by the kitchen (=server error), the tables were sticky and disgusting, and I walked out less satisfied than when I walked in.  \ntwo enthusiatic thumbs down"
2,"Out this Sunday morning doing a bit of GeoCaching, we decided breakfast was in order so where to go? I-Hop or Denny's ... Ok we decided on local so off to Denny's. Walked in, the place was about half full, greeted right away and seated. Coffee & water came out promptly, placed our order and our food arrived hot within about 5min. Service was great & food was good ...\n\nService: 4 star, our waitress was great, fast & friendly\nAmbiance: 2 stars, casual setting, a bit dated\nCleanliness:  3 stars, appeared clean although lots of water spots on the glasses\nFood: 3 star, food came out hot and well prepared\nPrice: 3 star, fair price's, my wife had a BYO Grand Slam for $6.59 and I had an All American Slam for $8.89"
2,"I happened to visit Manuel's yesterday for some lunch with some friends. I had never gone before, but thought I would give it a try.  Here's a very quick assessment of the place:\n\natmosphere: very 70s/80s - clearly the place has been here a while.\nservice: fair. nothing stellar, but not terrible either.\nfood: also fair, not great but not bad.\nprice: perhaps a bit overpriced for the quality, but not by much.\noverall experience: ok."
0,"Poor customer service. When I asked if they were able to check stock at another near location for a product they were out of, the lady threw up her hands and asked me if I knew where the next closest location was and simply told me \""I don't know\"". She then told me if I waited she MIGHT be able to look it up. So I waited and finally just left when i realized she had no intention of returning to help me as she decided to help another customer. It seemed to me that having 3 customers in the store was too much to handle for 2 employees.... Being that I just relocated from out of state, I've quickly learned this is not a place ill be returning to, regardless of its proximity to my house. I drove to the Mesa location and received 5 star customer service."
0,"Agree with earlier review from Greg except service was worse than poor and entree was hot, but sides were cold; obviously sat on plate waiting for entree. Restrooms are located in the hotel lobby, nowhere near restaurant; needed a tour guide to get there! Terrible experience!"
1,"Went to a day game on 3/27/10 against the SF Giants  Plenty of fans of both teams were in attendance.  I'd have to say this stadium was more like an old minor league ballpark - sparse, not a lot of fluff, needing some renovation, but sufficient to host baseball games for plenty of fans.  The grandeur of the signage on outside of the stadium belies the inside condition.\n\nParking was fairly easy, and only $5. Despite signs disallowing tailgating, there was plenty of that, including lots of people throwing balls in the parking lot where cars were moving around.  Parking lot staff did nothing to stop them.  On the other end of the lot we were in were the practice fields, and when we arrived the Angels were just finishing their batting practice so there was a huge crowd of people standing around at the far end of our lot..\n\nGoing in, we stood in one line and got all the way up to the ticket lady before finding out that they had a _separate_ line for tickets purchased on line, so had to move to the other side of all the intake lines, and  stand in line again to enter.  The lack of signage for that was annoying.  I must also say that the lady who checked my purse for contraband did the most thorough job of any purse-checking person I've ever seen.  She was in everything!\n\nWe had cheap bleacher seats just beyond first base for this game.  They were fine, but they were also in the sun for the whole game.  Didn't care for the fellow next to me constantly and loudly talking to his friends in our row and the row behind, but that's not the stadium's fault.  One funny thing was that it appeared that the players had to actually pass through the public portion of the stadium to get from the practice field to the game field, including coming across the concourse where the concession stands were, among the fans, and down the steps where the seats were in left field.  It presented a good opportunity for fans to ask for autographs, for sure, but somehow it struck me as weird.  That would never happen in a major league park.\n\nWe walked around the whoie stadium to see what they had, and were strangely unimpressed.  Food selection was fairly standard for stadiums, nothing special there.  My BF liked their beer selections.\n\nLeaving the game afterwards was really bad as traffic was only superficially directed by stadium staff and Tempe PD, both of whom seemed surprisingly confused on what needed to happen.  It took more than a half hour to drive the two blocks away from the stadium exit.  You'd think that after having four week of games there (and doing it for four years), they'd have figured it out better, esp. since they knew ahead of time that the game was sold out..\n\nI think we can put Tempe Diablo Stadium in the \""been there, done that\"" category now.  We had a good time, but probably won't move any mountains to go again for a few years."
4,"Not as fancy as the newer stadiums that have been built, but I come here to watch baseball not to be seen.\n\nThe Angels play here, so I'm a little biased and would love this place no matter what. I just love chillin out on the lawn with a pint of Mirror Pond and watching the minor league players try to prove themselves with a few All-Stars sprinkled in.\n\nThe atmosphere is great as Angels fans are awesome and show much love and class for the team.\n\nNote...park in the industrial lot across the way if you don't want to wait for hours to pay $5 and park a block closer."
1,"Compared to other spring training facilities and minor league ballparks, color me unimpressed. \n\nWhat is does have: \n- The outfield grass is the place to be. We roamed around to find the best spots and this seemed the most relaxing. Not too hot, and not too cold.\n- We liked the fact that the ushers didn't really care where you sit. If you wanted to sit behind home plate, nobody will stop you.\n- ample seating. Wasn't crowded when we went.\n- It's still spring training, which you can't bitch about.\n- easy parking.\n\nWhat it lacks:\n- Atmosphere! This place is quieter than a library! You could seriously hear a pin drop. Was it apathetic Angels fans? I don't know. But they only played music when there was a pitching change and even then it seemed like an afterthought. It was very surreal to go to a quiet game where nobody seemed to be really interested. I know it's spring training, but come on?\n- A decent view. You can see the freeway and a University of Phoenix building in right field. Whoop de doo! The left field had a cool view of a mesa however. \n- Decent food. It has ballpark fare and nothing else. It has nothing to write home about. The italian ice in the outfield was a welcome treat."
3,"Let me start off by saying...I looooooove a good pastrami sandwich.  So when a friend suggested of mine said he was going to make a lunch run down there, I checked out their menu and right away told him to bring me back a pastrami.  I must say...I made a excellent choice.  The sandwich was very good.  Plenty of pastrami and cheese.  The pickle spear was a unexpected and pleasant surprise.   So in closing, this review is completely based on just the sandwich, I haven't been inside the shop yet...but when I do get there...I'll update."
3,My friend lives right around the corner and after a little shopping we decided to stop in and grab some food. She ordered a turkey wrap and I got the turkey bacon melt. Both were made when we ordered it and were ready in about 3 minutes. Mine was perfectly hot and the flavor was excellent. Gotta show support for local business!!
0,"More like stress zone. I came here for my 19th birthday with my girlfriend in October,  we got facials and a 1 hr massage. Cost well over 300 dollars. We paid by credit card and they called us 3 hours later telling us it did not go through and threatened to call the cops! They probably thought I was dipping them...I apologized and went back immediately. Turns out they charged my card 2x!! I ended up getting my extra they took from me and no apology on their side. It's a very old building And the blankets are like hospital blankets but older. I will never come back here. Honestly, go to a four seasons hotel and it actually cost less with  a steam room and a beautiful built building. I will never ever ever come back here. Horrible experience for my birthday. Plus, now that I think of it they should have given me a special cause it was my birthday the day I went. I would give it zero stars if I could."
2,"It's what i've come to expect from WF, although this store felt a little cluttered. I hit up the salad bar which was varied, but not as extensive as other WF's. The cheese section was not very impressive. I may checkout the one in Chandler."
0,Juice bar does not wash the produce. I asked why and they said since its organic we don't wash it.. Be careful or insist that they wash the produce.. This is a health hazard and extremely dangerous for the elderly and children.
0,"I purchased a Groupon Coupon, called and made an appointment.  When I showed up, they did not have me in their appointment book.  I had a short wait until a stylist was ready for me.  I don't know if she was a meth addict, or had the DT's or Parkinsons.  Her hands shook terribly!  She was rough on my head, tossing it around while she washed my hair.  The  head massage lasted about 15 seconds.  She did not explain to me the French Hair Cutting technique so I thought she was really wacky when she asked me to stand during the cut.  The cut ended up to be fine, but the experience was not very good.  I still have a coupon to use so I will have another hair cut and a facial.  Hope the next experience is better."
1,So I decided to order food from them for lunch for myself and a coworker. The ordering was easy enough and I was told it would be here by 1215 ordered at 1140am... I though sure not a problem... It got here at 1230... After I called to ask what was taking so long. No apologies or nothing... If you say your going to be here at a specific time show up promptly! It's my lunch hour! It was shortened thanks to you and your employees who don't give a damn. 23 bucks for 2 half sandwiches and small salads after tip.. Shoulda ordered something good for this price. I got the turkey sandwich  and it was rather forgettable. I don't think I will be ordering from this establishment again. Shoulda just got in n out.
3,Try the lunch bagels!  The Northern exposure and Tempe turkey are excellent.  The chicken salad is really good too.  They aren't real expensive and the service is pretty good.  They also have outdoor seating.  They are new and as far as I can tell not a chain.  I recommend you try them.  Oh a dozen bagels are half priced after 2pm.
4,Amazing choices. Friendly staff.
1,"i am revising my review of back east and embarrassed to be duchess of this place. i first loved this place because of their vanilla half and half. that was until one day, when coming near closing time, i realized it was fat free vanilla coffeemate! their service continues to go downhill- how many times to i need to get attitude from someone before i decide that einstein's is actually better?  last time we went, they were out of ice and soda, yet my friend was sold a cold cup with no argument. we have changed our weekly bagel brekkie to bagel nosh- i'd rather drive to awahtukee and have someone be happy i'm dining at their restaurant and have decent sandwiches-other than the veggie sandwich, back east fails miserably,imo. i hope someone that works here and/or management reads this and realizes that they pretty much just lost 3 of their best customers.."
0,"These bagels are an absolute joke. Not sure what part of the east Coast this shop is from, but it's not NY. Walking in, most of the bins were pretty empty at 10am, but these are fool's bagels. They are the size of a bottlecap and the hole in the middle is triple the size of any real NY bagel. Must be students buying these imposters because one look at these bagels was all I needed as I quickly escaped this \""bagel\"" shop and headed for the hills. Embarrasing to have east coast on the marquee - I'm glad it doesn't say NY bagels at least."
4,"Who cares if its a chain?  As far as bang for your buck is concerned, Outback has always been good in my book.  It was a packed house when we got there, so we sat at the bar and Paige was our bartender and she was great.  She helped us get the table we wanted quickly and was very friendly.  Blake was our server and he was great as well.  Food was all very tasty.  Had bloomin onion, filet with wild mushroom sauce, and prime rib.  While the prime rib was a little tough in some places, it was still very good overall.  Good prices, good food."
1,"Outback Steakhouse\nMultiple Locations\n\nWith all the hype and advertising it was only natural to try Outback. It was a Tuesday night, and we were seated immediately. We chose not to have anything from the bar, and instead stayed non-alcoholic for the evening.\n\nCompanion #1 ordered a bowl of potato soup. It arrived hot, with nice chunky potatoes sticking out of the soup along with large pieces of bacon. No complaints were heard. Companion #2 ordered the Cesar Salad. It seemed run of the mill, and companion noted that it was a bit heavy handed on the cheese.\nI ordered the regular salad with the honey mustard vinaigrette. This was a nicely done salad.\n\nFor main courses, companion #1 ordered a medium bacon cheeseburger. The burger arrived medium but on the dry side, with barely adequate cheese and decent fries. Companion felt she had had better burgers in most fast food places.\nCompanion #2 ordered the rib eye steak medium rare. It arrived medium rare, but seemed to be poorly prepped in that it had lots of sinew on it, and the tail still had some silverskin attached. Seasoning was adequate but nothing special.\nI had the Ahi tuna appetizer along with the small sirlion. The Ahi was cooked correctly, but had been pre-cooked hours before, and was greatly over-seasoned. By the time you added the wasabi vinaigrette dipping sauce, the fish had no taste left of its own. In paying for a premium fish like Ahi, the fish should be the central character, and the rest of the condiments are the supporting role. The petite sirloin was cooked as ordered (rare), but lacked flavor and again, still had silverskin attached, making the last piece memorable for its chewiness.\n\nWe did not order any deserts.\n\nInspection of the restrooms was pleasant enough, in that they were recently cleaned, smelled fresh, and looked nice.\n\nOverall, I might rate Outback 2.5 to 3 stars. I've definitely had better at lower prices. BTW if you are tempted by the Blossom, their signature onion and your on a diet, companion #1 says stay far away from it. That one dish alone will use up the entire days amount of points!"
0,"I normally love Outback & I've NEVER written a review on a place, but this experience wasn't up to par & it was definitely a weird one... \n\nI went to Outback for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend. Twice it was mentioned that it was my birthday by someone in my party & not one time did they do the \""let us offer you birthday dessert!\"" thing... Which is totally fine, but they have always offered free birthday dessert any time I've been there with other parties & even if I wouldn't have taken it, it would've been nice to be consistent.\n\nFirst thing I ordered was a bloomin onion because I was starving & who doesn't love them?!? About an eighth of the way into it, I couldn't chew through whatever I was eating... I pull it out of my mouth & it looked like plastic! I'm not one to overreact so I just alerted the waiter & he asked if we wanted to continue eating it. Continue eating it?!? Whatever. My bf joked that he would try another piece to see if there was more plastic & he had the same type of texture to his piece. The waiter took it back & told us he would make another one & then proceeded to tell us that it wasn't plastic, but just that the skin of the onion wasn't cut off prior to making it. So they made us another one & I don't know if it was because I was already grossed out by the one before, or if they were off their game that night, but it didn't taste right either.  It was such a disappointment considering that's almost my favorite part of the whole place!\n\nSo onto entrees...\n\nI ordered a steak & sides & my bf ordered his steak medium rare. We get our food only to realize that the waiter had never asked me how I wanted my steak cooked & just cooked both of them medium rare; I told him that my meat looked like it was bleeding & I couldn't handle it. He was very nice & said he would take it back & put it into the grill for a little bit longer... I agreed that it just needed a tiny but as I wanted mine medium, but not bloody whatsoever. The manager comes back with my steak & is very apologetic & asks if it's up to standards. Just looking at the steak you could tell that the top had this hard layer over it as if it was burnt. I told him it was fine & he assured me he would make me another one, but at that point my bf had gotten his food & I didn't want to wait even longer for mine to get done as we had other birthday plans... So I cut into mine and it was just okay...not anything great as my previous steaks had been. I even had to cut off the charred part because it was like eating a burnt steak. Ugh. The manager was VERY nice, but at that point I just felt like nothing they did that night (food wise) was right & I was regretting even coming there for my birthday dinner. My BF (who is the King of loving his meat medium rare) had to send his back because he had to run to the bathroom to spit out a piece that he couldn't chew through! He got his steak back & it was overcooked as well... My steak was taken care of by the manager but the horrible bloomin onion wasn't & we were offered dessert, (not \""birthday dessert) but declined because I wasn't going to give them the chance to ruin that for me too.\n\nOverall, we will definitely not be back to this location again! The manager was extremely nice & so was the waiter, but the taste in my mouth that I had from the horrible plastic tasting bloomin onion (that I paid for) was enough to make me stick with the Chandler location."
1,This place isn't classy and has a Ross in it for crying out loud!! But...I am en love with Fredrick's of Hollywood!!! You won't find a Nordstrom in this mall.
2,It's ok. Prices or not cheaper than regular prices.
4,"An indoor mall that has it all! This is an air conditioned outlet mall filled with hundreds of shops and plenty for the kids to do. It is a mall you can spend all day at because there is so much going on. Let me start off by telling the ladies you must wear comfortable shoes because this mall is made for us. There are some bargains in each and every store. I use this mall as part of my  workout regimen because I get so many steps in one day. For the men don't feel left out there is plenty for you to see and do as well. I have found some great men stores along with athletic stores like Sports Authority. Now for young ones there is an Arcade, IMAX Theatre, Aquarium, Rain Forest Cafe, dozens of dining places  and so much more. Wonderful place to tke the family."
2,"Not the greatest mall in the valley, but also not the worst! Decent selection of outlet stores and an ok food court. They recently added an aquarium which I think will add to the appeal. It's a shame that they closed Gameworks."
3,There are a lot of good stores and deals here but I don't like to come here during peak hours.  This seems to be where all the teens and sketchy people hang out. It also gets very crowded as well.  Come in the mornings during the week if you can.\n\nPro: Good stores and deals\nCon: Sketchy shoppers
2,"Rivas is your typical authentic style mexican food eatery, although in comparison to the other local restaurants in its same category (Filiberto's, Nico's, Texano's) I believe it is head of its class. Rivas has a super burrito, which is more like the american idea of a burrito(Chipotle style) of putting everything, including rice and beans, inside the burrito. The one area it lacks in is the Pico De Gallo, it seems to repeatedly have too much onion and cilantro in it.  Aside from that I'm a fan of Rivas and the fact that its open 24 hours makes it always a great option!"
4,"I have never been able to complain about anything I've ordered from here. Sometimes the dudes confused 'fries' with 'rice', but it's not like I especially NEED french fries. Prices are reasonable. They have a drive through.\n\nOne day I bought an Adobada burrito from Rivas and I swear to God it was THE BEST burrito I have ever had in my life. The pork was perfectly seasoned / perfect temperature and the tortilla was just perfect. Ugh. So good. Carne Asada is always great at Rivas. If you're into Carne Asada fries get them here.\n\nThe chile relleno isn't the best I've ever had, but definitely the best in comparison to small taco shops like Los Favoritos or Filibertos."
0,I had a terrible experience at this place.  I went through the drive-thru after a long day of moving.  I think it was about 1am when I ordered.  I ordered two crunchy ground beef tacos and a grilled chicken quesadilla.  The beef in the tacos were burnt and it was the worst taco I have ever eaten.  A complete waste of money.  The quesadilla wasn't much better.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone.  The ingredients weren't fresh and the food wasn't cooked properly.
3,"Riva's has great food, large quantities for low, low prices.  They're open 24 hours a day w/a drive through...I eat here at least once a week!"
2,"I'm giving Honeymoon Sweets an updated rating because I was contacted by the bakery yesterday and was offered a more than exceptable resolution. I'd rate them 4 stars for customer service, but to average it out, I give them three stars. Thank you for taking the time to follow-up and contact me."
1,"I must say I was rather disappointed when I called to try and do a tasting for my daughter's party that was needing a cake for at least 50 people. The lady on the phone said that they did not do tastings for cakes that were for 50 people and that they were booked for six weeks out anyway. \n\nMy husband and I used them for our weeding nine years ago and were quite please with the quality of the cake and with the service, but it seems like they no longer care, nor would they have received our business nine years ago since our wedding only was for 50 people. Needless to say, we ended up having to go with another cake place that didn't care if we were serving eight people or 1,000. Customer service is a must now a days! Two stars is for what I remember of their yummy cakes."
3,"Went here in search of something tart or pie-like as a birthday treat for someone (The birthday person doesn't like cake).  They had a decent pre-made selection of small tarts, small pies, and 2 whole pies available (Strawberry rhubarb and apple).  I decided on the apple, which was a very sizeable pie with a cinnamon-sugar crust.  The apple pie filling was delicious, it was just the right mix of sweet and tart and had a nice depth of flavor that made me want to eat more and more!  The crust was decent, I liked the cinnamon-sugar topping on the crust, but the crust itself was a little hard, and not very flaky.  I would like to come here again to try more bakery items!"
2,Had the mini eclair and cannoli and unfortunately it was nothing noteworthy.  They aren't located in a fun area and the business seems to focus on decorative wedding cakes.  However the person who helped us was super friendly!
1,"So I was walking out of REI after picking up some last minute supplies for a backpacking trip, and was about to get in my car when I remembered I hadn't eaten all day.  So I popped in looking for some quick grub.  There were a couple of people ahead of me in line so I expected some sort of wait for my food, but it took over 10 minutes after ordering for my order to be ready.  This isn't a nice sit-down restaurant, but more of a \""fast food\"" type, order-at-the-counter joint.  For a bean burrito and a couple of cheese enchiladas it should not have taken that long.  And it was definitely not worth the $9.  The bean burrito was okay if that.  The beans had no flavor (compared to other Mexican food places of the same style.)  The red enchilada sauce had a good flavor and definitely tasted homemade, but the cheese enchiladas were enchiladas minus the cheese.  Seriously.  All I was given were corn tortillas rolled up with a completely hollow and filling-less center.  WTF.  Definitely won't eat here again."
4,Love the meals they Are the best sea food in the Arizona area
1,Downhill is the key word - I don't know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere.
3,"We love Joe's Crab Shack.  We make the trip down from Scottsdale at least twice a month to enjoy Joe's wonderful Steam Pots.  A family favorite is the Lobster Daddy Steam Pot.  Even our 4 year old son loves Joe's.  Always a happy, family friendly environment."
0,"My roommate and I had been ordering from this place for over a year.  We were incredibly loyal and encouraged all of our friends to order from Pong Pong - I know from my own records that we've given these guys hundreds of dollars in business.\n\nLast week when we were moving and completely foodless, we followed our usual routine and called Pong Pong.  The food took an hour and a half to get there (they said 30-45 mins), the delivery driver called us twice, yelled at us and then hung up both times.  When he finally got there, he WHISTLED at us to come get the food from his car and when he didn't bring one of the meals we ordered, he simply apologized and left.  My roommate ended up having to get in his car and drive to get food after waiting over an hour for Pong Pong to bring us our simple, two entree order.  Not to mention, the food I ordered with no onions or mushrooms was covered in both.\n\nThe next day I called to speak with the manager and get my money back and they refused to reimburse my card, told me they \""understood\"" that I wouldn't be giving them anymore business after trying to remedy it with 15% off my next order.\n\nAre you kidding me?  \n\nDON'T ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.  I used to stick up for them when others said their food was gross and service bad, but apparently they really don't care about maintaining a report with loyal costumers and solving problems.  I know the economy sucks and everyone is trying to hold onto their pennies, but a free meal is all they needed to keep a steady flow of business from us and our multiple friends.\n\nAt this point, I'd go to Panda Express before Pong Pong."
1,"So I was a fan for many years, moved away, came back to area ordered and it was good.  Ordered again and wow it was not good for first time ever.  I called to let them know and I got the cook or so he said.  He said he worked there for 17+ years and nothing really changed but I said no mushrooms and they put canned mushrooms in which was not that big a deal cuz I just picked them all out but the chicken was completely overcooked and tough to chew.  The pot stickers were burnt but not slightly more like all over it had a weird brown color and then burnt on one side.  Tasted a little off too.  I thought they always made these by hand.  I think they still do but I dont know what the heck happened on this night.  Had egg foo young and that was dripping with oil.  The whole thing was a mess.  My husband and I both said if that were our first visit we would never be back."
1,"What happened to you guys?  I used to love your food.  I tried something different this time just to see if that was bad too and guess what?  Yep it was not good.  Waited more than an hour for delivery which is no big deal just letting you know.  Got the pong pong special chicken it was overcooked and chewy but I was hungry so I ate it however I did not put the left overs in the fridge.  No I just threw it out right away cuz I knew where it was eventually going anyway.  Why prolong it right?  Got pot stickers like I usually do and this time they werent a weird color and totally burnt while tasting a little funny no, this time they were really thick with dough.  So thick the dough was hard on the ends cuz it hadnt cooked through all the way and inside was very bland meat which was devoid of spices."
4,"I have finally found my groomer!! This place is absolutely amazing. The service here is TOP quality.. Absolutely no complaints.  I always schedule my appointments with Addie. With her work, you can definitely see how much she cares. My Yorkie, Preston, was given the best hair cut he has even seen. My Yorkie-Poo's hair cut was spot on. She cut his hair right on the very first time... It literally took my last groomer 3 attempts before she finally gave me what I wanted. \n\nIf you're in the market for a new groomer, for whatever reason, I highly recommend you trying this place out. I can call in the morning and they can get me in the same day. If I need a quick nail trimming, all I do is stop in and they will take a quick break to trim the nails. Support this locally owned and operated salon - you'll be so happy that you did :)"
2,"Same Kyoto bowl, in fact it was a time warp going in.  I had not been to one in years, looks the same, but well worn.  Food is still good, but a bit pricey for what you get."
1,"Take 15 pounds of typical Asian fast food entrees, dump them in a laundry machine with sugar instead of detergent, and serve on a fresh lump of sticky steamed rice. Don't get me wrong, its still decent. But that's the caliber of what you should expect here.\n\nThis place has got the cheer of a rest stop restroom. The guy I seem to always order form always looks like a manic depressive. But hey, if you want calories and it's on the way, go for it."
0,Ewwww! I drive by this place everyday. Thought I would give it a shot today. I took 2 bites and had to throw the rest away. I will never come here again. The owners should be embarrassed to serve this slop. I wish I could get my $7 back.
1,"This place is open earlier than other breakfast spots in the area. \nThe food is standard, nothing amazing. The atmosphere is fun and the music gets you going. \nThe service is S L O W! \nIt was like pulling teeth to have our server talk to us. We asked for the bill after we ordered to expedite the process, but that never happened. I couldn't believe how this guy drug his feet. He payed a lot of attention to the people ordering off the senior menu, I guess he thought the old folks would tip better?? \nAnywho...it's a good standby but definitely not a destination..."
1,"My wife and I needed a place to grab some lunchtime breakfast food over the weekend, and seeing as how we couldn't find anything better, we stopped by 5 and Diner. I've never been overly impressed with 5 and Diner in the past, and I have to say, they met my mediocre expectations this round as well. My wife ordered the pancake sandwich with two eggs and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with raisin toast. None of which was better than what you can make at home, but it wasn't disappointing either.\n\nOverall, the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills. However, here's where the problem comes in. When my wife ordered the pancake sandwich the server asked my wife \""do you like bacon or sausage\"", to which she replied \""bacon\"". Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said \""the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra\"". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on. The food was decent, but I have a big problem with dishonest servers and that's what knocks this place down from being a decent breakfast joint to just another bump on the road of mediocre cuisine."
3,Val and Bill are the bomb! Great friendly service and fresh delicious food! Chorizo made on site!
0,I took my cousin here to get her phone serviced. The greeter had no idea what he was doing. 20 minutes later we got some service but that was questionable as well.  Instead of replacing the phone they supposively fixed it but guess what......nope!
2,"Let me explain the 3 stars.  I give LoveSac 5 stars for their product. Love love love it.  We have their Sactional series and think it is the greatest thing, great quality, fun to configure, soft, comfy.  So definitely you can not go wrong with the product.  \n\nHowever, good luck dealing with the staff.   Every single time we have bought something, it is like having all of our teeth pulled.  It feels like they have no idea what they are doing.  Luckily, we have gritted our teeth and stood our ground, and everything has worked out each time.  \n\nBut on a recent visit, we were one of at least three customers in the store with complaints and problems in a 10-minute period.  Shouldn't they realize that if so many people are complaining, they should do something about their customer service?  Plus give more respect to repeat customers?  Order online instead to get the great product and have more control over your transaction!\n\nUPDATE:  I want to say that  \""Roy\"" has definitely come through for us this time and impressed us with his initiative; go Roy!  But this weird service issue has been ongoing since 2010.  So like I said, it usually works out, and there is at least one conscientious staffer, but in general the service is frustrating."
2,"The Streamliner (veggie) burger and Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich were good, but the shakes are out of this world!!  They stole the show.  I got the Strawberry Banana and my friend got the Orange Dreamsicle! YUM!"
4,"had a rush copy/print job today, Sunday, and Kayla was on the copy counter taking care of business - multiple customers, giving another employees guidance on 2 projects and she very professionally and quickly took care of my order.  I normally see maria in this department (also very qualified, professional)...so glad to have met Kayla and appreciate her help."
0,"I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either."
0,"After hearing a few individuals talk about Filibertos at work I thought I would give them a try.  Sadly to say after 3 different meals and visits to their drive thru I have to report the food is beyond edible or palatable.   On two occasions the beans and rice were disgusting.   I attempted the chicken quesadillas were sandwiched between two massive tortillas with queso slop not cheese, the chicken tasted like canned chicken that had not been opened in years.  Instead of putting sour cream and guacamole on the side it slopped on inside which added to a even sloppy mess.  The flavors were so bad that this expensive mess had to be just thrown out.  With all the options there are for Mexican food....runnnnn to somewhere else.  Serrano's was heaven compared to this place."
3,"I've been to this bar a few times in the evening, and it is a typical neighborhood bar, nothing special.  The regulars love the pizza, the drinks are cheap, and it is a small, dare I say, cozy place.  Not particularly the right place for me as a hang out, but I do have to tell you why I am rating it so high:\n\nAmazing trucker style breakfast!\n\nI was there on a Sunday looking for a greasy plate of eggs and a beer.  Oh my!  I found EXACTLY what I was looking for.\n\nThey serve all-you-can-eat breakfast from open to noon for $5.95!  \n\nEggs! Cooked however you like.\nHashbrowns! Your choice of peppers, onions, and cheese in them.\nSausage!  As much as you can swallow!\nBacon!  The pork industry is booming because of Final Round!\n\nEverything was hot and satisfying, and I washed it down with an ice cold draft beer.\n\nMy buddy and I both had a small pitcher each and two breakfasts, and the total was around $22 before tip.  I couldn't believe it! \n\nI need to say it again:\n\nAmazing trucker style breakfast"
2,"This review is for Sunday NFL Breakfast - good food as in the 'all you can eat' breakfast with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast. Good bar food. Also good was the French toast - 6 large triangles with good (maple) syrup. Service is SLOW here in the morning though with only one cook. But hey... it's Sunday NFL and the beer is cold and cheap and the wait staff is smiling all morning long while you watch your favorite teams play ball."
2,"Went with @quigonjinn and @mrsquigon, since they were driving.\n\nNice place.\n\nFree WiFi, which I think any business that has seating should provide, as a matter of doing business.\n\nGreat prices; $2 for a large house blend.\n(not a \""venti\"" because it isn't fucking starbucks! and that's a good thing)\n\nAmple outdoor seating. There was a dude playing the piano inside.\n\nThe re-purposed bank vault is cool as hell!\n\nA distance from where I live, but would go back if I were in the area and looking for coffee."
2,"I used to be a student and this place was awesome for studying and keeping caffeinated.  Now though, when I go there to relax, I feel like I'm sitting in a study hall with a coffee bar in it.  More power to them for catering to students, we all know these places are hard to find.  But, if you're a few years graduated, you may want to try somewhere else...or just get their coffee to go (it's very tasty)."
4,"So Indie its going to make me drive to Tempe lol Love the vibe here. Reminds me of The Jamaican Blue that use to be in Scottsdale. Good mix of a crowd, indie, punk, 70s sounds. Its great"
2,"I came here with my team of staff for a staff meeting because we prefer going and supporting local business than chains like Starbucks. And if we are meeting, why not take the opportunity to treat our staff at good quality local coffee shop too, just makes perfect sense to us.\n\nWhen the 4 of us arrived, the general indoor seating area had a few large tables (large enough for 4 people) that were taken by single persons. So we resorted to having our meeting in the \""vault\"" which has an open table large enough for us. This was our first time here and did not know whether the \""vault\"" area was a quiet area or not, but we tried to discuss work without being overly loud. An hour later, a fellow patron leaving the room told us that it was the \""quiet room\"" and that we should not be in there. \n\nNot seeing a single \""quiet\"" sign around, I decided to confirm with Xtreme Bean staff and their response was that they don't know why people have the impression that it is a quiet room. It is just another room, nothing special about it.\n\nSo I want to make sure my fellow patron knows, if you want to have a super quiet space to work at, maybe staying at home is a better option, or go to the library. Please don't tell fellow customers to leave, especially those who could not gain access to the large tables, because those were taken by other solo customers who love to spread out their belongings on a table large enough for a group of four.\n\nWe all love to support local businesses, so please make sure you know what the \""rules\"" actually are before confronting other customers about your need for \""quietness.\"" If that is so important to you, please stay home.\n\nSorry if this sounds more like a rant than a review. But I just want other customers to know about my overall experience here was a good one. \n\nThe staff was helpful and the drinks were decent, but us customers could do better to help support the business by being a little more considerate and not take up more space than we need to. \n\nIf you take up a table large enough for four and others had no choice but leave because of that, you are indirectly taking the business away from the coffee shop. With more people there, they will sell more drinks and food. Of course, unless you plan to purchase enough food and drinks to cover the difference between one customer and four customers. I am just talking from a business owner's point of view, since I run a small business too.\n\nNote to staff of Xtreme Beans, please let me know if I am wrong about the \""quiet room\"" since I last talked with you. I will be happy to take my staff somewhere else if the large tables were taken by single users and we could not use the customer designated \""quiet room.\"" \n\nWe are definitely going to give Xtreme Bean Coffee another try though."
3,My fav all time coffee destination in Tempe. It's a fabulous place to do homework and socialize.
0,"Oh boy!  My husband needed prgressive lenses.  The girl who helped (?) us told me we should get the \""premium\"" progressive as opposed to the standard.  I asked what the difference in price was and she WOULDNT TELL ME!  She figured it all out nd showed my, like a car salesman, on a computer, a price of $171.  With insurance!  When I said that was a lot, she said we should get insurance on the glasses for another $30!  Good luck with that, sister.   I later found out the standard progressive is $75 with our insurance. We walked and ordered the same glasses online from zinni for a grand total of $61 without using insurrance.  Hold on to the wallet here, folks!"
1,I found Dr. Waring not particularly attentive to my needs as a patient.
3,"My favorite Mongolian BBQ joint in the Phoenix area. HUGE HUGE portions, the only place where they let you smash the meat with wax paper, so much sauce and even the side bar is delicious. DO IT and I dare you to finish everything in your bowl."
1,"I thought this place was just OK as far as Mongolian grills go. It was fine but I have certainly been to better. This is the first one I have been to where you have to pay more if you want to make up more than one bowl of stir fry. The difference between a single bowl versus unlimited was $2.00 so whats the point of that? Then they have an ice cream machine near the soda dispensers but there is a big sign that says if you want ice cream, go back to the register and pay another dollar. Why not just charge one price for all? Anyway the meat and veggies were good but no seafood available. The sauces were OK but there was only one guy cooking so it took some time to get yours made up even with few people there. The place was not as clean as I would have liked but whatever. It wasn't awful but I'd not make a point to go here again."
1,This place is missing one key ingredient:  Flavor.
4,This place is great and the service is outstanding. I had never been here before and the manager personally helped me. I will definitely return
4,"In a city full of Fry's supermarkets, Sunflower Market is an excellent alternative for ASU denizens looking for cheapish foods, Hippie-style, especially since the only Trader Joe's is quite a drive away.  On weekends, they occasionally have BBQs...I grabbed 2 hamburgers for 2 bucks yesterday."
0,"Visited Sunflower last night in search of Scharffen Berger chocolates.  Nay on SB chocs, but you may find organic (Green &amp; Black's, Love, Newman's Own, etc.) in the impulse buy sections.  I sampled a peanut milk chocolate cluster and an almond chocolate cluster at the bulk section and decided I'd get some peanut ones.  I already had a plastic bag open and was about to jot down the item number on a label twisty-tie when I spotted something moving at the corner of my eye... I lifted the peanut chocolate cluster bin lid to have a look, and there was a 1/2- inch maggot doing its dance on one of the bin's walls!!  I dropped the lid shut, stared at the bugger to see if I wasn't just seeing things, lifted the lid back up and pinched it off the bin's wall with the plastic bag in hand, and handed the bag to a clerk and told him where I found it.  The manager on duty was close by so I repeated everything that transpired to her.  She said she'd empty and sanitize the bin immediately.  I didn't hang around to see if she did anything.\n\nUgh!  I'm getting shivers up and down my spine typing this just now!!  \n\nBTW, I had a look into the freezer aisles a few weeks ago to have a look at the Berto gelato selections and they ALL have a horrible case of freezer burn.  Looks like a pretty low turnover rate...  I'll try to see if Sunflower still carries Laloo goatmilk ice cream, but, honestly, I can't see myself going there anytime soon after the maggot incident...\n---\nUpdate: Just recalled that Sunflower never sold Laloo... I found Laloo's goatmilk ice cream at Whole Foods and AJ's Fine Foods.  Sorry for misleading!"
4,"I like this store a lot! They really go the extra mile to make it nice.          Very similar to Sprouts. I don't know if they are owned by the same people or not .  They give you 10cents off your bill for everyone of your forever bags that you bring in. That is the best deal i know of. Plus, they even have coffee out if you would like a sample. While shopping.     They have a deli which only provides Boar's Head. Which is a very good thing. No additves and GMO in it.   they will cut your meat and cheese any thickness you like and they put paper inbetween each slice. Which is a wonderful thing.   They even have Organic wine for a very good price.    Very many good things at this store , and well worth the visit."
1,Good food. OK prices. Just hope you never have a problem you want resolved because the management is no help whatsoever. You can't expect much from someone who manages a grocery store though.
2,"I give them three stars because they work cheap and are non-profit. Not exactly service with a smile, though.\nI got two of my cats spayed (one neutered there a year prior) and it was pretty cheap and the common surgery was a success. No problems there. They discovered one of the girls had ear mites pretty bad, but just did a bang-up job cleaning out their ears and gave me some drops to give them (which was a pain in the ass to use on the cats, but that's another story). I would of liked them to offer a better treatment for the ear mites.\n\nThe staff seemed absolutely miserable when I was there. It was early in the morning, but still...not a single smile or friendly greeting. It's a drab office and the operation seems very robotic. Get them in..get them out. But it's cheap, so what can you do.\n\nOverall...Good for cheap service, but I wish I had found out about the Scottsdale Cat Clinic (read my review for them) before I came here."
1,"I tried going here for groceries for a little while and the store was always clean and there was definitely always a lot of eye candy shopping here, but Safeway is kinda pricey... especially compared to the new Walmart Neighborhood Market that just went up down the street, and I've never checked out at this location without having to wait in a line.\n\nI also had a bad experience here a few weeks ago. I wanted to run into a place and grab some light beers, and just happened to be driving by Safeway and thought \""what the hell?\"" So I go in, grab a 6-pack of O'Douls (yes... non-alcoholic beer), and as I'm checking out the 5'2 Indian lady behind the counter (I think her name was Betty... something with double-consonants and short) claimed that my ID was fake! I'm a slightly over 6' and had plenty of stubble that day. \n\nBetty went on to have me repeat EVERY single line on my driver's license. Even after which she said, \""You are not 6', you look around 5'8.\"" This came from a lady who barely came up to my chin. When I told her that was ridiculous she actually made the claim \""this is not your ID\"", from which I started producing my credit card, work id (with photo), and school ID (with photo), which she stared at for 30 seconds while turning over trying to prove they were fake, then grunted and sold me my non-alcoholic beer... all while still acting as if she felt I was some sort of hooligan!\n\nWhen I asked Betty what her problem was, she said that the night before they had been \""raided\"" and her co-workers were given thousands of dollars of fines, and she didn't want to be fined. I understand that sucks, but it is not acceptable to make that interfere with your customer service and make customers feel like escaped prison convicts."
0,"Thought it was pretty sad that they charge $10 to have your X-rays emailed over to a new dentist (I moved therefore needed a new dentist). As a former customer, I would think they could include that as a courtesy, I've never charged for this by any other dental office. Granted its only $10, its the principal behind it."
0,"Worst customer service, extremely rude, my wife had a horrible experience and they would not give her the physical copies of the xrays she brought in. They said they would only email her copies. I was scheduled to go in and they canceled my appointment becauSe she left a bad review, without speaking with me or my wife first..... who does that.\n\n**Edit** to your response I can comment on your business because SOMEONE canceled my appointment based on her review not my wife she called and they said they couldn't find my appointment because it was already canceled. So either you are very uninformed with how your business is actually running or lying."
1,"I utilized him, Paul, about 3 years ago for a termite problem.  I picked him based on Yelp reviews.  He did the treatment and then had to come back to retreat about 4 months after the original application.  I called him on the phone and he said he would come back but he was not going to make anything since it was under warranty.  When he came to the house again he made it very clear that this was costing him money because it was all under warranty.  I have never experienced having a business owner try to make me feel bad for asking them to honor their warranty, a warranty that I paid extra for.  I will never utilize his services again."
1,"Went there for a NBA Playoff Game (Suns vs. Spurs) about a year ago.  It was crowded and there were many drunk dirty boys trying to score - ewwe!  It has the potential to be a nice little-hole-in-the-wall place, but as it stands currently-not so much.  Would not recommend this place."
2,"Doc and Eddy's is okay. Nothing special, nothing great. Might be a decent place to meet with a larger group of people for some bar food and drinks. The place is huge. You won't feel cramped going here.\n\nTowards the back, there are many pool tables and various games to play. There are more tables toward the front to eat. You can't go far without a TV in sight.\n\nI had the SoCal Chicken Sandwich on a recent visit. The sandwich was okay, a bit dry. I did like the seasoning on my fries though. I think the food is decent for a bar. I was actually full from the food when I left. That doesn't happen often. \n\nService was okay. The service was just enough to keep you satisfied, but not great that you felt you needed to tip extremely well. My previous experience the service was well below average. \n\nMy draft beer was pretty flat with no foam. I'm glad it wasn't half foam, but maybe a bit? For a place that serves draft beer, this is BAD!\n\nI can see myself going here from time to time, but mainly because it would be a few minute walk."
2,"There were ample pool tables which was nice but the sitting tables were seriously garbage. The seating was horrible and I felt like I was gonna fall every second. Also they were unnecessarily close to eachother. \n\nThe prices were alright for bar food. Nothing too special on pitchers of beer. \n\nThe food was SO good. Like, I was really surprised. Usually bar food is only tolerable. (even at some of my favorite sports bars)  But everything we ordered was extraordinary. It was restaurant quality and worth the price.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it'll keep me from going here again. Absolutely FULL to the brim with college pukes. If you don't know what a college puke is, I suggest you walk around Mill Ave from 6pm-11pm. You'll soon find out. Not my thing, but some people might love it. (college pukes)"
3,"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We went on a Saturday night so it was bustling with young people. They have every fun bar game you could imagine: pool, darts, shuffle board, air hockey, karaoke, and more. They also have Shocktop on tap which is a win-win for me. Get a couple drinks in you and you are bound to have a blast here. I know I did."
1,"Definitely not one of the best happy hours I've had unfortunately... =/\n\nMy co workers wanted to come here for happy hour since it's right down the street from our office. I never even knew it was here since  the location is not great at all. It is not close to the main intersection but close to the back street instead. When you first walk in, it's sooooo dark in there! I almost felt like I needed to turn on the flashlight on my phone to see. lol. \n\nI think the happy hour drink specials were not that bad. $2.50 for wells and wine and certain beers. I got the Pinot Grigio wine. Obviously this place isn't a wine bar so it wasn't that great. We ordered some appetizers as well. The nachos were a fail. =/ It was that type of cheese that wasn't necessarily melted on there but just straight up dry and stuck together on the chips. The wings were ok as well. My co workers ordered the spicy ones. I'm a total wuss and can't handle spicy at all but these were actually not even spicy. \n\nI guess this was an ok place to hang out. I like that they also have pool tables and air hockey to keep you occupied I guess while you're waiting for your food. Because our service was extremely slow. I probably won't be coming back unless the co workers wanted to or for some $2.50 drinks. =P"
3,Great layout.  It almost seemed like their bar had different venues.  Great food & selection of beers too.\n\nI was amazed how awesome the service was.  We went on a really busy night.
2,"Just played there yesterday with my wife.  It's a good course for beginners and other golf challenged people.  It was in fair shape.  The fairways and greens were pretty shaggy and the rough was mostly hardpan.\n\nDespite that, it was a fun round.  There are a few interesting holes.\n\nThe people in the clubhouse are super nice, so the after round drinks and food were great, too.  Great hot dogs!"
0,"I have been going to this golf course for over 15 years it's a hit or miss on coarse, as far as the condition.    You have a fun little nine hole family owned place to go.  They recently have remodeled the club house. I have been going once a week since last October with my dad.  Not any more I complained to the manager of the restaurant of the poor service you get it is hit or miss weather or not your going to get acknowledged or served especially in the late afternoon when I have gone with neighbors.   My dad went to the Valentines day dinner thought it was great so we decided to go for Easter Brunch Mistake...  we arrived at 12 most of the food like the fruit and deserts were picked over they had three scrambled egg dishes salad ham and turkey I think marginal Brunch not very attentive staff although they actually had plenty.  There was three in my party they added a 20% gratuity and the bill came to $88 I will never go back and I live in the neighborhood.   I gave you many chances and complained and you still couldn't figure it out. ."
2,"spontaneous visit during the summer with two other friends. \nMy main concern with this location is the fact that the salad bar, soup bar, hot foods corner were a lot smaller than the soup plantation in LA I always go to. \n\nThe food was good regardless, had a good time being fat sitting in one of the comfy booths they have. We sat right by the food for easy access hehe\n\nParking is widely available, huge lot."
2,"It always starts out great here but seems to gradually slide downhill after the first few bites.\nMost salad options look fairly good and I think I have been lucky in my selection.\nThere area also other cold salads on the bar. Tuna Noodle Salad of some type typically is one I'll try but on this visit is was soupy and just blech.  I couldn't even have a second bite.\nThe soup selection on the day we visited was good, but I guess I'm one that just likes soup.  I had the Chicken Enchilada on that day.  Lots of good flavor but I don't think I even had a bite of chicken.  Also tried the Chili but it was more beans than anything.  I mean every bite was a spoon full of beans.  My husband and sons theory is that I need to laddle a serving up from the middle of the pot and refrain from stirring the soup first. \nI wasn't going to serve up another bowl to find out.\n\nDessert is always a must even if it's just a bite of something sweet to end the meal.\nOn this occasion they had Red Velvet Cake with a cream cheese icing.  Looked appealing, well except for what it begins to look like after a couple dozen people attempt to serve thierself from a dish set under a hot lamp.\nOh yeah, and it doesn't help that they provide a long handled SPOON to cut and serve yourself a piece of cake.  \nC'mon staff, even one of those pizza servers would be 100 times better than a SPOON!\n\nOne bite of the RVC and some vanilla soft serve was more than enough.\n\nWe come every few months cuz that's more than enough for us.  \n\nIf you miss out on the Mon-Wed deal as another reviewer mentioned, I suggest you do a search online for coupons.  You might be surprised what you find."
0,"we went to STFK for the first and unfortunately the last time tonight. I'm not sure if they hired an outside company to come up with this concept or they thought of it internally, but they can save a ton of money by NOT remodeling the remaining stores, and will stop losing long time customers like us.  I always finished up with their chili, but now it's an additional $3.49, and no more hot chocolate chip cookies. BTW, no more coupons either, so it's time to look for another place to have a healthy meal..."
4,"Back to the sweet tomatoes we know and love, but the updated dishware and decor remain for a classier feel. Recommended!"
0,"DO NOT PURCHASE AN ANIMAL FROM HERE! These dogs are coming from puppy mills.  At puppy mills they do not care about quality, it's all about quantity. Dogs are caged and forced to breed, and once they can no longer breed, they are killed.  By purchasing an animal from here, you are supporting puppy mills.  If you do further research on the breeders they provide, you will see that they are all from puppy mills. \n\nMost of the dogs here are sick because they have not been treated properly.  They are in little glass windows that are full of diseases.  They have no love and attention.  These dogs should be out running and playing not helplessly trapped in a 3x3 cubicle!! It makes me sad to see these puppies and I want to save them all, but paying for them is going to give money to this horrible company that supports puppy mills and the mistreatment of animals! \n\nHere's a link to a video on puppy mills if you want to know more http://m.humanesociety.org/issues/puppy_mills/"
4,"Village Lanes is a great bowling experience.  This bowling center is clean, the staff is helpful, friendly, and attentive.  Recently renovated, the cleanliness of Village Lanes cannot be understated, because I am sure most people have had the dirty bowling center experience, and it can turn a fun family night into a seedy experience.  Village Lanes has a nice snack center and bar-lounge area; it could be great for birthday parties.  Cheers!"
4,"Returned to celebrate my son's birthday here again, and Wow!  Really impressed with the facility, SERVICE, and the whole experience.  My wife and I signed our son up for a birthday event (12 kids, 2 pizzas, sodas, etc..) we got all that and so much more.  \n\nFrom the moment we arrived to the end we had great service from Samantha who refrigerated the cake, served the food, took queues from us throughout, and in general brought everything we forgot to bring.  Phew!  Plates, forks for pizza (and clean ones for cake)... I can't compliment Samantha enough and her colleagues at AMF Tempe Village Lanes.  \n\nBefore it ever started they gave us classy invitations, envelopes galore, thank you cards, and cute goodie bags.  Wow - AMF really made this classy and easy for 2 very busy parents.  Needed this help with all that's going on besides the birthday event (before and after).\n\nOur son received a shiny new bowling pin that all his friends signed w/ a Sharpie (again provided by AMF Tempe Village Lanes - included in the package deal).  Balloons!!  Birthday jam music even played over the loud speaker EXACTLY when the cake was served.  Our son's name APPEARED on the screen and birthday wishes to him  scrolled across the overhead scoreboard/screens across all 4 lanes they gave us!  \n\nFolks were very nice about pulling up the bumpers on the lanes when we got to the-silly-stage of bowling and it took pressure off the kids that still find bowling awkward (no more gutter balls).  \n\nWe had a blast.  A/C was great.  It was a Sunday late morning event.  Plenty of room and fantastic service.  We'll be back to bowl and back to celebrate. \n\nZero regrets!  \n\nThanks AMF.  We had a blast; HIGHLY RECOMMEND parents strongly consider a bowling party at AMF Tempe Village Lanes even if you or your kids aren't serious bowlers (we aren't; we just like fun stuff).  \n\nProud Poppa"
0,"Another place I'd like to give a negative star review.\n\nFor starters, the lanes have entirely too much oil. I mean like, my ball towel was saturated before the night was over, and I didn't even play 3 entire games.\n\nWe were there sure a fundraiser, and entry was to include a pizza, and a pitcher of soda.\n\nRealizing most of the other bowlers had already received, and consumed their pies, I inquired as to the location of ours, only to be informed that it had already been brought. Funny, nobody told me, or my hungry children.\n\nThe manager seemed quite displeased to be asked to provide us the pizza we were owed, and finally, begrudgingly, brought three measly slices. I asked if that was all we got, and he said \""All the pizza have been brought out\""\n\nDude, we DIDN'T GET OURS!\n\nWhatever, they were just barely doing what they had to.\n\nI would never voluntarily return there on my own, but I would probably go back if I was invited there.\n\nFor the record, I prefer Brunswick lanes over AMF, and I prefer small establishments, rather than large corporate ventures."
4,Havent had any problems (lost or damaged clothes...) with them.  My stuff is always ready when they say it will be and it always comes out looking sharp.  Good place with reasonable pricing.
0,"I vow to never step foot into this mcdonald's again.  It is by far, the nastiest McDonald's I have ever visited.  \n\nWe went in today for an after school mcflurry.  The place smelled bad (think vomit) and it was dirty.  The upholstered chairs are in such bad shape that they have been \""repaired\"" with duct tape all along the entire bank of tables.  \n\nThis place gives me the creeps.  So long McDonald's.  I don't think I'll miss you."
2,"Very good experience here after suffering tire blowout on freeway. I'm clueless about wheels, tires, rims, but Vlade and the staff helped out nicely. They didn't have my tire size in stock, so Vlade ordered one and was supposed to put that tire on my car on Monday AM, but the tire got sold by mistake on Saturday even with his name on it reserved. My only issue is that he never called me on Monday to inform me of the situation. After I called, he apoligized and everything got taken care of on Tuesday finally. The tire was kind of expensive and they charge $16 for balancing and rotation crap (which I think I can find for free at most places), but people need tires so pony up if you don't shop around. They did leave my rims pretty dirty too and are a very busy location, so make an appointment and shop around first. I thought that the tire that blew out was from Discount Tire, but it turned out it wasn't, which left me stuck there. Still nice staff."
3,"Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop. It can quickly become \""your\"" coffee shop.\n\nDowns: Drinks are a bit expensive. Quality of pulled shots can vary between baristas, sometimes it can get crowded. No actual food. No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask)."
4,"I love this little coffee shop. Amidst all of the commercial coffee places around, this seems down to earth and unassuming.  The barista is always friendly.  I like to support local businesses and would, by far, support Gold Bar than Starbucks located across the parking lot."
3,This is a great neighborhood coffee house. Family owned and friendly. Best pastries around!! And their coffee is better than the close competition. They also have delicious cold brew iced teas every day. It's a great spot to relax on a hot afternoon. I love the friendly laid back atmosphere.
1,"first time here and it was OK. the place smelled real bad, like urine, especially the elevator. service was okay, we had to call the guy over a few times. they didn't even check on us. wings were good, bbq chicken pizza was good except for the fact that it was over powered by a whole bunch of garlic cloves. ugh, i love garlic cloves but man, there was too much on there. the cool thing though is that they have that asian photobooth thing and a karaoke booth!"
1,"Long after man has left this planet, remnants of its glory shall remain. Much like the end scene of Planet of the Apes, man's masterpieces cannot be fully erased.\n\nFull disclosure: Gameworks was never amazing, nor was it a consummate achievement of mankind, but my god in heaven, has it fallen far from being an enjoyable diversion.\n\nVisiting Gameworks the other night after a movie, I did not even recognize the inside. In the past year, Gameworks has transitioned from a two-story video game mecca to a trashy, shotgun-style Dave and Buster's knock-off with a few old racing and carnage games sprinkled along the wings. What was once full of racing simulation games, a multi-story pirate-cum-balloon fight (or for the old folks, it used to be a shooting tower), and new-age arcade games, has become a vacuous shell with half-corroded consoles and token-munching, brainless ticket dispensers. \n\nMuch of the interior has been gutted, leaving odd walking patterns and vast arrays of blank canvas. 10-15% of the arcade games were \""under repair\"" and another 5-10% were in great need of service (Virtua Tennis now has the cinematography of a Lumiere Bros. film). The remaining games feature nothing you could not find in the lobby of a movie theatre. Instead, Gameworks' focus is on ticket-oriented games such as Deal or No Deal and some game where you jump in the air and get tickets depending on when you land in relation to an arbitrary, electronic lighting wheel.\n\nIf that level of lowest common denominator banality thrills you, change this rating to 5 stars.\n\nIf I'm scraping the bottle of the barrel for positivity, I can compliment their beer selection (San Tan and 4 Peaks) and pricing (5 bones a pint); however, that does not justify the large-scale Peter Piper Pizza whitewashing of Gameworks' product line.\n\nI'm giving it a courtesy star for the fond memories, but, like Lady Liberty on the beachhead, Gameworks is completely broken."
1,"allow me to join the chorus of \""what happened to this place?\""s.  my first visit, about 15(!) years ago, was quickly followed by several more because the place was a lot of fun.  in the intervening time, yes, i've changed a bit - but Gameworks has changed more, and not in a good way.\n\nmost of the games here dispense tickets, quickly followed by a raft of mediocre racing simulators that are from a generation or two ago.  a lot of the semi-unique things i might've tried are \""under repair.\""  maybe most disappointingly, there are only four real vintage games - and their CRTs are in bad shape.\n\nGameworks is something i used to look forward to visiting when i was in this area, not so much because i think it's a great place but for the memories.  well, no use now - it's a shell of its former self.  best to leave what good memories remain untainted, stay that way.\n\n(note:  if you're taking little kids, it might be pretty good.  i wouldn't guess 5 stars for that even, though.)"
0,I can't stand this place.  I made 3 attempts to purchase (and to get educated) on a new mountain bike.  The sales staff were arrogant and completely useless.  I finally purchased a new bike from another store.  It's a shame as Landis is right by my house.  I will not even buy an inner tube from them.
4,"These guys know what they're doing.  My yellow Trek Marlin 5 acquired a broken spoke somehow while riding which then loosened all the other spokes, but Landis was able to fix everything and get the wheel true again.  I think the knowledgable guy who worked on my rear wheel was named Phil.  It's nice to know that I have a good neighborhood bike shop.  My brother was impressed with the service enough to say, \""You know, that makes me want to buy a bike from them.\""  I'm sure he will."
3,"Dear Venezia's,\n\nI hate to default to standard letter format for this review but this is the best way that I can keep it from devolving into a total creepstore gush.\n\nI love you because when you deliver, it gets to my house hot. I love that you have been here for me during finals. Without you, I would have lived off of Clif Bars and Vitamin Water alone. You provided me with the necessary carbs to go on thinking for another 12 hours. Sometimes, you even gave me fruits and veggies. I appreciate that, \n\nI didn't give 5 stars because sometimes (just sometimes!) your pizza is uber greasy...but I know it's not because of anything gross. It's all the cheese you put on there. I like the cheese, hate the grease. I'm sorry that there's no middle ground on this.\n\nAside from that, thank you for the tangy sauce that doesn't taste like someone dumped sugar in it. Thank you for the crispy/chewy crust (how do you do that!?) and thank you for being local.\n\nSincerely, \nThat weird chick who looks your hot, indie boy drivers up and down\n\n*I re-read this and realized that, standard letter form be damned, I was still plenty creepy. Sorry Venezia's..."
1,"Hmm,  been eating here off and on for the last several years;   and I've noticed a very definitive decline in quality of the pizza since they expanded this location.  The last two times I have ordered, once was for delivery; the other was store pick-up.  \n\nIts a battle of pizza in Tempe, and when i spend almost 20 bucks for a pizza; I expect it to be pretty tasty.  The delivered pizza was not, in both sauce and toppings, it was nothing spectacular; and the delivery took almost an hr. Which, might of contributed to the pizza not being very good.\n\nMy most recent pizza, was in my assuming that a picked up pizza would be fresh and better than my delivery was. I was wrong; the white pizza (no sauce, olive oil and ricotta,) was possibly worse than the delivery. And, for 20 bucks I could of gotten 2 pizzas at jamies pizzeria in the neighborhood that I KNOW would of been better than this.  \n\nOh well, I don't know if their expansion has led to the quality going down, or that the place has many different locations now and as such whatever was special is no longer so, but its very obvious to me that whatever I thought was SO GOOD about venezias prior, is not. And I won't be trying it again."
3,"While the pizza was most definitely delicious, the process of trying to order cheeseless pizza was so clunky that even though the cashier and the manager confirmed the order, the cook still put mozzarella on it. Still four stars, however, since once this was brought to their attention they gave us another pizza, free of charge.\n\nIt was also very clean and had some awesome menu choices. Definitely planning on eating there again."
0,oh my god worst pizza I've ever had. Tasted worse than school cafeteria pizza. Ordered a small at 2 bites and immediately stopped eating. DISGUSTING
3,Love Wendy's new salads and burgers. This was my first visit to this particular location and I found it to be very clean. I felt bad for the guy running the cash register because no one was helping him but he was very polite.
0,"I was studying for finals and so driving back and forth to campus a lot.  All of a sudden one evening my car's coolant light went on.  I take care of my car and so was concerned about the light.  I took it into Purcells where they proceeded to tell me that my car might overheat and explode if I continued to drive it, thus making me their captive.  I called my fiancee and told him the deal.  A couple hours later Purcells contacted me and said the engine needed repair and would cost around $900.  I asked if there were any sort of discounts and they said no.  Then when my fiancee went in they magically made it only cost $700.  I still don't think anything was wrong with my engine after all is said and done, but just paid them and went on my way, vowing to never come back."
1,"First time dining here. I am visiting from out of town and my family and i were expecting a good meal. \nHowever, i cant say that was the case. For starters our drinks were TERRIBLE. I ordered a whiskey ginger ale. \nThey do not have ginger ale. They have soda water and pepsi that they will give to you without warning. After returning the first set of drinks we got a second drink which was supposed to be 7up and scotch. It wasnt. I don't know what it was, but it wasn't what i ordered. I couldn't taste any scotch and my drink was still a caramel color. \nThe owners were constantly over our shoulders begging for praise and attention. \nAfter getting our weak drinks we got our hummus which was not terrible but i wasn't impressed. \nWe all ordered our food from the female half of ownership who was insistent on us ordering the lamb. None of us are plain lamb fans so after repeatedly declining her offer we were able to order. Our server went into the back to cook our food and the busser brought out our soup. The Lentil soup lacked flavor, i was upset because it looked amazing. The tomato soup was good. Not extraordinary, but good. \nNext we received our meals.  Gyro salad, beef kabob, gyro kabob and some other kabob i cannot pronounce. Ground beef in the shape of a sausage-turd. Either way, the meat was very dry, in all cases and kind of unpleasant to eat. Large chunks of unexpected toughness in my meat. The rice was plain, and lacked substance. I was hungry enough where i finished my meal, i cant say the same about the rest of my company even being as hungry as we were after a long day of traveling. After warding off the owner for a fifth and sixth time, we had to ask for our check and to go boxes which we decided upon not using anyway. I was extremely disappointed from the start, and had high hopes that it would improve with our meals, but it just never did. \nI will not be returning nor will i suggest this place to my friends. I was very upset with everything because i was very excited to try this place out.  \nI give one star for our meal, and two for service. As obnoxious as it was having the owners constantly over our shoulders we received everything in a timely manner and our specific requests were granted."
3,The wife and I stopped here for a bite and beer and was surprised. The steaks we ordered were huge and very tasty. Overall good beer selection and great service from Robin made foe a great evening.
2,"wow. i REALLY like average mexican food.  i grew up with manuel's, the original one in phoenix.  and i'm happy to say, this food is familiar and comforting to me.  it may not be the best, i can see how some may think it's just the worst. not me. me likey."
3,"Had lunch here the other day with a Groupon.  The staff as well as the chips and salsa were great.  The food was super.  The lunch deal included the entree as well as beans and rice and the portion was more than substantial.  The server (Carlos, I think) was super polite, very efficient and explained  what was contained in each item we ordered. A great Mexican place in this part of town."
1,"This place has tasteless food that is over priced. It is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but I choose to go to Suzie's, or Poncho's in Phoenix. If you want good Mexican food do your self a favor and go somewhere else."
3,"Great pizza at a good price.  It isn't exactly like the Chicago style that I had in Chicago (an upside down pizza), but it is the closest I have found in the valley."
4,"I ate here with my family more times than I can count when I was growing up.  It's also one of the go-to spots when my friends from high school want to get together.  This is a quintessential neighborhood pizza restaurant and bar.  They have a good selection of craft beers, including ones from Four Peaks and Stone brewing on tap.  The tortellini toss salad is absolutely to die for, especially when you drown it in their homemade Italian dressing.  The dressing is thick and has a hint of tomato goodness.  I always order the enchilada pizza- black beans, green chili, grilled chicken with a side of sour cream, guac, diced red onions and lettuce.  I load all that stuff on top of the pizza and it is a divine pie."
0,"I usually say that Nello's has the best pizza but tonight we had the worst experience. The food wasn't that great, and some of the servers were horrible.  There was a man who seemed to be part of the management team, well he knew all the regulars  and carried on with each one of them while cursing.  Mind you I was sitting by the bar but had a family sitting behind me, children shouldn't fall subject to a manager's lack of common decency to watch his language while working.  We then asked if we could have the tv that was facing us changed to a particular channel, when our waiter asked the manager for help he said and I quote \""tell them to turn their head and watch the tv they see it on\"". At this point I was furious, had we not already received our food we would have walked out, but wait it gets better.  So then a group comes in who happen to be regular's, and they ask for the same tv to be changed and guess who jumps on this, yup!  I didn't get this man's name but he was the oldest person on staff with an east coast accent and wore black framed glasses.  All I can say is that this experience will definitely affect the choice I make the next time I want pizza, Nello's won't be my first choice."
3,"This review is simply about the quality of the IMAX screen and viewing experience rather than the surrounding environment (AZ Mills Mall). This is the only true IMAX screen in Phoenix. If you see a movie here you will truly be engrossed in the film. The screen is so big that sometimes it even feels as if your stomach drops even if it is not a 3D movie. I've seen several movies here including Prometheus, Dark Knight Rises and most recently Oblivion. Any \""space\"" based movies are especially spectacular on this screen because you really feel like you are there. The bathrooms are a little small but it has never been so busy that I had to wait a long time and they have always been reasonably clean. I will come back to IMAX because I love movies and I especially love feeling like I am part of one."
4,"I've been to lots of Marshalls in different cities and states, but I'd say the staff here are definitely the friendliest.\n\nI was in this evening getting a couple makeup bags for Christmas presents, and the lady who rang my purchase was so helpful and sweet. Her name was Susan."
2,"The staff here is always very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, they run out of things very quickly. Today they were out of bagels, regular cream cheese, and coffee stoppers before 11 am. It's never fun finding out AFTER you order and pay for something that it's unavailable. I wish their stock was as consistent as their service, but I'm not going in there for the service."
3,"Food isn't great except for the tots... the tots are delicious. I also really like the $1 mini candy deserts. It's just the right size and so yummy! But ultimately, the 4 stars are for the drinks. Cherry and strawberry limeades, watermelon slushy.. the possibilities are endless. This place is a nice treat when the weather gets warm!"
0,"Wow.... where do I start? \nWell about a week ago I ordered a burger and a side, I received the wrong burger and the wrong side, but I had already rode my bike home. So I called the manager on duty, lets call him \""T\"". He was SUPER kind and wrote me down for a comp the next time I came in which was tonight. \nI came all the way from phoenix but wanted to claim my free meal on the way home so I stopped in. It took them 15 MIN to bring out my comp order, but it was wrong again because they didn't read the order back to me to verify (and they never have). So I told the carhop and it took another ten minutes to get the correct burger out to me. By this time, my side item was cold. I had every intention of tipping the carhop even though I was claiming a free order. But she was so distant and lacked people skills and didn't remember the things I requested and didn't look me in the eyes, plus my order was wrong a third time. By the time I rode home, my food was cold (I even had it in a warm environment for the whole journey) and there was little to no condiments on my burger! Who wants a dry burger? Not this guy.\nAll I can say, is the night manager on duty every time I go there looks like a punk (hood always covering his face, and I sound old for saying that, but I'm a 25 year old punk rocker myself, haha) and the kitchen seems to be stoned because I witnessed 3 inaccurate orders while I was trying to claim mine. \nMy main complaint is that I worked at Sonic for over 2 years, and this kind of behavior at my locations would've gotten me fired. I've returned to the restaurant business since then and my philosophy is STILL to treat the customer how you would like to be treated. What's so hard about that?! Yeah, it's fast food. Yeah, they get paid minimum wage. But if you cant even follow your recipes, common sense, and core values, you don't deserve to have the job. There's many people out of work who would kill to have a job, even at Sonic.\nIt's sad because this location is RIGHT by my house and it's good for a quick, cheap meal, but I will not be returning. This is absolutely the WORST Sonic experience I've ever had and it's the worst Sonic I've been to. What a shame, too, because it's in such a nice area. Maybe it's just the night crew since that's the time I usually visit, but all I know is this location needs a revamping of values and employees."
2,"It is the closest sports bar, so when playoff time rolls around I have to get my fix. But wait, I'm a Red Sox fan. Whatever, I went in anyways not really caring for rivalries. I didn't notice an overwhelming New York vibe or anything, just a table full of hooligans in the booth next to us. I was somewhat amused by the company logo upon looking at the menu. Expecting a gangster Yankee theme, it was humbly a chicken riding a buffalo.\n\nOur server was extremely pleasant, although perhaps had her hands full with the table next to us. My beer ran out and sat there arid for some time, whether that means I have a problem or not it was still a slight buzz kill. I began with 6 Wings and then dived into a Skyscraper Burger- which was absolutely delicious! Being one of the largest items on the menu I had to tackle it due to the nature of my appetite. Although pricey, the Burger is probably worth it and the wings were solid. Massive TV's are everywhere, and it is a very comfortable setting... I liked it and will probably go in again for the upcoming season."
2,"Julie was probably the best part of this experience. She was the super duper friendly bartender chatting me up and explaining all the specials and items on the menu. Nothing has really changed since they changed the name, but at least they are still giving free entrees on your birthday.  Oh wait..they claim to have new super crunchy fries now, but I would say super salty is a better description.  Not crunchy either. The philly at 8.99 was decent, it had mozzarella cheese and the menu said ribeye..but not quite convinced. The big excitement for me was a fly landing on half my sandwich for over the two second fly limit. They were nice and re - made the other half. Go for Julie and tip her well...she deserves it."
1,"Website does not reflect accurate stock levels, company fails to inform customers of out of stock items and processes the order short, when you call to address the matter, they very rudely talk over you and hang up. I take that as a sign they don;t want my business, I will be happy to oblige."
0,"I hate myself every time I wind up shopping here. Having to lock up my purse, indifferent staff, high prices....  plus they carry very little sterling and charge through the nose for what they do have."
0,"Bleh. This place looks pretty rough, but it's been here for a long time and I was thinking that the food must be pretty good if it's survived that long. Wrong.  I'd say that at least half of my Hunan chicken & shrimp combo went in the trash. I could've done better with Panda Express and I'll be eating a bowl of Cap'n Crunch in hour or two.\n\n\nFortune cookie: Desire, like the atom, is explosive with creative force. In bed."
2,Generous portions and good sweet and sour shrimp but nothing extraordinary about their fried rice or lo mein
3,"I've ordered from this place three or four times, and each time they've delivered in less than an hour. They are very well priced, and consistent in their quality of food. It is not the utter best chinese food I've ever had, but its pretty good and delivers later than a lot of other places. \n\nThe crab puffs are the best I've ever had, anywhere, though. Seriously, they have much more \""crab\"" and a lot less too-crunchy fried wonton stuff. the hot and sour soup is flavorful, but not that spicy. I'd prefer it more sour and more hot, myself. The hunan chicken is great, and so is the broccoli chicken. Overall, good quality food and good delivery!"
0,"Terrible customer service. I called Walgreen's customer service 4 times, and never received a call from management as promised. Here is the email I sent them, which I have not received a reply to either!\n\nThis is the Walgreen's located at 2000 S Mill Ave  Tempe, AZ\n\n\""I have called, and spoke with your customer service several times, but have never received a call back as I was promised. The phone number associated with these calls is 480.967.XXXX. The exact date and time should be in the notes from those calls. I am xxxx xxxx, a 59 year old Walgreen's customer of 30 years. I ride a small two wheel electric scooter. It is smaller than a shopping cart. It is not practical to lock this scooter, and the expensive batteries cannot be secured. This scooter is like a two wheeled skateboard with handle bars. I have ridden it to Walgreen's, and brought it in the store with me to pick up prescriptions on many occasions. The last time I picked up a prescription I was told by a man, I assume is a manager, that I can't bring my scooter in the store anymore. This is ridiculous as it is small, makes no noise, makes no mess, takes up very little room, and is my only means of transportation right now. No one has ever complained about it, and when I mentioned not being allowed to bring it in to the pharmacist, he could not understand why, and commented that people bring bikes in the store. I bring this scooter into the grocery, hardware store, fast food stores, and everywhere I go with no problems. I explained this on the phone to your representative, and was told I would be contacted. I was never contacted even after calling back several times, and was told the complaint was being escalated. . This is terrible customer service! I regret that I am contacting my Dr., and having my prescriptions transferred to CVS. CVS has no problem with me bringing my scooter in the store, and  also allow my dog in the store, if I walk there with my dog. I am very disappointed with Walgreen's apparent lack of concern. I will also leave reviews on line wherever possible to let other people know of this incident. \"""
1,"Went in on a Groupon, food was good but also greasy, but not enuff for me to go out of my way to eat there. \nWent there at lunch, it was dead, but yet took forever to get our food."
1,"Not a great place. I do not mind old rundown places but you could smell the fresh urinal cake.  Went for lunch on a Wednesday and only two other people in there. Owner took order at register which was fine but he didn't seem to be into the whole thing,  older gentleman brought drinks and food.  I think he washed dishes too.  Tacos were greasy and food was so so at best. My boss ordered a carne asada chimi that was full of greasy, old, and fatty pork.  Just not a good experience.  I think they worry about the bar business at night.  The older gentleman was very kind and courteous though."
4,"Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!"
1,"I'm not usually one to pay double to have my oil done in fifteen minutes, but a couple times, like before a road trip i would have no choice.\n\none time everything was just fine, everyone was pleasant. but i hate the nonsense of them pulling you out to your car, lifting your hood and giving the rehearsed, ten times a day spiel about needing a new air filter, windshield wipers, windshield fluid..blah blah blah. one time in the spiel i totally thought the guy said that my \""cabin pressure\"" was off. when i interrupted to ask \""did you just say cabin pressure?\"" he was so taken off guard that i was listening to everyone word, he didn't know what to say.\nanyway, not a fan of this location"
0,This is the worst place ever. They don't even deserve 1 star. I went to get my\nOil changed they recommended I have my battery cleaned as well. My car was then stuck in 4wheel drive. I had to go to 2 different mechanics to have it fixed. The people at this jiffy lube should NEVER be able to touch anyone's car.
1,"walked in with a $24.95 oil change (special) coupon.  I was told they'd knock off $10.  Yeah, right...never happened.  Walked out spending $83.00.  Jiffy Lube is notorious for \""bait and switch\"" games.  Workers there are trained to never let the customer leave without spending maximum money.  I watched them closely...they were low on synthetic 5-20 oil...topped off my engine with 5-40w.  Beware."
2,"Went in yesterday with a few girls to get prepped for a wedding. It was my first manipedi in FOREVER, so I really would have been pleased with anything, as long as they didn't rip my nails off. Anyways, I was pretty pleased with my experience, and even ended up getting my brows waxed when I was in, though two of the girls had some issues with their acrylics they had done. Shortly after leaving, there were some scuffs on my toe polish, and I can't have that since I'm wearing heels for this wedding. So I'll go in tomorrow and see how they deal with that. Would I come back otherwise? Meh, not sure. But for $38, it definitely wasn't bad."
0,"I was not impressed!! I went here because of the reviews, but found that the service was poor, the food mediocre, and not hot enough for me. I am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat. I love the food, being from NM and also love the heat...this one fails...would not go back!!"
4,Best Mexican Food in the valley!!!  Yummmmmmy!!!!!!  Super nice family!!!!
3,"They did a good job cleaning a coat where other places wouldn't be able to take it.\n\nThe reason I took off one star is because the owner originally quoted me $12 and the next day when I picked it up he said $15. It's not the problem with it being $3, the problem is that he did not stick with the quote that he said, he blamed it on a long day of work and did not correctly measure the length of the coat at first. If he told me it was an error, but he would stick with the previous price then that would've been great."
4,"After being told by my dealership that my car was in immediate need of new brake pads, I took my car over to Brake Masters and worked with Steve.  I was on lunch, so I had a coworker drop me off - and asked him to call me and let me know what the deal was with them.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I get a call... my brakes are absolutely fine, and they were not going to do any work.  It's clear that I was lied to by my dealership, and that Brake Masters was completely honest with me.  It would have been easy for them to not tell me and take my money - but that one simple phone call has earned them my business... when I actually need work done!"
1,"I think the owners were nice, but when not supervised, the staff was rude, and only interested in talking with friends instead of helping the customer. I don't expect much when it comes to game stores, much like the service at a Chinese restaurant it usually stinks...  But these guys were jerks, and unwilling to assist or even move from their fixed location.    We left the store saying we would never go back.  Their D&D miniature selection is good, so I hope they get better service some day."
4,"In a word.......FANTASTIC!\nI went in for what I thought was going to be an EXPENSIVE fix and was delighted to find that less than $30.00 (YES, THIRTY DOLLARS) later i am back on the road and the fender is looking fine!!!\n\nThe coolest part was that the owners father was out in the shop, under my car looking and giving advice!   I want to be that engaged at 86 years of age.  An honest family owned business that is true to their word.  I am certainly glad I grabbed the card I saw at IMM."
4,"Was recommended this place for work on my '75 bus and was extremely satisfied.  They are very experienced, knowledgeable, and reasonable.  They answered a ton of questions I had and were genuinely honest.  I felt very comfortable immediately.  Super friendly and flexible as well.  They arranged for me to drop off on a Saturday outside of business hours and let me keep my bus there for a week while I was out of town.  I'd highly recommend to anyone and everyone."
4,"Amazing service! I just moved to Arizona and my A/C went out, took my car in and they had it fixed the same day! The price was very affordable and Victor and the staff were very professional, definitely sticking with this shop for all my car repairs!"
2,"My mom gets a bigger kick out of this place than I do. It seemed to specialize in upholstery, and the walls are lined with swatches. I did like that the woman allowed me to take mini-swatches off of the wall, but I didn't wind up finding any fabrics that worked for my projects. I'll definitely try back here."
4,"Out of all of the local Indian restaurants I have tried, Royal Taj is by far the best! The curries are amazing and the meat (and paneer) is always tasty! While the people who own the restaurant may seem a bit distant, they are just shy and open up when you talk to them! Be sure to come here when you crave good Indian!"
2,"Like most of the reviews have already stated... no one else was in the restaurant. I don't understand how they stay in business, and I assumed the restaurant portion of the building was merely a front. \n\nI did not enjoy the atmosphere of this place, at all. A nice woman took our order, then went to the kitchen to make it, I assume. The food was decent, actually pretty tasty. I ordered the vegetable platter, it was about 15 dollars which was twice as much as what my friend got, for half as much food. I didn't care, I thought it was pretty delicious. \n\nI don't think I will go back because I'm fairly sure I can find a decent indian food place with a slightly better vibe."
3,"Just stopped by here for dinner the other day and figured I'd write a review.  I've been here twice and have had a good experience both times.  Their food is very tasty.  When I went for lunch I thought their selection wasn't as big as other places, but everything was well prepared.  Out of both, I prefered dinner even though we were the only people in the place.  The food came out pretty quick and was super fresh.  The meat samosa, garlic naan, chicken biriyani, chicken curry, and tikki masala were all great.  I think even though everyone seems to love the tikki masala I liked the curry better.  ALSO to note, it was very spicy, more than when prepared for the buffet I think, which I thought was great."
3,"How can you not love REI? I'm not really sure what type of personality that would be. Probably insanely boring. REI has great gear for hiking, camping, all sorts of sports and you can't beat being a member.\n\nThe store in Tempe is pretty clean and fairly close to my house. The staff for the most part has always been helpful aside from the one time I was told something I wanted didn't even exist (yet it was available online).\n\nI have to lower them to 4 stars because there's been so many times I've had to order from REI online and have it delivered to the store because they didn't carry what I wanted."
0,Prices were out of this world high.  We walked in looked at pricing on just a couple items that we have been looking at and their price was so high and so out of line we both just turned right around and walked out.  I dont mind paying more for something to have it now but they take their  high prices to another level.  Just not that impressed with them.
0,"Terrible experience at this office. I've gone back twice for the same problem and am still having issues. Ironically enough, before the filling my tooth felt fine and ever since the procedure i've had nothing but problems with the tooth. I will not be returning to this office ever again. Maybe It was a fluke... but I doubt it and i'm not going to stick around to find out."
0,"i went to this place because of their good reviews here on yelp...\nim honestly wondering if i went to the wrong place.\ni called 15 minutes before me and my mom headed in\nthey said they would be able to take us both right away\nonce we got there we waited 15 minutes before they even started my moms full set\nthen i had to wait another 10 minutes for them to start my manicure\nwhy does it seem like all nail places do this? if you cant take me right away when i ask, please dont LIE just to get me to come there.\ni got white tips and im not too impressed. there are bubbles all through their top coat and the guy couldnt even cut/file my nails evenly\ni definitely will NOT be back.\nwish i could give ZERO stars"
0,"Unfortunately, I had a really terrible experience at this salon. I was excited to try a new place for a great price (with a gel manicure groupon) however when I got to the salon, the lady redeemed my groupon on my phone and then immediately claimed no such thing happened. I saw her press the button with my very eyes and genuinely thought this was a bad joke. After I showed her she redeemed it she started arguing with me saying I need to pay again, that my groupon was invalid, and basically accusing me of stealing. I was horrified. She then proceeded to turn to  her coworkers and very obviously talk about me.   It was the most appalling customer service I have ever seen. She went on to make me pay full price for my manicure even though I had a legitimate groupon. I would have left immediately had my friend (who also had a groupon) was not already inside. My friend was serviced by a different gentleman and did not have any  problems. She also simply showed her phone to the person, pressed redeem and went on to get a manicure in peace. We were both extremely appalled at their behavior and the terrible treatment of a new customer.  I am never going back."
3,"I don't know where everyone was but this is a rad little place. Pretty good food, cheap beers and quite delicious. Very personable staff as well. I enjoyed my visit."
0,"June 25, 2014: Normally this place has pretty good food. Their pretzels with cheese are really good. Today my work colleagues and I went to Pranksters for lunch. When we got there we immediately were overwhelmed by the smell of urinal cakes and raw sewage. It was overwhelming but when we asked the waitress about it, she said she didn't notice it.  Really?  I think she was instructed not to acknowledge it if customers were to ask about it. How could she NOT notice?\n\nUpdate: July 18: my co workers and I went back, expecting that the odor would be now resolved. No luck. We walked in, took one breath, and were hit with the exact same odor as 4 weeks prior. We turned around and got back in the car. A man, I presume was the manager, followed us outside and apologized and told us they had someone coming to address it later that day. \n\nI can't imagine going back again."
0,"1 star from the vegan perspective, as they use whey (an animal protein) in most of their breads, including their white and wheat sub breads. Please drop the whey (and all other animal products) from your breads!"
4,"I'm from the area and my family loved this place when I was younger, I was never a fan. My mom still loves it and wanted to go here for her birthday recently. Of course, we reluctantly agreed. There were about 15 of us with no reservations on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly and our waitress was awesome. I hadn't been in so long and didn't like it when I was there, so I asked my sister what to order. She gets the chicken romano. I decided I would give it a try... OMG! It was absolutely amazing. It's a thin piece of chicken, breaded and fried, then placed on melted butter (almost overflowing the plate) and topped with green onions and garlic. It was the size of the plate so I didn't eat the side of spaghetti that came with it. Since this visit, I have been back weekly and would recommend the NY Style Mild Wings and the Chicken Romano, sometimes I get them on the same visit and take the leftovers home. Portions are huge, service is great and the flavored iced tea is awesome! We will continue to visit and hope the food stays the same!\n\nSide note: We went there two nights ago with our 1 year old daughter and realized we were out of milk, we asked if we could order a tall glass of milk. The waiter said he'd be glad to fill the bottle for us, so he asked us to take the lid off and filled it. When our bill came the milk was not on there. We asked them about it and they said, on the house!"
0,"I walked in with my family and we waited to be seated...for 10 min! Employees saw us there and just ignored us and kept going about their business. I fully understand if they're slammed and running around, but a \""we'll be right with you\"" goes a long way and we didn't get any of that. We just got blown off. We were all hungry and this was totally unacceptable. We left and went down the street to Venezia's. They were friendly and wanted our business."
0,"If I could give them 0 stars I would. Called for an oil change from the parking lot and was told there was no wait, when I walked in literally less than a minute later they told me there was a 2 hour wait. Jeremy was ride and had no interest in helping me. They DIDN'T rotate like my tires like they were supposed to and were shady about it when I asked them about it. Instead of the price they had listed there were arbitrary fees that made it almost $10 more. Their employees were grimy, shady and not at all courteous or pleasant. I will not be back and will be calling their corp office. What a horrible experience."
2,"great place to have your battery recharged. they require that you bring your own oil back to the recycle bin... which is gross and impossibly filthy. i really can't leave this place without getting dirty. but hell, i really can't complain. i like getting dirty."
4,"One of my new favorite haunts. The good thing about living at Mill & Southern is a great bar selection within a block or so, OK so I'm into dive bars, it's almost heaven. The first time I went into the Timeout, it reminded me of a hundred bars back home in Pittsburgh. I didn't feel alot of personality the first couple times, not until I met and made some friends. It's a bar that plays pool, as you can see by all the trophy's and the bulletin board cluttered with league info. I'm a casual player so it's a little intimidating at first, but everyone there is great. That's the allure; the people. You can't look around and see it in the fixtures, it's the conversations, the eclectic hair, the young, the old, the ones with blue chalk wiped on their pants and spilling PBR as they giggle away. The bartenders are fun and easy on the eyes-Daddy Like!\nAND, last but not least, I dig the jukebox and the tunes that get downloaded, alot of punk, new wave and other tunes that I grew up loving."
4,"With family in upstate New York, I grew up with trips to Ted's while visiting back east.  The charcoal grilled hot dogs always tasted sooo good.  \n\nIn high school, I discovered that Ted's had a location in Tempe, only a bit away from my parent's house in Mesa.  The yumminess of the food definitely translated west of the Mississippi.  Everything is so good and has that awesome taste of being grilled and perhaps fried (like the fries and onion rings)  without being too heavy.\n\nI love standing in line, calling out my order when asked, buying Weber's mustard (I haven't found it sold anywhere else in Arizona), drinking fountain rootbeer that has a kick, looking at the Buffalo, NY paraphenalia that decorates the walls. \n\nOn the trays, there is a paper with a quiz that I pretty much have memorized.  I know, from the quiz, that Ted's uses 7 million pickle spears per year.  I also always laugh with my friends over the easiest question on the quiz: \""True or False; there is a Ted's Hotdogs location in Tempe, AZ\"" (the quiz was clearly written for my Ted's friends to the east).\n\nIt gets pretty crowded at lunchtime and stays that way through the afternoon.  I would suggest going slightly before noon or after 2:30pm."
3,"I have always had an excellent lunch at Ted's - not necessarily the healthiest - but excellent!  It is easy to be intimidated in front of the lunch crowd when the cook is asking for your order across a line of hungry patrons - but it keeps the line rolling, and you get your food fast (without it quite being such fast food!).  All the dogs I've had there were excellent (never tried anything else - why would I - it's Ted's HOT DOGS!)."
2,"I thought this place was really good for what it is. I don't really understand all the awards and hype for it though... In the end it's just a hot dog to me. I enjoyed my regular hot dog with mustard, onions, sauerkraut, and a pickle. I have to say the real star of the meal was the onion rings! They were unfortunately very addicting. We got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was delicious."
3,"Ted's Hot Dogs is a fun place to have lunch.  It's kind of a nostalgic sort of place with memorabilia on the walls.  You will feel like you've gone back to a simpler time when you eat at Ted's.  My favorite is the All Beef hot dog but they also serve hamburgers, french fries, onion rings, milk shakes, etc...  I would have given Ted's 5 Stars but their bathroom is too small for all of the crowds they get here. Hard to get a seat here if you know what I mean.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed! Just make sure you use the facilities at home before you go."
0,"Unfortunately something isn't the same - I can't put my finger on it, but the service and food has changed from what Ted's used to be- even at the Buffalo NY locations. It doesn't feel like a family owned business and the employees just don't seem to care. The hot dogs also taste different that they were 20 years ago- cutting costs?"
4,"Ted's is hands down my favorite place to eat hotdogs! Go during lunch hour and you may be standing in line for a little while but it's well worth the wait. Great service along with great food and decent portions, you can't go wrong."
2,Disappointed as I was told this was one of the BEST hot dogs ever.  We got an all beef and white hot.  Not the worse hot dogs we've had but not the best.  They do however have REALLY GOOD onion rings!
0,"I typically use Arizona Import Specialists in Tempe, AZ. Unfortunately; I had a gas line bust on one of my dual tanks. It was a Saturday so I used my AAA road side assistance (12 year member) to have it towed to The Car Shop. With the great reviews and the AAA recommendations I did not hesitate to have the work completed on my 1987 V-10 Custom Deluxe. They completed the work in a timely fashion. After I pick up the vehicle I filled the tank with gas and it didn't work. I took my truck back and they reviewed their work and the manager informed me that the switch was malfunctioning. I asked if they had tested it after the \""repair\"" work was complete. They said, \""No\"". It is common practice to test something that has been fixed. I spoke with the manager and we had a disagreement about what was wrong with the truck. He refused to fix it and wanted to charge me an additional $200.00 to fix something I already paid him to fix ($326.00). Needless to say I took my truck back to my original mechanic and they solved the problem right away. Problem resulting in a kinked hose - the one they replace. The arrogance and dishonesty from the manager was nothing short of a disappointment. I understand the dynamics of the repair and was willing to work out our differences but this man insisted the malfunction was not caused by the work he had done. This is a great example of a shop with great technicians/mechanics and terrible management.     \n\nyours truly,\n1987 Chevy Truck \nNM"
1,"One hot Arizona evening my mom and I were wondering around Tempe looking for decorations for a float for an upcoming parade when we happened upon several restuants in a row... not knowing where to go, the only thing my mom could say was \""Anywhere but Manuel's!\"" I started to read off the different signs and she said, oh! let's try Rice King... ummm... sure I said. \n\nWe entered the DESERTED dining room around 5:30 PM, in the middle of what normally is the dinner time rush... but not a soul in sight - NOT a good sign! We went through their mini gauntlet of fake plants and approached the counter infront of a VERY old sign displaying their menu. Straight out the 80s. Old worn out photos of their signature dishes were warped and dingy looking. I honestly had a positive outlook, I was hoping for the best and gladly ordered the Lemon Chicken and my mom ordered the Cashew Nut Chicken from the nice Chinese man who ran the place.\n\nWe paid our $18 for our meals, got our drinks and sat down. I would like to say that Rice King's food is where the old meets the new. Not old traditions meet new techniques and fresh ingredients... more like... old ingredients meet old techniques drenched in newly thinned out sauce. *shudders* \n\nFirst came our egg drop soup served in a small styraphone cup. It was lukewarm... like a single serving of incubation soup. It had a decent flavor but when I bit into one pea... it was disgusting! I couldn't take it! It tasted like the once frozen pea had freezer burn! My mom quit eating hers after two bites and I got through it all except for the peas.\n\nNext came our meals. Check the pictures for how the looked... it was a big plate of beige. The Lemon chicken would have been decent but the sauce was old and gloopy and not very hot. The chicken itself was an old filet but the batter was nice and light and crispy. I started to just eat the crispy skin. The rice was hardening and hosted more of the freezer burned peas. It was slightly peppery again, would have been good if it were freshly made. The eggroll was the best part of the meal... if only it were larger than my thumb! The sweet & sour sauce it came with was watered down so much it was literally flavorless. However it did come with some friend wontons which gave a nice crunch to things. \n\nThe cashier was friendly, which earned them another star. But man, the food was baaaad. We only finished it because we were starving! When we left we wished we had gone to Manuel's after all!"
1,"I really try to support local business and really tried to like this place. I even went a few times, thinking the next time would be better. The last time I went I spent 7 bucks on what was old, cold, nasty lemon chicken. I really, really wanted to like this place. After my last experience, I won't go back."
2,"If you want some quick, affordable, and tasty chinese take-out in Tempe than this place is reliable.  I've only been coming here for a short time now and never had any problems.  Just don't have any high expectations for something less than 6-7 dollars for a meal and you'll arrive home happy and full."
1,"First off, I realize that this is a school and with this knowledge I thought I would try it out. \n\nThe waiting room is a sad sad sight. I knew that the low price would bring in some questionable elements from the diversity of our society, but not this weird of a selection. Many old people.\n\nI came on a Saturday shortly after 8, thinking I was on the ball.. but I wasn't. I had almost an hour wait, but I was prepared to wait so that is all on me. One female looking confident and professional came out with a smile and said a name. Not my name. It's a shame because she had everything I was looking for in a massage therapist. \n\nShortly thereafter a woman comes out, and meekly states my name. I immediately get a bad feeling but I shake it off. I am here as an evaluator and just trying to see what this place have to offer. I ask her how long she has been doing this and she says she is halfway through the program. She asks me if there are any areas I want her to focus on and I say it would be great if she could focus on shoulders and the base of my skull. Nothing odd there right?\n\nAfter this comes close to an hour of really awkward pushing and poking. It was clear that my therapist didn't know what she was doing, and didn't have the confidence of doing it. She spends just as much time massaging, as she was correcting the sheets, towels and other stuff OCD style. It was really bad.\n \nAnother thing worth mentioning, she gave me possibly the best massage of my pectorals I have ever got... but then again spent almost no time on my shoulders, and didn't touch my neck, skull, shoulder blades or anything else that actually needed some attention. (Funny that she asked initially, but maybe that was just a box to check?!)\n\nConclusion: I realize that it must be hit and miss regarding what therapist you get, and therefore what experience you might have. In my case it was a miss. I will give this place one more chance."
0,"set the scene- \n\nparty of 5 staying at the hotel for business \n\nmore then half empty restaurant\nhalf to wait a half hour for a table that could accommodate us\nsat at ginormous table\nwaiter comes by after we sit, of course we are not ready at this point, dont see her again for a whole 20 minutes\norder 2 bottles of wine, salads, entrees\nsalad was good but certainly would not classify that dressing as caesar\nentrees - lets just say that not one person felt that they could not prepare their food better, at home  pretty sure my mashed potatoes were powdered  \n\nhad a better meal the next night in the lobby bar"
1,"Really, the appeal is the view, which is fantastic.  The food was ok.  The atmosphere was ok."
2,It was nice to relax for dinner on night this week and if you want to relax this is the place to do it at.  The view is just amazing and the staff was very friendly.  I had the Rib eye steak and it was cook just perfect.  Blue cheese potatoes were really good but I think the Blue Cheese was a bit over powering for the potatoes.\n\nI also had some cake for desert but the ice cream  had started to melt and the cake was a bit dry.  For the price I expected a bit better on the details like that.  In the end it was worth the trip for the view.
0,"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. The food was terrible, if you like something like church's chicken  you might approve. We ordered the prawn appetizer; there were 3 1/2 sized  prawns fried and skewered sitting on a GREASY OIL SOAKED napkin with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce on the side....happy hour priced @ $9.00. The 2nd  appetizer was their cieviche of which ive seen similar representation in the deli department at Albertsons.....not impressive at all, and it was served in a 4oz mason jar with crackers laid out on a plate like Grandma would serve, also $9.00 happy hour priced.  Eeeeeek! The drinks were also unimpressive, the dirty martini had oils floating on top and the supposed blue cheese olive was a creamy cheap imitation  @ $15.00 ea including the tax! We had to ask the waiter twice for napkins, by the time he brought them we had finished the 3 measly greasy shrimp! Sadly, the best part of the outing were the mints at the door on the way out. Never, never, never! What a gigantic disappointment!"
1,I was surprised that a resort could be so mediocre.  Here's my take (and I stay here rather regularly due to business travel):\n\n+ Cookies at your bedside in the evenings\n+ Complimentary bottle of water \n+ Shower is awesome\n+ Pool is extra huge and relaxing\n- Decor is so 1980s/1990s\n- Insects are pretty common here for some reason. Yesterday I had to kill some small flying thing.\n- Driving from the lobby to the rooms.  This was a little confusing when I first came here.\n- No special amenity for Silver or Gold members.  Only Platinum members get special stuff.
2,"Like it. Typical desert summer staff, but I thought the service was OK enough. Not 4 or 5 star.\nBeds and rooms, pretty good.\nWarning!! They smoke on the property. Might jujst be an AZ thing, but ALL Marriott properties in the US are supposed tro be non-smoking. How this one gets away with it, I jave no idea. Just a word of caution.\nLove the way it is built in to the hill. Might not be good place for handicapped or elderly. Plenty of stairs and walking. Neither bother me too much.\nBreakfast is typical Marriott.\nIf price is good, book it, you won't be sorry. Good spot for business travelers, as it is close to that area."
2,"I was there for three days last week for a work conference, so I can't really speak to what my experience would have been had I just been there on vacation. But... Here's what I experienced:\n\nThe good: My bed was comfy. The pool (even though I didn't get to use it) looked awesome. I know others enjoyed it. I was offered an Arnold Palmer as soon as I stepped into the lobby, which was nice. The staff was friendly. \n\nThe not-so-good: No tub in my room. Seriously? No bathtub? I mean, the shower was big... but it's a hotel. Unless I'm staying at the YMCA Youth Hostel, I generally expect a tub in my room. The carpets in the conference center smelled musty and moldy and like old cleaning chemicals. Not pleasant, at all, especially when you're sitting in conference rooms for hours at a time. The food. Honestly, this could have been my biggest issue, so I'm going to go into more detail.\n\nThe Buttes is a popular place for weddings. Some of the views are great, so I can see how some might see it as a great place to gather. But if the food they gave us was anything like the food they offer at weddings, I'd NEVER use it. \n\nAt the conference we had colleagues from all over the country; Florida, Texas, Ohio, Arizona and Pittsburgh. I blame all the whiteys from the east coast for our food the first night. I think the chefs saw that the majority of the people with us were from out of town and wouldn't know good Mexican food if it bit them. So what we got resembled Mexican food in name only. We were served rice, beans, shredded beef, chicken fajitas, shrimp fajitas, with taco shells and tortillas to put it all into. The rice was red, but tasted like nothing. The shredded beef had zero flavour. No salt, nothing. It was literally the blandest meat I'd ever had. The chicken and shrimp fajitas were so overpowered with bell peppers that they tasted like a microwave meal. The salsas were bland and flavourless, which complimented the meal perfectly. .... Dessert was disappointing too, except for the tres leches cake. It wasn't great, but it was definitely the best thing of the whole spread. \n\nThe food the rest of the time I was there pretty much followed suit. Bland, flavourless. Runny eggs for breakfast. Dry 30-hour roast beef. Some of the desserts weren't too bad, but even then they seemed like they were packaged, not made in house. For instance, the flan looked, and tasted, like little piles of pudding on top of Smucker's caramel sauce. I don't think there was anything that I can say, \""Oh yeah! That was awesome!\"" Truly disappointing. \n\nAll in all, I don't know that I would make it a 4 star resort. 3 stars maybe. I don't think I'd go back unless someone else was footing the bill. There are other places in town, comparable prices, better amenities, that I'd rather frequent."
2,"Spring Training stay with hubby and 13 month old \nThis is a do it yourself, be on your own hotel, what I mean is after check in you're pretty much on your own\nAs a mom when I think vacation I think other people doing the work, not the case \nAfter checking in you get back in your car, drive down the hill, locate your room, then unload and carry in your bags\nWe brought our own play pen and highchair since we've experienced issues in the past, we requested a fridge and booked a single king room\nThe room was spacious although the hallways were a bit musty \nFYI this hotel does NOT have tubs in any of its rooms so we had to shower with our little guy\nAfter unpacking we decided we wanted to go out to eat and check out the hotel layout, the only options on the property were the pool grill or top of the rock resturant, what we found was an outdoor bar you could order food at while drunks smoke cigars a table away from you and a restaurant that is not child friendly and pricey\nWe ended up at top of the rock and after 15 minutes the restaurant was able to scrounge up a highchair, the food was decent, hubby had the steak (which I thought tasted like liquid smoke) and I had the pot roast which still had string on it and served with veggies drenched in sauce, they didn't have an actual kids menu but the waitress was able to get us a small serving of mac n cheese and fruit for our little guy\nWe ordered room service for breakfast, decent price and yummy and ate at the buffet another morning, buffets a better deal at $16 with an omelette and waffle bar \nWe went to the pool around 6pm, it was dead and the water was freezing, the jacuzzis are nice but you feel like a mountain goat running up and down the hillside to get to them or your towels\nOn the way back from a game a staff member flagged us down and offered us a ride back up the hill, on the ride he mentioned they do it all day during Spring training, although it was the first time hearing about it \nThe fact the stadium is within walking distance is about the only thing that would get me to stay here again \nThey should really consider a more family friendly dining option (even if its just seasonal)"
1,"The fried chicken wings are good.  The rest?  Below par Chinese MSG.  I might get some wings sometime, but the rest of the food is below mediocre."
0,"The food and customer service were literally worse than I have ever experienced in my entire life! \n\nI went for dinner around 4:30pm on a Saturday. Nearly all of the trays on the buffet were empty. What was left was cold, but I didn't know that until it was on my plate. When I got back to my table I had a bite of orange chicken, which was stone cold. The white rice was hard and cold. I pushed my plate to the side while I debated what to do. One of the waitresses came over and asked if I'd like a drink refill, even though I had only drunk about a third of the glass of soda. I declined and explained that my guest and I were going to be leaving because the food was horrible, but it would be great if we could get a refund. Laney came over and said she'd refund half, but later agreed to refund me for both my meal and my guest's meal, which was as cold and stale as mine. When she came back, Laney presented me with a new receipt for $4, citing that there was nothing wrong with the sodas we ordered. While that was true, I explained I believed that was horribly petty since my guest had drunk none of his soda and I had so little of mine -- and the point of the drinks were to enjoy them with our meals. The man, whom I assume to be Laney's brother, came over and was very apologetic, refunded all of my money and offered to cook us fresh food  free of charge to learn how good his fresh cooking was (We declined.), but he didn't seem to think there was a problem with having cold and stale food on the buffet line. \n\nLong story short, I think that China Farm uses quality ingredients and may very well produce good food when cooked to order, but don't count on getting an edible meal at the buffet. The orange chicken was all white meat and the beef and broccoli my guest had was made with quality looking beef and vegetables ... just cold."
3,Excellent prices and the people working there are friendly. CLEAN inside unlike other Mexican rest's in the area. The taste of the food is at top game and love eating at this place!
4,"No pressure, honest, laid back, personable salespeople!  I drove in from CA to buy a used TSX and they did as much as possible beforehand to make the transaction smooth and quick.  They also let me privately sell my old car on their premises (and even encouraged doing so) because they couldn't give me much on the trade."
0,"Please save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else.  This is by far the WORST Acura dealership I've ever dealt with and they obviously don't care about their customers or getting their customers business. \n\nI walked into the dealership and asked an employee (who it turned out worked in the service department) to direct me to the service department.  I waited at the front desk where he sent me for someone to help me, while I did no less than 5 service department employees (including the one who directed me) stood around in a gaggle even occasionally making direct eye contact with me.  None of them bothered to give me the time of day so I took the initiative and went to the cashier's desk to seek assistance from the women sitting there.  I followed this women outside where she went to seek answers from the other employees.  Afterwards she came back to me and proceeded to chastise and blame me for not being helped.  Her logic was that I didn't receive service because I parked my car in the service department's parking lot and walked inside to get help instead of driving it into the entrance of the service garage.  Seriously?!?!?  There is NO sign that says \""If you need an oil change drive your car into unintuitive location and if you don't we won't bother to help you instead we'll stand around with our hands in our pockets\"".  If that sign existed I would partial agree with her rebuke.\n\nSo let me sum this up:  I parked in the most intuitive place I could find, received instructions from an employee who then systematically ignored me, then when I sought help from a different employee I was ridiculed in front of the rest of the employees who failed to help me in the first place."
0,Was in there picking up my items as the older guy sat there talking trash about their customers. Also overheard in his conversation was a threat to take them outside and beat them up for complaining - as I looked at my messed up stitching... Will never go there again.
0,"I'm usually not one to write reviews, but my stay here was so awful I feel obligated to warn other travelers. I booked a stay here and it cost me $83 a night with tax. When I arrived the property seemed to look nice and safe. When I went to check in I was informed that I would be given a smoking room and was informed that was all they had available. My trip was non refundable so I didn't mind. When I got in the room the carpets and towels were dirty looking and the furniture was outdated. Before I went to bed that night I had found a used syringe underneath the mattress (I always check my rooms for bed bugs).The next morning I had informed the hotel manager that I had found a syringe and I was offered a half a** apology and was basically told I was the travel website's problem. I wasn't offered a refund or any sort of compensation for my bad experience. In short the place is a total rip off and a dump. I will never stay at a Day's Inn again."
0,"The only reason I go to Walmart if either because I was some crap that's dirt cheap or I need a fishing license. Well, it's that time of the year again to get that license! Dropped by later at night when my other errands were over, spent about 5 minutes with the licensing guy, but he said I had to pay up front since he closed his register (10:30PM). He told me I had to go to register 15, too. Now this license for all water ways with trout stamp and two pole stamp was about $60.00, and it was in my hand. A less honest man would've just left but not me. \n\nI wish I had. There were three people in front of me in lane 15 (NO ONE in other lanes), and it took 30 minutes. It was because 1. I was in the only cigarette line! 2. The cashier was very slow. 3. The drawer was not well stocked and she called for change every two minutes.\n\nI got home at 11:15PM, and I am glad my fishing license is good until 2010!!!"
2,"I normally wouldn't even think to review a Walmart store because historically I've DESPISED them!  But, recently, I discovered a Walmart - This Walmart - And have had a change of heart (so to speak).  I find this Walmart to be free from 'Walmartians' (or at least I haven't witnessed any while I've been in there) and the staff is actually helpful and pleasant....That's right, you read that correctly....Helpful and pleasant - They don't appear to DESPISE their jobs and lives as much as I use to despise Walmart as law.  Additionally, I find this store to be quite clean and well stocked with inventory, which is a bonus!  So there you have it.....A Walmart store within the State of Arizona which is acceptable and not a challenge to even think about entering into. \n\nHappy Shopping!"
0,"If I could give zero stars I would. My boyfriend and I purchased a vacuum from there approximately two montha ago. We have used the vacuum a handful of times. Today, the vacuum literally sparked, smoked, and nearly caught the carpet on fire. I immediately called Walmart, spoke with Kathy, and she said it would be no problem that I did not have a receipt or box, it could be returned. I go to return it, get a new vacuum in exchange, and head to customer service. The lady at customer service was excellent. The real problem came when she needed to get her supervisor for approval. After calling him twice and waiting twenty minutes, he arrived! He told us we would be unable to return it, only exchange it for the same one. Umm, why would I want the same vacuum that nearly caught my floor on fire? We explained that we wete prepared to spend nearly $70 on a different vacuum, and he said no, I can't help you. Did not offer any apologies, any suggestions, any help. Just no. We asked to speak to another \""manager\"" and after another 10 minutes she arrived. While playing with her phone and not even looking at us, she gave me the same response. No apologies. Just walked away. I am thoroughly disappointed and extremely angry. Kenneth and Amanda provided me with the worst customer service I have ever had. I've never written a review ever. But these two inexperienced, unapologetic, rude supervisors rubbed me the wrong way. Never again will I step foot in that store."

3,"Nice, clean, friendly, and close to home.  And they don't charge a fortune.  Can't complain!  I'll be back :)"
4,This is one of the best nail salons I've been to around the area and for a very reasonable price! The owner Su is amazing and will make sure that you are satisfied with what you have. They really take pride in what they do and care about the costumers. What really stands out and keeps me coming back to this salon is that if they don't know or don't feel comfortable at doing a design they will call someone who can do it! This is a great place to treat yourself at! \n\nAlso Lanny one of the techs here does amazing work!! She's really talented at designs.
1,"Took my wife here last week with flu symptoms, it wasn't very busy but it still took about an hour and a half before we left. The wait time was okay considering there was only one doctor for the whole place. The nurse was not overly friendly as she asked all the questions that we already filled out on their forms. I suppose the establishment serves its purpose when you can't get in to see your primary care doctor."
0,"I would not go back to this place, even though it is close. It looks run down and dirty inside, both in the waiting areas and exam rooms. I did not feel very confident in the skills or assessment done by the doctor or the staff. It seemed quick and not very thorough."
0,"Incompetent and unprofessional.  I took my car in because it developed a miss, the kind typical of something wrong with the ignition system.  I specifically asked if they did computer diagnostics and they assured me they did.  They called me later with the results - said it needed the carburetor rebuilt for around $400.  I went over to pick up the car and decide what to do.  I asked to see a printout of the computer diagnostic so i could see if the ignition system had checked out OK.  He didn't have a printout.  When I asked more about their \""computer system\"" his answers got really weaselly.  I paid them the Diagnostic fee.  I didn't believe them and took the care to a different shop that I like but that was much farther away to have them check it.  They checked and said the problem was a bad spark plug that was all fouled and showed me the plug, it was a mess.  They had put in a new plug to replace it and they car ran fine.  They said it would probably foul it again because the valve stem seals were leaking.  They also said there was nothing wrong with the carburetor and the car ran great when I drove away.   I went back to the Shell station with the results and asked to speak to the owner.  Supposedly he wasn't there.  I came back later and the same guy was there and I finally pinned him down to at least admit he was in charge and showed him the results from the second shop and explained that with the 1 new $2 plug the problem was fixed.  Asked him how such a clearly bad plug, which I showed him, would not have literally jumped off the computer screen of his \""computer diagnostics\"".  He just try to BS his way around without answering.  I told him I thought they owed me my money back for their \""diagnosis\"" since it was so clearly wrong.  He refused to even consider it.    I wouldn't trust this place to wash my windows much less do any work on my car."
4,"I'm 4'11\"" and there is not one single pair of pants at any store that I can wear right off the rack unless the store carries a \""short\"" length.  After finally getting fed up with hemming (if you can call it that) my own pants, and then tripping when my heels get caught in my bad hem job, I decided that I make a decent enough living and can afford to pay a tailor to do it right.\n\nWasn't sure where to go, so my first thought was Delia's Cleaners, since they have a sign that says they do alterations. While I do make a decent living, I do a lot of second-hand-clothes shopping, so I was not about to pay $12 to hem some pants that cost me $8.00. And then I read some reviews about this and the reviews didn't inspire much confidence in the quality of the service I'd be getting for that.\n\nAs I drove out of the Safeway shopping plaza where Delia's is located, I noticed a small \""alterations\"" place across the street: A Stitch in Time. Coincidence? I think not. Fate is more like it.\n\nAnd \""fate\"" is part of her name: FATEMEH! She is awesome! I walked in there with a large bag full of all the pants I ever hemmed badly or rolled up. At least 8 pants on that first visit. \n\nFatemeh had me try each one on, and she quickly put some pins into one leg of each pair of pants. She asked me when I needed them back, and when I said by this time next week (expecting her to say no way, or that 'll cost ya) she said OK! Not a problem. \n\nI was worried because I didn't even check for references or anything and had just driven up there. So this was a big leap of faith with almost all the pants I own. \n\nI was THRILLED when I got them back. Every single one of them was a perfect fit, and the stitching was excellent. Not only that, she ironed all of them! Those poor pants hadn't had face-time with a good pressing in a looong time! \n\nWhat's more, Fatemeh was so grateful for the business. She thanked me an awkward number of times during the 5 or 6 minutes I was there to pick up my items. I thought it was maybe because there were so many and it was a big bill, but she was just the same with the other people who were there as well. I say it was awkward because I rarely encounter a business owner who THANKS customers or clients, as most people act so entitled or like you owe them something. It was refreshing. She just genuinely appreciates her clients. \n\nWell Fatemeh, this client genuinely appreciates you, too. I appreciate her so much I have been a repeat customer at least 6 more times in the past 8 months."
4,"Had to get my tire repaired,  unfortunately it was not able to be repaired. The tires I have are not made anymore even though they are only 1 year old. They said they would look for my tire at another Discount Tire. They found it and had it delivered to this location. It came the next day. I made an appointment to have the tire changed. I was very late for my appointment and apologized.  When I got there Josh was waiting for me they took my truck back immediately and I was done in literally 10 min. I was so grateful and amazed they took care of me so quickly.  I always have gone to this discount tire.  And will continue to go there. They are wonderful!"
1,"Cowboys and gangsters and mechanical bull riding and cheap booze and wet  shirt contests and random concerts and beer tub girls in ass-less chaps. How can you fuck this up? Graham Central Station is so ridiculous that it should be awesome.\n\nBut it isn't. Somehow. HOW?\n\nThis place is a huge mess. Every person in here frightens me. \n\nI guess  you could get totally hammered and try to ignore the scariness and really party here. But I can't do it.\n\nBut I dare YOU to do it. If you do go here, please tell us alllllllll about it."
2,"Read about Graham's awhile ago when I was looking for a club with an 80's night. Found this place and have been here a few times since. Three stars for a few reasons. The dress code can be pretty lousy. I understand hats and baggy clothes but sleeveless shirts? Also, the 80's room doesn't play enough actual 80's music, mostly a mix with lots of 90's stuff. Lastly, the bartenders can be hit or miss; don't come here and expect to get a scotch on the rocks or an old fashioned. That being said, this place is still awesome because there are three themed areas, drinks aren't to pricey and the crowd is always fun and unusual. Don't miss out on the shots from the test tubes; they'll do the trick."
0,"These guys are a total fraud. I had a problem with the starter in my car and I towed it here. They fixed it with glue and charged me USD500 (claiming that they replaced it). Within less than a year the starter gaveup and I towed my car back to Midas (since the starter was under one year warranty). They did not honour the warranty and they gave me absurd reasons. \n\nI have never been to these fraudulent people after that. DOnt take your car hear, if you want to get a \""real\"" repair done."
0,"I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast \""elites\"" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) \n\nWhy they let me play, I'll never know:)\n\nLast evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)\n\nIt was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a \""Rodgering\"":)\n\nSo it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)\n\nWhere to start...I know...the parking lot:)\n\nWhen we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)\n\nAfter I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than \""regal\"" atmosphere:)\n\nThey must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)\n\nThe smell in S&J can only be described as \""extreme humanity\""...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)\n\nS&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on \""tap\"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or \""boofay\"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.\n\nIt was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)\n\nS&J provided a table full of taco \""fixin's\""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(\n\nThey told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground \""creature\""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.\n\nI kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, \""beef\""...just not very good \""beef\"":(\n\nThe hot tray holding the \""meat\"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of \""meat\"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(\n\nBut, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.\n\nI decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(\n\nI got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(\n\nOne of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not \""broiled\""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)\n\nThen they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(\n\nAdding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)\n\nStill, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).\n\nThey say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)"
3,"I really love playing pool here.  Some of the other reviewers seem to think it's in a bad neighborhood or something,  but I have never seen anything really sketchy happen there. Just seems like your run of the mill strip mall to me.  There is kind of a rowdy parking lot crowd on the weekends since Graham Central Station is in the parking lot , but nothing too crazy.  The staff there are very friendly and helpful and always check on you to make sure you are doing a okay.\n\nThey have a very large number of pool tables to play on hourly and per game.  Are they shiny and new? No not at all, but I like the \""Color of Money\"" neighborhood pool hall feel.  The few times I have encountered a loose pocket or something off with a table it's been fixed the next time I go in.\n\nThe hourly pool rates and food prices are very reasonable and the service is great.  Try the Onion Rings and the Sundae :) you won't regret it.  The other bar food they have is nothing new or different, but very good by bar standards.  \n\nI would have given this place 5 stars, but they have 3 nights a week they do pool leagues so you can't play during those times.  Which is cool I should probably join a pool league anyway.\n\nIf you play pool you should go in and have some fun."
3,This place is ok
4,"This gym has spoiled me. They have all the right classes at all the right times. even when it's packed, there's always an open machine. sometimes there's a wait for the weight machines. the  locker rooms are always super clean. and the staff is just awesome. totally worth the $50 membership!"
4,"Yes!  It's twice as pricey as Gold's or LA Fitness... but it's twice as awesome!  You get what you pay for at Lifetime.  As someone who goes to the gym over my lunch break, I couldn't ask for anything more from a gym.  It's the little things; you don't need to bring a towel, soap, a locker key or lunch!  The caf\u00e9 has a nice selection of healthy meals for breakfast, lunch, kids and even smoothies and the nutrition facts are on the menu.   As a vegetarian, there are several options for me to choose from.   The equipment from the cardio machines to the pool is well maintained and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  After being spoiled with Lifetime for over 3 years, I honestly could never switch gyms, call me a snob ... I don't care!"
4,"Best gym ever. They have so much here its crazy. If you want a gym that more than just a \""gym\"" come here. I have been with my personal trainer Max for a year and love it. \n\nI would highly recommend to anyone."
0,"Lifetime sells the spa as an incentive to the gym, along with the kids play area. The customer service at the spa was horrendous today. Jilian at lifetime spa has hands down worst customer service I have experienced in a long time.  Canceling appt, eye rolling, deep breathing to convey her frustrations. Don't work with ppl if you do not like the public."
0,Beware of this gym!!! I put my membership on hold because of an injury and they said I still owe them money. I finally said OK and went into pay and canceled my account. I received an email for another bill that was still owe. They told me I didn't sign something. I said the employee never ask me to sign something. Oh well they are very unwilling to work with someone and are very RUDE!!!! I will tell as many people as I know to never use Lifetime because there service lacks any kind of common sense.
0,The GM at the Tempe location is absolutely horrible and has no clue what he's doing.. He's a baffoon and was supposed to be fired a long time ago
4,I've been going to Lani for a while and she is always laughing and smiling. She makes you feel comfortable right away. She has great prices and you can tell she cares a lot. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
2,"Leftovers.  The food was so good here that we all were thinking about our leftovers-can't wait to eat this stuff again tomorrow!\n\nThe place does need to shake the old people feel.\n\nThe service at John Henry's was first rate, very attentive without being a bother.  My wife had a steak topped with blue cheese. I had Orichietta (pasta) which had a nice garlic infused cream sauce with prosciutto, onions and peas.  The kids had seafood pasta and a Knocchi with a Bolognes (SP) sauce.  We all loved the food.  They have a nice wine list and recommended a tasty Malbec to compliment our meals.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice if a little dated.  The staff and manager Adam are very helpful and friendly.  All in all, we're looking forward to a return trip here.\n\nLive music after 7 on weekends.  (I think it was 7)"
1,"Right off the bat I want to admit that when it comes to Chinese food I'm spoiled. I've traveled to Asia number of times, eaten a lot in San Francisco, and explored the Chinese restaurants in Phoenix for a lot of years. I have learned to expect a more \""authentic\"" type of Chinese food--the type of place that is frequented by actual Chinese people.\n\nStill, I love these little family run places so we checked this place out, hoping for the best. I wanted to like it, but I just did not like the food. The crispy chicken chow mien noodles were the type you get out of a can or bag, not the real thing. The other items were pretty standard Chinese-American fare. Honestly, I like Panda better, and it is cheaper. My stepson loved the shrimp though--said it was the best he has had since living in the US, so your mileage may vary. \n\nOthers have enjoyed this place. The service is friendly and they deliver if you live in the general area. Portions are very large. If you are not expecting a lot you might like it better."
4,I went to Just For You to get a wax and I was SO nervous! I saw Tamye and she made me feel so comfortable.  I was pleasantly surprised at how painless it was.  She was so amazing and I'll definitely be back.  Thank you so much Tamye!!
4,"When I think of this salon, I think clean, friendly and overall great!  I have been seeing Sylvia (esthetician) for a couple of years.  She is fast, efficient, friendly and knowledgeable.  I get my waxing done here and I recommend Sylvia to every one of my friends and family.  Call in advanced to get an appointment set and then they have a discount if you book for the next time in advanced.  There is a yelp check in deal for brazilian wax that is to die for... just sayin"
0,"This updated review is a direct reflection of the massage portion of my recent visit to Just For You.  My best friend was in town so we decided to treat ourselves to the Half Day Package. I provided this feedback and after a week, I have heard nothing.  I have amended some content due to character limits here: \n\n     I was so pleased with Heather's technique (during the facial portion of the appointment) and the session was a raging success from my perspective.  I was extremely relaxed when my facial was over and I was invited into the massage room by Allison.  \n\n     As a Licensed Massage Therapist myself, I do have some expectations for a massage session and understand every therapist is different and no two sessions are the same. Unbeknownst to me, my best friend had already told Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist; I did not share with Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist myself and I did not know that she had already been told.  I did not want her to feel like I would be \""testing\"" her in any way. With that in mind, I climbed onto the quite high massage table and settled in for what I was hoping would be a therapeutic session as \""Allison specializes in stress reduction, sports massage, and relaxation massage.\""  I work two jobs and had not received bodywork in almost a year.  \n\n     I can best summarize the session by sharing that Heather had a more therapeutic and relaxing touch than Allison did.  Allison talked for the first 10 minutes of what turned out to be a 45 minute (not an hour) session.  She seemed more interested in my main job title than in seeking feedback about her pressure.  Not wanting to jump the gun and to ensure I provided her ample time to check in regarding the pressure, I waited.  Allison proceeded to tell me by back was \""loosening up nicely\"" which was not an accurate statement in the least.  Allison kept moving over an area that was tense due to a poor sleeping position days earlier, something had I mentioned mid-session, and instead of applying direct pressure to ease that tension, she caused soreness and inflammation with the repeated palpation of the site.  After having me move into a supine position, Allison proceeded to begin an abdominal massage that felt very awkward and insecure.  To successfully conduct an abdominal massage, a towel or cloth heavier than the sheet already on the body should be used over the chest so when the sheet is pulled toward the feet to expose the abdomen, the client does not feel exposed.  Ideally, a conversation would have been had with the client regarding the area as it is not typically an area of the body where most people are comfortable receiving bodywork.  I am trained and experienced in abdominal massage and I found myself questioning what was happening before I realized that abdominal work was next.  Courtney shared with me that she, too, had felt awkward during this part of the session as she felt like she was just having her stomach rubbed and didn't really understand the purpose of the technique.  She also shared that she had asked Allison for more pressure during her session and Allison complied, providing more pressure for about a minute and then resuming her previous technique.    \n\n     To make matters more awkward, when we were at the front desk waiting to pay for our services, Allison stood there waiting for payment.  Heather and the other staff member at the desk were on the phone and Courtney and I were happy to wait for them to finish.  Allison even made mention that she didn't know how to finalize the payment portion of the visit but then attempted anyway, losing patience with the two servicing the clients on the phone.  When she was able, Heather apologized for the wait and we honestly had no issue waiting our turn.  When Allison decided to conduct the payment collection herself, I explained to her that we had had a package session that day.  She then gave us the total of $139 when the package price was $135.  I corrected her, even showing her the package I had already mentioned in the brochure, and she accepted our payments for $135.  It was only when it came time for us to add our tips and sign our receipts that Allison seemed to have an interest in our sessions and how we were feeling.  At that point, I just wanted to leave.  I was so utterly disappointed and honestly felt like I had wasted the money that paid for the massage portion of the package as there was nothing relaxing or therapeutic about what transpired during that session.  As we were leaving, Allison reminded us to \""drink lots of water\"" and I thought to myself, \""For what?\""  She didn't do anything that promoted a need for water in addition to what I already consume. \n\n     I wanted to bring my experience to your attention as I truly feel that, although her technique may be appreciated by some, it has confirmed that I will not be booking another massage session at Just For You."
1,"I don't think that I can add much to the already posted reviews, but here goes.\n\nGC is definitely the Walmart of music stores.  It's OK in a pinch, but you wouldn't want it as your mainstay music store.  Support the small shops whenever you can.\n\nThe one good thing about GC is the reason you don't really want to shop there, their return policy.  they'll take anything back.  Keep that in mind when you are buying something \""new\"" there.  Also, there are tons of people who don't know what they are doing going in there everyday and kicking the crap out of their gear.  If you buy something high on the wall or out of a glass case, you are probably relatively safe.\n\nProtip:  You can shop online and have stuff shipped to store and pick it up there, you can save a lot of money on shipping.\n\nProtip 2:  GC, GC.com, and Musician's Friend are all THE SAME thing."
0,"Horrible Safeway! I would recommend that no one goes to this Safeway location unless you absolutely have to. \n\nHonestly I don't even know where to start with these people Lol. I have had horrible experience personally and people have told me of even worse things. I will start with my own experiences. In short I was followed around the entire store by the manager... I even asked her what she was doing and she would not reply. It was completely out of left filed because I'm a 25 year old good look sharp dressed dude just looking for grocerys and a manager of the store is literally following my every step. I thought I was being punked... But I clearly wasn't. Interesting enough, I later find out from a Safeway employee that this lady is indeed the store manager and has some crazy Nazi type obsession with monitoring any and all minorities that enter the store. This woman has also been said to say extremely prejudice things in front of other employees. \n\nThis Safeway isn't worth your time or money! Trust me..."
2,Great place for big meals @ a great price!
3,"We went there on a Thursday night past 8 o'clock so we were seated quickly. The food was great, and so was the service was pretty good too. I would have given the place five stars, but halfway through dinner, an alarm went off and didn't get shut off for around five minutes. Also, one of the waiters (not ours) was trying to show off with some wine glasses and ended up dropping several due to a miscalculation. Practice makes perfect though. I didn't mind that so much but the alarm was a bit unnerving. I'm sure that wouldn't happen again though. I'll definitely go back."
3,"Great service, fast lunch on a work day."
2,"While I love the concept of the mongolian bbq restaurant, YC's is not even close to being a truly good one. The food is alright - you make your own stir-fry from the raw ingredients and the guys cook it up for you. \n\nThe service is great. Prompt seating, attentive wait staff, etc.\n\nBut where I really have beef (no pun intended) with this place, is with their meat selection. The raw meats and poultry are presented in this freeze-dried, thinly shaved manner, making it difficult to a) put enough in your plate, and b) really tell if it is good quality or crap meat.\n\nThe dessert - well, it's a frozen yogurt machine in the corner. \n\nI don't know - I guess I have been spoiled by BD's Mongolian in Ohio. Fresh meats, more upscale environment, and desserts beyond a frozen yogurt machine...\n\nEh.. I'd probably eat here again but only if I were in a group and the majority rule dictated it. I wouldn't choose to go there again given the choice."
0,down grading to a one star due to the fact that I have had a few people email me on here letting me know they too have gotten sick from this place! Eat at your own risk! Don't say I didn't warn you
3,"The food is fresh (except the meat, which is frozen, which is what knocked the place down a star) and the service is good. For around $9 you can have a bowl full of food, white or brown rice, soup, fried noodles and a drink. The place is clean and you can make your dish however you like."
2,Make your bowl. The place was big and clean. Very polite staff.
4,"Hands down 5 stars for this place. Whenever I visit Phoenix nowadays, this is a must go place!\n\nThe secret is a few scoops of curry sauce, few scoops of spicy thai, a dollop of garlic, a whole lot of dry pepper flakes, loads of veggies and a request to make it very well done....this place makes a mean stir fry!! I love it!! love it!! The problem is that I over eat and I am too sleepy to work afterwards."
1,I was passing through Phoenix when I was searching for an Indian restaurant and my GPS pointed me to this place. The ambiance is very ordinary and they could definitely do better job with it.  \n\nService was reasonably prompt. They didnt ask me for a spice level when they took my order. I found the food bland for my taste. Could have done with more spice and salt. The food is alright nothing out of the ordinary.
2,"I've been here a few times and its decent food. There is nothing special about this place that makes me want to specifically go back. Although, if someone is holding a party or special occasion here I doubt I would avoid this place.\n\nI've never been here just for lunch or dinner, so that may effect my review. Although, I've eaten this food on multiple occasions for events at the restaurant. Its good Indian food, and you can never say no to good Indian food. It just wasn't spectacular. I would give most Indian food places 5-stars if the quality of the meat they used was better and if the quality of everything they use is just better. The salads weren't green, the meat in the korma and tikka was very small. It just felt like they were cheaping out on us.\n\nDesserts weren't really special either. If you give me gulab jamun or some jelebi, I am a sucker for that stuff. Theirs was decent, but there wasn't much of it available. However, there really isn't much better stuff in AZ in this vicinity. I'd say India Gate is a little better, maybe try that place out first."
1,"With reviews ranging from 5 stars to 1...my wife and I decided to give it a try for our 3rd wedding anniversary dinner. Good thing she and I have a sense of humor because we needed it. \n\nFrom the cheesy bad decor, to the awful / skipping CD music and abysmal lighting, we wondered whether the food was so superb that some people chose to ignore the obvious deficits and gave this place a high rating. Uh, no. We were the only ones in the entire restaurant on a Wednesday night. That's right. The only ones and we were there for a couple hours and still the service was lacking. \n\nOn the plus side: They accepted our Restaurant.com discount coupon, which was good considering the other review I read about them choosing not honor one they felt didn't apply. The combination waitress/hostess/manager/(& chef?) also did not charge me for a glass of wine that was way passed its prime and smelled / tasted like vinegar, which again, was good service on their part. But the food was just ok. Not bad. Not superb. Just Ok.  \n\nProbably the most entertaining part of our meal was the suprise we received while eating our dinner. As we listened to the loud Indian music piped over our heads, we were quite suprised to hear the Hindi version of the Fergie's \""My Humps.\"" We actually stopped eating, looked at each other and burst out laughing.  I could just see a lady in a Sari singing about her humps, her humps, her lovely lady lumps...uh, what???\n\nAlso, it seemed like the proprieters were having a family dinner at one of the tables; complete with children doing homework.\n\nWe won't be going back and suggest you try somewhere else."
0,"I am completely disappointed in this establishment today. 30 minutes in the drive thru line. Then the kid was an ass when we asked what was taking so long, he said we are understaffed and busy! As we finally get to the window we wait 15 more minutes for 2 iced birthday cakes and a small watermelon! And look through the window as the staff are all just standing around looking at one another. I usually love this place but man it's summer in Az you think you would be staffed for these hot days!!!"
3,"I had read a few reviews about Bahama Bucks on Yelp and I've been wanting to try it for a while ... We finally made it in! After the first few bites of our shaved ice, we definitely felt like we've been missing out!\n\nWe ordered the small root beer float shaved ice & the regular passion fruit & mango shaved ice, both topped with cream. I'd say that on the normal day, the small is definitely plenty (might have even gone for the baby size) but the regular is great for an extra treat. I personally liked the passion fruit a little bit better than the mango but the combination definitely worked well together. I think for the one I got, I would've skipped the cream. It was good (definitely didn't take away from the passion fruit & mango flavor) but it wasn't so impressive that I want to pay the extra little bit for it again. When I had ordered, the man working who suggest it had said that with the passion fruit & mango, it could go either way & he was right.\n\nAs far as the service goes, it was constantly busy but there were quite a few people working so we got our order in & got our shaved ice very quickly. We were offered a punch card as well. Minus one star, however, because when we went to the counter when we first walked in, one of the guys working was rude. He looked highly annoyed when I said that I had never been in and wanted suggestions and actually walked away! Another guy who was right next to him quickly stepped up and was helpful in picking out flavors. It's a bit expensive but so delicious! We'll be back!"
1,"Yeah, I know, it's a Wendy's. What should I expect?\n\nHow about at least getting *something* right on my order? You know, *anything*.\n\nI order a grilled chicken sandwich, large fries, and a large chocolate frosty. The person at the counter says, \""$2.13\"". \n\nHey, I'm all for a great discount, but given that the frosty pushes two bucks alone, something was amiss.\n\nNo translator was available, but we managed to figure out she'd charged me for the 99 cent \""crispy chicken\"" sandwich, no fries and a small frosty.\n\nSo she re-rang it, correctly I assumed.\n\nI get my bag o' food, and she plops down not a frosty, but a soft drink. Whatever, I'm kinda in a hurry, so I just grabbed it and left. This is after all, \""fast food\"", I was freaking starving and just wanted to get out.\n\nIn the car I find I got not a chicken sandwich, but a hamburger. And not large fries, but a small order.\n\nThe burger was, Wendy's. The fries, Wendy's. The soda, diet (which I think tastes like feet).\n\nI've eaten a LOT of fast food in my time, but I don't recall ever having EVERYTHING wrong."
4,"I want to be perfectly honest here and say that the 5 star review is forthe past two seasons. Though I have been a fan since the team was in St. Louis (I lived in Chicago, my dad is a Bears fan) this year,or past few games desrves the rating.\n\nI think it is safe to say that the new stadium has helped this team. Though Denny Green didnt win with it, he is partially responsible for the talent that is here now. \n\nI have been following this fanchise for almost 24 years and can say that I agreed with the people of St. Louis years after the birds left, that Bidwell may have cheated them out of a Super Bowl. \n\nI will always be a fan because thats what fans do. But I want to relish this moment. How often have fans of this franchise been able to say we are on top? The offseason will also be promising as the Cards have the most money to spend of anyof the teams. If the the Bidwells aretrully committed to winning, the franchise looks to be in fairly good shape for a few years to come!\n\nGo Cards!"
2,This used to be the best pizza in the valley.  The last two times we went we were disappointed.  The first time the pepperoni had no flaver.  This last time the italian sausage had no flavor.  The basic pizza is still good.
0,"I used to like Rosati's Pizza, but tonight I ordered a pizza for delivery at my hotel, and they told me it would be WITHIN the hour.  1 hour and 40 minutes later the pizza arrived....cold.  What a waste of money!  The delivery man said he would have them take 10% off.....ooooh, really?  The pizza should have been free!  Sorry to say....this will be my last Rosati's pizza."
4,"I've lived in Tempe for over thirteen years and have been ordering pizzas from this location since moving to Tempe from Ahwatukee. I've never had a bad pizza from the Ahwatukee location (Lived there 6 months.) nor the Tempe location. On average we order Rosati's pizza from this location at least every 3 weeks or so. We save the coupons from the boxes so we've had a lot of pizzas for half off over the 13 years of being a customer of the Tempe location. Our favorite pizza has been the Gonzo (Pepperoni, spinach, green olives.), we are currently ordering double pepperoni, double spinach, onions and black olives. Same quality for over 13 years. And no I have not received any compensation for this review - just wanted to submit an honest review."
2,"An OK kinda joint. Was empty when i walked in. Humm... Not necessary a good sign. Alright, screw it i'll do it, its just hair, it'll grow back right? So, i hop in a chair right away and some dude starts hacking away, mostly using a buzzer. Bzzzrr, bzzzrrrr. 20 or so min later i am done. Military style, huh? Not exactly my cup o tea, but what could i expect when i asked for a short haircut?"
2,"Went here for lunch.  I had one of the specials of the day, the seafood cannelloni.  My husband had the baked ziti.  We started out our meals with a nice cheesy foccacia-like bread with olive oil + parmesan cheese dipping mixture.  Our entrees were quickly made and came minutes after being ordered, which was nice since we only had a limited amount of time for lunch.  The seafood cannelloni was just one large tube of pasta, filled with crab, scallops, and shrimp.  The sauce was decent, a creamy tomato mixture.  However, the pasta tasted rubbery, and the shrimp was overcooked and tough.  My husband's ziti was pretty good though.  It was a large amount of pasta, with a nicely browned mozzarella topping.  The sauce itself had a nice smokey flavor to it, and the pasta was perfectly al-dente.  Service was good.  Drinks were refilled promptly as needed.\n\nSo, a mixed experience here.  I'd definitely come here again for some fresh pasta dishes, but I'll pass on the cannelloni."
3,If you are looking for true Italian food in the Chandler/Tempe area this is the place.  Family Owned and operated by a true Italian New York Family!  You walk in and are pleasantly surprised by the beautiful decor and the mom and pop rapport.  The service was good and friendly.  We started with a Caesar salad that was extremely tasty.  My husband had the linguine with red clam sauce that was delicious (huge chunks of garlic and clams visible).  I had the baked ziti that was no joke about 2 lbs of food and excellent.  My picky little daughter loved it too!  We ended with the cannoli dessert that topped off the already yummy meal!  The prices are very reasonable especially for an Italian restaurant.  With the coupons and incredible take out discounts this is a total hit!!!
1,After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.
2,"boston's. dirty, dirty, dirty boston's. \n\nthe beer is flat, the decor is deteriorating before your eyes (literally saw a ceiling tile fall on someone.), and the offtrack betting is amazing and makes you feel even dirtier!\n\nbut this is a dive bar and you should have no standards when you walk in here. if you have standards all the time you should probably go hit up some glitzy, clean chain bar that serves those drinks with little umbrellas in them. this is dirty boston's.\n\nthey serve minipitchers during happy hour for around 3.50 depending on if you like domestic or you want to get fancy with an imported beer. service has always been friendly and actually pretty prompt. bathrooms are scary, but c'mon, didn't i tell you this was a dive bar? don't go looking for ambience, just come here if you'd like to get really drunk really fast. priorities."
0,"OK, so it is drab - that it is.  But I the wait staff on my visit was the dumbest most clueless idiot I have ever seen - no exaggeration.\n\nThe drink oder was taken 3 times and the waitress got it wrong three times (it was only a two drink order) after requesting 3 times as to what happened with our wings, we finally got chicken strips and fries - after 50 minutes.\n\nRun away -"
0,"I got food poisoning after eating at this location, I almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea. I will NEVER eat Arby's again"
2,"For the price, you definitely get what you pay for at Barro's.  The pizza isn't amazing, but it's filling and decent enough for a lunch-on-the-go.\n\nTheir lunch buffet special is really affordable, though, so they usually fill up fast around noon on weekdays.  If you go, expect to wait in a line for a few minutes."
1,what a messy place! If you want to look a good bargain you have to look carefully because everything is chaos! Even Big Lots has more order. Not worth my time.
0,"DO NOT GO HERE!  Watch out - they will ruin your clothes and then give you the biggest, most expert run around you can ever imagine if you try to get them to replace them.  The owner is a blatant lier and she will rip you off."
2,"My review is based on the service.  I have always received great service from this location and have nothing to complain about. However, Taco Bell's quality of food is another story. If you have the extra couple bucks, get a real taco or burrito from Chipotle or Los Taquitos nearby. However, if you like cheap and tasteless food then this place is perfect for you. I only gave them a better rating because they have fast and quick service. The food quality is out of their control but I wouldn't give a business five stars solely on service."
2,"We got the 14 minutes or it's free deal, and boy, do they make sure the food gets to you in under 14 minutes, even if it means the hamburger is bloody & the salad looks like it's been sitting in the back of the fridge for 2 weeks. They didn't charge us for our food, thank goodness, but I won't go back there to that location or ask for that deal again."
0,"Holy crap does this place not have ANY customer service in their DNA.\n\nAs the retail customer and the person that ultimately keeps them in business, you'd think they'd be a little warmer, more helpful and willing to work with you. They are not. In fact my wife and I found them snobby, condescending and not at all helpful.\n\nDuring the remodel process, we had to go to the slab yard a few times, each time felt like we were an inconvenience to them. \n\nThe final trip to Arizona Tile came a week before fabrication. Our fabricator Diamond Granite (see their AWESOME review on Yelp, went to confirm our slab was there. He asked them to pull it for us so that we could see it at 1:30PM as we had a very limited window of time to view the slab before picking up kids at school. When we arrived, they were once again too busy for us and had us take a seat. When we got to talk to someone they were unaware of our slab and asked who had our paperwork? How are we supposed to know? We were told they never pull a slab until a customer arrives and we'd have to wait for a large truckload that was now being offloaded. \n\nWe told them we had to be out at 2PM. It was now 1:45. At 2PM, we were told to be patient. At 2:15PM someone went out to see if the slab was there. It wasn't until 2:20PM a full 50 minutes after we arrived, that we had minutes to confirm our slab choice.\n\nI couldn't wait to get out of there. My wife and I hated the experience of working with Arizona Tile. The other company we looked at was Bedrosian's and the experience there was night and day different.\n\nOur recommendation: Go to Bedrosian's first for great customer service. If they don't have what you want, be prepared to get crappy customer service in exchange for the larger selection."
2,"The mainstay driving my 2-star rating is the fact that they had NO water in any of their vending machines or at the food counter. In Arizona, you must, must serve water. They had old brewed tea and Power aid drinks, but fundamentally, I can't believe they didn't have water.\n\nBatting Cages- Good\nGolf Driving Range- Good\nBumper Boats- Water was not clean and looked gross\nMini-golf- Okay\nGo Carts- Seats were really torn up and a lot of the cars didn't work\n\nThis place is operating on a thread. Minimal staff and they drained every fountain in the park to save on money. I can't totally blame them for that."
0,"This review is for the miniature golf only.\n\nIf you are in Tempe you don't have many options for miniature golf nearby. It's either Fiddlesticks or Golfland Sunsplash. If you are trying to figure out where to go, go to Golfland. They at least have interactive courses, some variation, and working \""streams\"" for about the same price. At Fiddlesticks the courses are very plain and repetitive. They might be good for practice but are not a lot of fun. Also Google maps may send you the wrong way finding Fiddlesticks. It's on Elliot in Tempe between Priest and Hardy not Chandler by Alma School."
0,"Worse place ever! Old bad equipment, no one working and they sell rides by time and no one working to assist....huge waste of money and when we complained they could not even locate a manager! WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!"
4,"I can't say enough nice things about Autoplex Autoservice. After figuring out that we may have bought a lemon from a used car dealer, we took our car here to get it checked out. Unfortunately our worst fears turned out to be true, but Lou and Mike have gone above and beyond with their service and advice, even though it turns out to be uneconomical to get repairs done. I will definitely be using them in the future when we get a new car. \nIf you want honest, friendly and excellent service, look no further."
1,"It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner."
0,"Disgusted by server who goes by the name of \""Mike\"" and how he served my children!!!!!!!!"
2,"Consistently mediocre food. One day you might get wings drowning in sauce, and the next day get scarcely any. Other than that, you pretty much know what to expect here. The food is just OK, the prices are just OK, service mostly just OK - unless you get Jared and then service is 5 star. My biggest gripes - it's always WAY too loud in the bar (loud music makes people have to shout across the table) and they charge 50c for blue cheese when they have a wing special. Really???"
0,"Service was excellent by Jessica & Emily in the bar! Very disappointed that they don't offer anything for our Veteran's, being that it is Memorial Day weekend.. Take care of our Veteran's and I'll give  but only one star for now!!!"
0,This place is nasty. A have friends who recently contracted food poison from their bone in wings. Someone in that kitchen isn't cooking food right. I'll never go back. Drive to a different location.
4,"I have been practicing yoga for years and have had the opportunity to be in class with some wonderful teachers in a few different cities. I am now \""full-time RV-ing\"" & many times have to practice yoga with a cd or iPhone ap or just put together a practice of my own.  I prefer this type of home practice over a studio or teacher that does not inspire me. But when I am lucky enough to happen on a beautiful space & inspiring teacher I really appreciate it. \n\nSuch a place is Gilbert Yoga! I practiced this morning with Heather who I believe was subbing for someone else & boy was I lucky!!  And because we will be in town for 6 more weeks I purchased a 10 class pass & look forward to returning. \n\nI have returned twice since the my draft above & had the opportunity to practice with Cassandra, who was also a wonderful teacher - thoughtful, peaceful & full of happiness.\n\nNamaste"
2,"The Pizza and Wings are good by the Buffalo native's sense of flavor and quality. The service is just \""OK\"" and nothing to write home about. The other menu items are a mixed bag depending on what you order. I've been here 4 times so it is good enough to keep me coming back, but definitely not as good as it could be with better placeware, real napkins, better service and maybe a more customer engaging attitude."
3,"Loved the stadium recliner seats - this is a super KID-friendly area and the theatre was packed with the wee ones. Good if you're in the parent zone, but if you're not...."
4,"Bryant Pest Control is the Best.  They are affordable, and truly take care of their customers.  when they arrive at our home they are always professional and very courteous.  We appreciate the Excellent customer service they supply and well as their flexibility when it comes to scheduling.\nthank you for the continued excellent service."
4,"We have been using Bryant Pest Control for a couple of years.  They are always on time, neat and professional. The phone person who calls the day before they spray is always in an upbeat mode and a pleasure to talk to.  Like most people, we are not fond of bugs.  Accordingly we have Bryant Pest Control out once a month, year round.  Never an issue and rarely do we see any bugs.  If you are not having them spray every 30 days, you might wish to consider that program.  To us it is money well spent."
2,"I love Petco, it's been my go-to place for all my pet's needs (and I have a few), and I've always found what I needed here at reasonable prices...until recently.\n\nThey have really started marking their prices up considerably and I'm not sure why. Not a dollar or two, but over four and five dollars on things that you can get at Target at the lower price. Bad news. (This applies to treats - not to specialty foods)\n\nThe good news is that this place has a good selection, they are never out of anything I need and the people are really great. It's a pleasant place to shop. \n\nJust please adjust your prices to match with the big box stores, overpricing things you can get elsewhere for cheaper just seems like a bad idea (and I will gladly make an extra stop to save $5).  Even the rewards program here doesn't help with that!"
4,"I had a great pedicure and it was only $20! My tech took a really long time making my nails look great, so I felt like I got my money's worth.  Only complaint is that they could use some new chairs."
0,"First and only time I'll ever go to this location. The guy at the window was straight up tweaking! I'm talking legit meth head, paranoid schizo status, scratching left and right and extremely jittery. I'm surprised he even managed to get my drinks out the window into my hand without spilling them! Yikes... \n\n\nSay no to meth and Burger King for that matter, kids."
1,"Not a huge fan of this place, although the barber did give me a proper fade. I would have to say its over priced for mens cuts and way to long of a wait.... its not a super cuts and its not a high class salon either so in my eyes it is very useless"
2,"Got my hair cut,  styled &  colored.  Was ok but wasn't wowed or anything.  Stylist didn't seem like she wanted to color my hair how I wanted it so had to do it something else.  Came out ok but not totally I  love with it..... Then she had to dye my hair twice because first time it didn't come out right.  Service is great just didn't love my hair how it came out &  definitely over priced."
0,"Tired of going through the drive thru, ordering what I do and getting something totally different by the time I get home. Has happened more then three times in the last 6 months. I don't get as to how hard it is to get an order right.  I have spoken to the manager and called and they just don't seem to care. They fill like you are trying to get a free meal out of them. And you know what? They should give me a free meal for always screwing up my order.. Frustrated! YES I AM darn it."
0,"I've been frequenting this pharmacy for at least 3 years, and I find this review is long overdue.  I'd like the start by saying the pharmacists here are skilled and knowledgeable, even if they never remember who I am.  The techs they have working here are another story, Not only are they not skilled, and not knowledgeable, they very obviously lack general customer service skills.  \n\nI have two of my scripts set up on auto fill, every 90 days.  For those of you not familiar with the auto fill concept, it's supposed to take the hassle out of refilling your drugs, with the pharmacy taking care of contacting your Dr and filling it on time.  In the last 12 months, my auto fill has been messed up 3x, considering it only fills 4x a year, that's not really impressive.  Each time it's been a different excuse, and each time I end up making multiple phone calls and trips to the pharmacy to get it straightened out.  This last time, it took me 3 phone calls and 3 trips.  \n\nThe techs with whom I spoke to on the phone were rude and argumentative.  After I gave up on calling and went in person, with a reasonable solution, Ada (the tech attempting to assist me) spent a solid 15 minutes arguing with me, insisting what I was asking for could not be done.  Since this wasn't my first rodeo with Cvs, (I had them perform this request before), I knew I was being bs'd.  While a line of angry people formed behind me, she got flustered and took a phone call.  Apparently she decided she was no longer going to help me.  One of the pharmacists stepped up to help the next person in line, and she told him to help me instead.  I explained my plight to him, and he resolved it in less than 2 minutes.  \n\nThe moral of this story is if the techs don't know how to do, they will tell you it can't be done.  They have no interest in actually helping you, and are not concerned with the lack of customer service they provide.  On my last call, I informed the tech that I found her inability to provide a solution unacceptable, and her response was I can't change it....no admission of guilt, not even an apology, just pure attitude and contempt.  So go ahead, mess up my prescription, catch an attitude with me and refuse to fix it.  I'm sure that will work out for you in the long run."
3,They got great service but they have slow wifi download rate......down is 1.10 mps and up is 0.60 mps .... That sucks... Lol
4,At nails of the world they actually care about u as a person. They do great work & my polish never peals. They are Always friendly. I've been going there for a couple years now & I would recommend nails of the world to anyone of my friends & family.
2,"It's a Target. You know the drill. Clean, well stocked, good prices. I'm a regular."
0,"So..I hardly ever write reviews for places (as you can see) and I just felt compelled to after I picked up another round of dry cleaning that was less than great to say the least. I have tried out Meridian a few times since I ive in the area. Like other Yelpers have said...great for men's shirts. My husband's shirts come out fine. Thats because they require no work. I could do it, but why? So now on to my laundry...they can not seem to iron or press my shorts on the crease for the life of them and have now managed to just make my shorts look like crap. On to the button up I took there the other day (I dont really know how this is that different from a mens shirt except it was short sleeve) well where my sleeves roll up it was not pressed and was not rolled up properly....like the person that was taking care of my shirt really had no idea what they were doing. I did just as good of a job in my bathroom the next morning with my flat iron on my shirt. On a seperate previous trip I took in a dress that said \""dry clean only\"" after examining it for what felt like ever (it was not super nice just had some silver designs) they asked if I had it dry cleaned before and I said no, but the tag said \""DRY CLEAN ONLY\"" they then refused to dry clean it because the silver \""would come off\"" - Something I highly doubt as I have put it in the washer since and it has been fine.  These are just a few examples of the crappy results I have had from this place....so needless to say, even though yes, they are close and yes, they are cheap I will NOT be going back. I will be going to the more expensive, further away dry cleaner that seems to know how to do their job properly."
1,"Been going there for years.  Sadly, after the manager left, this place has gone down hill very rapidly.  It is too bad cause this drycleaner use to operate pretty smoothly.  I can't possibly recommend them to anyone if they can't keep good help around there. So long..."
3,"went here for lunch with my boyfriend. we came on a friday so they had specials going on. its a really big place. they have peanuts on the table which is awesome and bad cause they are addicting! lol. we both got beer. i ordered a blue moon and like it should, came with and orange slice! my boyfriend got a hamburger and i got tacos. they were really good! i would definitely go back to this place!"
1,"This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here."
3,"My hubby and I took the kids there and sat outside during happy hour. The service was great, they had decent HH specials on both drinks and food. The kids had fun with the peanuts. We were the only ones outside and our server did a great job of remembering we were out there. I think it would have been pretty pricey to have a full dinner there, but the HH specials made it affordable with 3 kids."
3,All PPP have the same layout.  This one I have to say is cleaner than the others.  Kids are everywhere!!!  The pizza was not bad.  The wings are not too bad either.  They did an excellent job on my friend kid's birthday.  The person dedicated to the party she got every detail down and timed it just right.  Everyone had a great time.
4,"Always a great place to bring our little one (4 years old) Games are Fun, pizza is always great. Prices haven't changed much over the years. Highly recommend for anytime of day and any occasion."
4,"We love Dr. Quackenbush and all the staff at Timber Falls!  I have four kids going there ranging from age 3 to 11 and each one of them enjoy going.  Dr. Quackenbush is very professional, caring, and honest and when there are issues with my kids' teeth he always goes through each option available and lets me know which one is the best for that child and the situation (not the one that would pay him more money).  One of my younger daughters has had to have several baby root canals done there and still never hesitates to go back because they always take such good care of her there and never make her feel uncomfortable.  I highly recommend Dr. Quackenbush!"
1,"Target has a promotion they call Holly Jolly Savings.  It is promoted as spend $50 on Holiday items and get $10 off at the register. Sounds easy enough!  I fill my shopping cart with holiday Items and get to the check out..  My total was $171.80.  I showed the cashier my coupon, she scanned it  and told me my purchases did not qualify.  Really?,.....I ask how much more do I need to spend to qualify?  She does not have a clue but suggested I inquire at the customer service desk.  I go to the customer service desk and the clerk also has no clue to how the promotion works, but he was somehow sure I did not qualify.  I told him I would no longer be shopping at Target and he smiled and wished me a good day.  Officially added Target to my do not shop there anymore list along with Sears and Kmart..  I added a star as they have incredible shopping carts."
2,"Since we're going to be moving right near this place, we checked it out.  It's not like our favorite hangout Dizzy's, but it definitely has a cool vibe.  A bunch of us checked it out on Friday night and the people watching alone is worth it.  \n\nForgot the bartender's name, but she was awesome and took care of us never leaving us dry.  \n\nIt's a small bar on the outside, but great music and a few pool tables on the inside.  Check it out if you get a chance!"
3,"Thai tea and a doughnut.  Aside from not being what the diet doctor ordered , the sweet on sweet may not have been the best combination idea I've ever had, but separately, both were good!\n\nPop was out but definitely a mom'n'pop kind of place.  Nice down-homey little doughnut & sandwich & coffee shop.  Very nice lady behind the counter, her young son hanging out unobtrusively nearby.  Worth a stop if you get a hankering for sweet fried delight while you're in the hood on south side of Olive at 47th Ave."
0,"I made an appointment at this location 2 weeks ago. When I show up at the agreed upon time I am informed there isnt an appointment under my name. Instead of apologizing for their error, the representative immediatley states I must have called the  wrong location and proceeds to call a nearby store. Of course, they didnt have anything under my name either, but that is because I didnt schedule the appointment there. You would think at this point an apology would be appropriate but no, I am told they are booked solid and the vehicle might get squeezed in if left all day. After further review a sliver of time is found for 3 hours later. Guess who is the only one inconvenienced, the one that made the good for nothing appointment to begin with. As we all know the key to taking a reservation is holding it, anyone can TAKE a reservation."
4,"Fucking BENTO BOX!!!!  Oh man,  getting diabetes has never been so delicious.  These boxes are massive to the point where you can barely close the thing.  It's as if the food is fighting imprisonment so it can raid your taste buds for all they're worth.  These babies have dumplings, rice, fried pork, teriyaki chicken, and a small salad so you don't feel so bad about it afterwards.   Which you won't. \nNow if you don't want to look like a total slob you can get the Teryiaki Chicken bowl.  (Spicy is my thing but hey, you can puss out if you want)\nOne massive bowl of rice and meat later and nothing seems so bad anymore.  Not even the dead hooker in your trunk can steal anything from this afterglow."
2,"My family and I are such BIG fans of the Jalapeno Dynamites, sometimes it's hot and sometimes very hot.  We don't care we love it!  I would like to see at least one steam side in the future, but I suppose fried sides are more popular here.  The food is delish...it wouldn't hurt if they change up using different vegetable(s) sometimes instead of the ever popular onions and cabbage in some of the chicken dishes.  The teriyaki chicken and broccoli could be substituted with a different vegetable for those who are allergic to broccoli.  I love the vegetable bowl minus the broccoli.  I love some of the sushi rolls esp. the specialty ones, BIG portion sizes.  Miso soup is so good too.  The owner-manager is the only one who makes the best sushi so I understand he can't be there 7 days/wk.  It wouldn't hurt to call beforehand if he's there or not if you're craving for sushi."
0,"A friend of mine was just talked into joining this gym last week. 18 year old who hadn't experienced the classic \""gym\"" sales crap.\nAFTER they accpeted his membership fee and first and last.. THIS GYM IS SHUTTING DOWN in TWO WEEKS!! What a joke! \n\nSo everyone was correct in their previous posts that this place should shut down but they shouldn't have accepted any memberships knowing they were closing in two weeks."
1,"Do you want to die shortly after being slapped in the face with a cover charge that shouldn't be charged and then having your girlfriend gang raped on the dance floor?\n\nIt receives two stars simply because I used to like the place.  Pool, good music, dancing, reasonable drink prices.  But, after a couple of tense situations, witnessing fights on a near weekly basis, and a parking lot shooting....I'll pass these days.\n\nI don't do karaoke so that side of the establishment might be okay."
2,"Spit your gum out before you enter. Be prepared to get frisked. Bring .50$ for the locker. And forgo all fear and enjoy yourself. \n\nYes, it's swarming with young 'uns on Saturday night, but don't let them whizzing by you, showing you up, discourage you from letting your inner child come out to play. In fact, laugh much, laugh hard and don't be afraid of falling. \n\nI fell once, taking my date down with me. Ha! It was the highlight of my skating experience. So funny. \n\nI wasn't sure what to expect, but Great Skate is alot of fun. If you aren't pro enough to skate backwards or play the games, just watch. It's fun, too. \n\nI recommend this place and roller skating for when you need to break away from reality and just enjoy yourself. \n\nI give this place only 3 stars because it's not in the greatest neighborhood (hence security measures) and you have to be ready for a bunch of kids running around and, well, being kids. If you can handle either, then you're golden."
1,"Dr. Bischoff is wonderful ONLY IF:\nA) You are rich and/or have the Cadillac of insurance plans.\nB) Have no health issues\nOtherwise, don't waste you're time and money (even with the voucher).\nI purchased the voucher ($99 of service for $50). I sent my husband there for a cleaning and he needed 2 small gumline fillings. We were visiting AZ from MA for 6 months only. Dr. Bischoff scared the Heck out of him by insisting on testing him for mouth cancer due to his oral exam of his mouth (test = negative thank God) . Then, he tells him he has gingivitis which will require deep oral scalings (four) at a cost of over a thousand dollars. When my husband explained that we were only here while I was at the Cancer Institute for treatment and that he only wanted a basic cleaning and to get the two small cavities filled (they were hurting him when he ate) and that we couldn't afford the suggested treatment,  Dr. Bischoff flatly refused to do anything until the deep scaling - which would take 3-4 months to perform - was completed.\nSooo...I guess Dr. Bischoff only cares about you if you are rich enough to afford whatever treatment he deigns  to do regardless of what you really need and can afford done. My poor husband was sent away, still in pain and now feeling horrible because we don't have the money or time to have this large procedure done...all because he is my primary and only care giver and terrible me had to get Cancer and spend most of our money coming to the Cancer Institute of America in order to try and save my life. Sounds a bit chilly for such a \""caring individual\"".....although they did send a \""happy birthday\"" email to him on his birthday (yeah, not much to celebrate with aching teeth and a dying wife). Nice marketing strategy...\nOh, and by the way, we have an excellent dentist back home in Boston, MA whom we regularly see and have been with for over 20 years...He has all the best /latest and greatest equipment too! Upon arriving home, my husband went to him and he doesn't have gingivitis and was right to refuse the deep scaling as due to his health conditions, which include a heart murmur and high blood pressure, the regular dentist has never done a deep scaling. All knowledgeable dentists should require a medical clearance from a PCP prior to performing deep scalings as people with these conditions can have strokes or heart attacks from the debris dislodged during the procedure which travels into the blood stream. My husband's PCP will not give the clearance.\nTypical example of all gloss and glamor but no substance. Real nice digs and alot of expensive toys for the doc to play with but so much for sincere compassionate care!"
2,"Happy hour prices pretty good. Spinach artichoke dip and tortilla chips kind of salty. Our server was Olivia who made a pretty good Long Island iced tea but wasn't as attentive as Racquel was the last time we were in. Still overall we love the food here, usually good."
4,"They have the best pizza, we drive 50 miles to get this pizza. There wings are also great and you can't beat there beef on kummelweck it is so good. We have also had there subs and pasta dishes and all is great. So don't hesitate about going to eat here it is so worth it."
1,"Sunday morning before 11am we were there and it was packed to the gills at this IHOP. OMG, the waiting area inside was full, the wait area in between the inside and outside doors were full and the entrance has about 4 people stand around. WOW! We waited about 20 mins for 5 of us. \n\nThe menus were sticky and mine had a smashed paper liner of a straw in it. The table looked clean and the seats were redone. The place got HOT, there was a lot of people. \n\nI got the ham and cheese omelet. It was a little dry. The french toast was pretty good. \n\nAll in all, meh...."
0,"Went to eat some pancakes this morning and of course being a Sunday it was very busy. We had to sit outside because they had called our name and we didn't show so longer wait. We sit outside, order drinks and food but it took about 30 minutes to get our food. Our food finally arrives but they forget my husbands food. We thought maybe they're still making it but they forgot because we asked what was taking so long and turns out his food was just sitting there. Very frustrating. Didn't bring us syrup or ranch for my food until very late. Our waiter was very bad charged us wrong and wouldn't let us settle the ticket up at the front desk. Never going there again honestly I'll just stick to Denny's."
4,I was greeted right away by a very friendly staff.  Even those I was late I got started right away. I appreciated the little extra time Tina and Hyeu took to make sure my nails were meticulous! They run a clean shop and do an excellent job! Thank you Kathy for the humorous chit chat on the side.  I am coming back for certain
4,"Keep in mind - ***** - \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"" - IN ARIZONA\n\nBeing that my Thai grandmother's blood runs through my veins, and it's all I had growing up at home, I'd like to say that I'm a pretty credible Thai food yelper.  For the past MANY years, this is the only Thai restaurant that my parents will dine in. \n\nTheir menu is pretty eclectic since they offer everything from stir-fried noodles, noodle soups, stir-fried meat/veggie dishes, and fried rice. I had the pad Thai the last time I went to pick up take-out about 3 weeks ago. It was WAY spicy, but I asked for it. Despite the streams of sweat that were rolling down my temples, the noodles were delicious! My other favorite dish here is the pad kee mao which translates into stir fried drunkard. This dish is best spicy as well. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and love authentic Thai food."
0,Do not come here! This place is packed full of people waiting to have an abortion and it's really gross. They don't take time to explain anything and they will not even let your boyfriend or husband in the ultrasound room if you want him there. You can definitely find help somewhere else where you are not treated like cattle!
4,"Now, I am very hesitant to give a dentist 5 stars.  I mean if I was rating dentists as a whole, I would give them negative stars.  I have gone to a *lot* of dentists in my day and would never have considered giving one above 3 stars.  Then, I met Dr. Wyatt.  \n\nFirst, his helpers are super helpful and friendly.  They are nice and sometimes when they ask a question, they actually take the tools out of your mouth for you to answer!\n\nSecond, Dr. Wyatt himself follows suit and is nice.  Even when you have issues he's nice about it.  He doesn't lecture or raise his voice or even seem angry that you don't do something, like oh floss all the time...  He truly seems like he wants you to have a happy, healthy smile, not like he is frustrated with your behavior.\n\nLastly, his office is called \""Reel Dental\"" and they have a movie theme.  Though somewhat cheesy, it's nice to have movies on in the waiting room and such.  Rumor has it that when you go in for long dental work, which I never have, you can watch a movie while it's done!  Anything to take your mind of the fact you're in a dentist chair is great.\n\nOh, and for the ladies, he's quite easy on the eyes to look at while being worked on!"
3,This place has really good halal kohbedays.  However they close pretty early and are not even open on Sunday's . There hours are M-S 11-9.
3,"Every once and a while I need a little Grand Dragon in my life!\n\nI stumbled upon this place when I was working on a house in Glendale and needed to fulfill my need for some Chinese food - and then I was hooked. For under $10 I can get general's chicken with brown rice, crab puffs, spring roll, and lo mein. Oh and you want to add a side of sweet and sour chicken to that order for $2.95 - perfect!\nThis food is delicious and affordable. Trust me you will get filled up and have some to take home for lunch the next day! The service is always great and the restaurant itself is comfortable!\n\nAnd I'll have to cut this review short to stuff some more general's chicken in my face!\n\nCheers!"
1,"Thought we'd try to stay closer to home and saw the reviews for this place, not so bad. Was greeted by a super friendly guy who quickly changed from friendly to downright annoying. He took our drink orders as soon as he seated us, was back in a flash and asked if we needed more time. Yes, we did. Two minutes later, asked if we were ready. Nope, sorry. Again. And again. I don't know what his hurry was but he was determined to get our order within 5 minutes of us walking in the door. Whatever. \n\nI ordered the house chicken. When it arrived I was surprised, they give you a lot of food! I thought I had hit the jackpot! It was crispy, not overly sweet or spicey. Very good. We had a lot of leftovers, everything turned out great.\n\nUntil about 5 hours later. I was pretty gassy after that but whatevs, I don't mind farting and I'm pretty gassy anyways. Then it became painful. I knew it was coming and it was going to be hot. I got the shits. Explosive. Seven times. \n\nIt's hard to tell what exactly has turned your ass into a chocolate fountain by the end of the day...but I won't risk it again."
4,"What can I say.... This is hands down one of the best places to eat!  Visit probably once a week and always request the same waiter.  Service is great, food is excellent, prices are perfect!"
4,"We are here all the time.  We sometimes blow in late and announce to our waiter that we are really pushed for time.  They just smile and accommodate us.  Our food comes out piping hot, perfect and within an amazingly short time.  Their cheese crisp is the best in town, as is their tortilla soup.  My husband's favorite is the \""E\"" (he says, \""E for Excellence.\"")  It's a chicken chimi, basically.  They also make a really nice chicken taquito, ... you get four presented in a mini flour taco shell on a bed of lettuce.  Yum!  The service is friendly and I would suggest this restaurant to anyone who loves good Mex Tex."
0,"RUN!!!  This place was not a good experience.   We rented a car from the PHX airport and went to this location to trade it in since the original car was shaking at high speed on the highway.  The Ford Escape they offered us a the location is an embarrassment to the the whole company....it was filthy dirty, smelled like smoke and vomit and was an older model with high mileage.... I thought it was a joke at first........ they also had a bad attitude that we didn't want it........ughhh...we finally got a Chevy Impala, but the building was filthy and this place needs to be torn down ....."
2,"Friends called me yesterday afternoon and asked me to stop and have a beer with them and watch the ALCS game.  Sort of a cool neighborhood bar with a small bar food menu.  Most of the patrons seemed to know each other or were in small groups at a single table like we were.  I counted 7 screens but I forgot to see if there were any over by the pool tables.  4 pool tables, 7 dart boards, shuffleboard and a couple of video games.  The tables and stools are all anchored.  The door has been replaced with a privacy wall in the men's room and the one stall looks like the door has been removed and replaced a few times.  The padded rails on the tables need reupholstering.  Overall the place seems in pretty good shape.  They have a fenced in smoking patio but I didn't see any chairs or tables on it.\n\nI had a toasted ham and cheese on sourdough ($5.75)and I chose to have it with onion rings, although I could have chosen fries or cottage cheese.  It was good and I thought a pretty good deal.  I had MGD long necks at $3 each.  Not sure if that was happy hour or regular price, I didn't ask.  \n\nAll the employees I dealt with were pleasant and efficient.  I Left by 7 so I don't know if the vibe changes as the evening goes on.  I noticed several folks just like me that joined friends and left after a drink or two.  I had a good time with friends and wouldn't hesitate to go back again.\n\nThe woman opening up early Saturday sure looked at me funny taking pictures of the place as she walked up to the door. :-)"
2,"That place is very, very dark but the beer mugs are big and cold! lol. The service was good and their BLT was yummy, plus they give you a BIG portion of fries. I was bummed that I was there during the wings and onion rings but didn't get any. Boo!! Maybe next time :)"
0,Wish I could give them zero stars. The other reviews are spot on. They don't want your business. They refuse to honor Subway coupons. The employees act rude and condescending. Their prices are more expensive than other Subways in the area. I'd recommend the Subway at 51st and Olive if you're looking to eat at Subway in this neighborhood. Avoid this one at all costs!
3,Their green chile burritos are great! Enough for my husband and I to share too. Really love the chips and salsa! Better than many other places!
4,"I think Korina might have mixed this place up with somewhere else - or perhaps has an ex-boyfriend working there... \n\nCommunity Tire is one of the most professional companies I have ever done business with, and they definitely stand behind their work 100%.\n\nI have used two of the Community Tire locations and had nothing but perfect results. Fast, fair, friendly! Plus, they give back a lot to the local community."
4,"I still love this campus BUT I do agree with the angry person that if you want the quintessential party college experience, this campus (and Poly) are not for you.\n\nThis is like a liberal arts college in that most of the classes are less than 30 people, some have up to 100 but it's not large lecture style like Tempe and other universities.\n\nIf you don't care about partying and you live in NW Phoenix then this school is AWESOME!"
0,"I do not give 1 star reviews lightly, but this business is beyond unprofessional.  Their business practices seem to change with the mood of the owner, and it is the customers who suffer."
3,"5 corn dogs for 5 bucks.......Tuesday special on Milkshakes for 1.29......Franks made with Chicken instead of Beef or Pork.....Priceless. This establishment is great place to stop after going to an NFL.....NHL...MLB....or Spring Training game because it is near all of those facilities if your head back to the East Side of the Valley. The restaurant is very clean....the staff is nice and the food is very good. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
3,"I love this location because it's right on my way to work... I had a breakfast sandwich here once that I wasn't too fond of  so now I just get the regular bagels - the spinach florentine is my fave. \n\nThe lines can get kind of long here in the morning, but the staff so far has done a good job not making everyone wait too long. Nothing worse than having employees who don't give a rat's ass, so I'm glad it's not the case here. In fact, everyone has been really nice here always saying good morning and smiling...at least every time I've been here."
0,"Terrible pharmacy! Can't say how many times they have messed up my prescriptions. And even when it's been their fault their answer is \""once it leaves the pharmacy nothing can be done\"" if they just had an ounce of customer service instead of just being flat out rude I wouldn't mind so much. From here on out ill drive the extra 15min to another just so I don't have to deal with them again."
2,Mom came in by ambulance on Friday with a fractured femer on the left leg where her prior hip repleacement from 2005 had taken the hit from her fall. The old hip was removed and a new hip with a longer leg shaft was inserted. She has been out of it for several days but Wednesday she finally walked and Thursday she was more herself again. The food has been good for hospital food and the nurses have been wonderful. No one enjoys waiting around the ER or waiting for tests and all of the other things that happen in a hospital. But this is a very nice facility and staff. And believe me with Dad having a stroke and various surgeries and Mom being the $6million woman with this her 6th major surgery I have experienced lots of hospitals!
4,"I didn't expect to have to visit Banner Thunderbird again so soon after the birth of my son on 7/16 but an emergency arose that caused us to have to return with him. The pediatric ER was FANTASTIC. They made us feel at ease, were prompt with their care of our baby, and provided answers quickly with what our next steps were. \n\nUltimately, we had to stay overnight and stayed in the pediatric unit with our baby so here is part 2 of our visit....\n\nThe Peds unit is OUTSTANDING. Our nurses, Robyn and Jamie, were kind, understanding, and very professional. We were treated like friends rather than just patients. Our pediatricians during our stay was professional, nurturing, and didn't allow us to beat ourselves up over our baby's issue. But the best part of our visit was our tech, Mary. She treated our baby like he was one of her own kids and she treated us like royalty while we were there. \n\nThough I'm not looking forward to having to go back to the hospital, I know that when I do have to go back, I will receive excellent, high quality, nurturing care from Banner Thunderbird Medical Center."
2,"Unfortunately, my father has had a few emergencies relating to his heart/lungs. Most recently, he stayed at this hospital. I absolutely loved the nurse (forget her name). She was very attentive and caring, even though she obviously had to care for many other patients.\n\nI was disappointed in the doctors, however. My father's ailment was in relation to his diet. In addition, my father has diabetes. In this kind of situation, I would think a nutritionist or dietician would be sent to speak with the patient about what kinds of things would be best for them to eat, especially since poor nutrition choices are a big part of the issue.\n\nOverall, this is a nice, clean hospital with a *mostly* diligent staff who care about the patients."
0,Having car problems is already bad enough. Labor was expensive but expected for a franchise. Customer service on the other hand was awful.
2,I have gotten take-out from here about once a month for the past three years. I normally get the chk broccoli and my husband gets the kung pow chk or the happy family delight. It is not the greatest Chinese food in the world but I like it and they give you a good portion size for the price. Try it out... if you don't like it you only wasted about $7.
0,"I've come here twice. Both times the vet tried to up-sell lots of tests and prescription pills. \n\nThe first time I thought they really were recommending what is for the best- and I actually did get the Xrays that they advised, though I had them done at a different vet's office, because it was significantly less expensive. (Those xrays didn't explain any of the problems either). The 2nd time, when I brought a stray dog in that looked significantly underweight. The vet said  she could feel the dogs liver... and as she began to explain the next part she hid her hands in her pockets, a classic move made by a person when not being forthcoming, and said it could be a mass, but it could also be because the dog is skinny. She said the dog looked pretty good other than that and she'd write up a action plan for getting the dog back in good health. She then left and sent in a tech with a itemized bill for blood work and shots over $500 worth. \n\nI then attempted to clarify what I came in for. I wanted to know the dogs health, if the dog appeared neglected or sick and what to do to help the dog gain the weight back. I wanted to know roughly how old the dog was, and what I could do to help the dog get healthy. I've never owned a dog before. I also said, I noticed the dog seemed stiff and I could hear her joints pop when she moved sometimes, and I would like information that could answer questions like, Should I give the dog glucocamine?\"". Is it an injury or just because of the age? The tech left to speak with the vet again, and then returned and said, the vet says the dog is about 5, though we can't really confirm that. Here is the Prescription she wrote up. \n\nAt this point, I was very aggravated. I exclaimed that I wanted information, dietary advice. My main concern was that the dog was underweight due to lack of food. I want to know things like what type of food is best to help the dog recover. I've NEVER even had a dog before, which I said when I made the appointment and stated several times throughout the appointment. The tech looked baffled, and I told her that I was not going to return to this clinic ever again. I went to pay and I told them that I felt swindled. I explained that I still didn't even have answers for simple questions on what type of food is best to feed an underweight dog, and I didn't understand why their office couldn't give basic care advice and instead just kept writing up quotes for tests and drugs. \n\nAt that point the tech came to the front and said she talked to the vet and the vet wanted me to have a handout about arthritis. I admit, I sarcastically thanked her for giving me information that I could have easily looked up myself online, and explained that now I still need to look up dietary information online and I think it's ridiculous that I should have to do that when I just paid $50 to talk to a veterinarian and have the dog examined. \n \nI left promising to contact the Better Business Bureau. Which I probably will do. \n\nI'm just at a point in my life where I'm sick of not getting what I pay for. Is anyone with me on this? It's like I can even by an f%#^$^% sweater that won't unravel in a month because everything is made in China by 5 year olds, I buy used cars around 60,000 miles, because new cars are put together so shoddy that used cars with that kind of mileage already have new transmissions and alternators and starters... The repairs are better quality than what you actually get when you buy the car, unless you get a mechanic that insists that you have replace a $500 part in order to fix a $200 part, when 3 other people gave you quotes that didn't include that repair- or an electrician that insists the lighting in your business needs to be replaced or the lights aren't going to turn on, but when they find out that there isn't anyway to authorize that type of repair a miracle from heaven unfolds and the lights magically work once again. \n\nHere's the truth people. Everyone's out to get your hard earned money, and few ever offer quality service or merchandise in return. \n\nThis veterinarian could have given me some advice like, since she's under weight you might want to feed her a puppy kibble or some wet food, or increase the portion- and also it wouldn't be a bad idea to do some blood work to see her overall general health. I could respect that, but not offering any advice on the animal whatsoever except for the tests and drugs, seems a bit ridiculous. And if they can't tell me anything about the health of the animal without the tests, then someone explain to me WHY ON EARTH THEY ARE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS? If you are that clueless as to the health of the animal without your $500 full work up, then how can you in confidence recommend $50 worth of prescription drugs? \n\nThe only redeeming quality that I have to mention about this place, is the techs are nice and friendly."
1,"Not bad, a little oily. Not sure that I like it. Might have to try it again."
1,"Started getting pizza here after moving to the area and sometimes it was good, other times, I felt that the pizza had way too much cheese and was too salty. Recently, we ordered more items including, pizza, chicken parm sandwich, cold roast beef sandwich, and mozz sticks. The pizza was cold, not cooked enough, very heavy, too much cheese. The chicken parm barely had any chicken on it, chicken tasted frozen, def not fresh, bread was so soggy, too much sauce. The sauce is horrible. It didn't taste fresh at all, was very dark red, salty, either cooked way too long, or had too many spices in it. The roast beef sub was gross, roast beef was gray and rubbery, not good quality meat, asked for extra oil and vinegar, and sandwich was drenched in olive oil. The mozz sticks were not fresh at all and as hard as a rock. Will NEVER give them my business again. Total waste of money and nothing at all like NY style pizza or food. (59th Ave location)"
4,"This has got to be the cleanest, nices, only non-smelling pet supply food store I have ever been to.  We came here today because they had a special event for kids like, petting zoo, fire truck, corn tub for kids to play in, Easter magnet making, & master gardeners to answer questions.  We hung out for about and hour and bought some feed for our chickens at home that we also bought at The Stock Shop.  I highly recommend this spot even if you have to drive a little....remember, pets mart stinks."
0,"I called this business to get an estimate for tile roof repair and no one ever called me back.  Bad business ethic.  They have an answering service, so there is no excuse.  Probably if I would have said that I needed a NEW roof, I would have received a call.  I even gave them the name of the person who referred them to me."
0,"I was jogging in the area and noticed signs, so I went to check it out. The place seems nice enough, but I got the impression the manger Ed and his son seem to run the place and would rather sit all day and collect their pay checks. I would love to know how much money they make sitting around all day hoping no one comes in and bothers them. I think I'll contact the city to see what is up."
2,"I keep getting behind on my Yelp reviews and blogging so I have been toying with the idea of having a computer at home for quite some time.  Recently I have been looking at the Best Buy ads and this weekend I finally decided to pull the trigger.  I almost got there on Saturday but ran out of time and found on Sunday the same laptop I intended to get was on a 2 day sale that included a free 3 in 1 printer.  Best Buy has in the past not always honored an internet sale price at their stores.  I could have ordered it online for in store pick up but I wanted to pay cash and I haven't figured out how to do that over the internet.  So I called the toll free number and the woman I talked with didn't know if I could reserve one on line or not so she gave me the store phone number.  Talked with Terence and he started by saying my sku was too long but he typed it in anyway and found it should ring up properly.  He then spent about 10 minutes finding the computer and printer and leaving them for me at customer service.  When I arrived I picked up some other items to go with them and a sales rep answered several of my questions and then I picked up my computer at customer service and payed for all it it right there so I didn't have to go through checkout also.\n\nActually a rather pleasant experience.  Over the years I have been in several Best Buys, this one the most.  Sometimes the service is lacking and sometimes like this time it is great.  They did try to up sell me on a few things but not nearly with as much pressure as they used to.  As the sales guy on the floor went over what this computer does compared to my office computers that are 7 or 8 years old he explained about writable DVDs but forgot to suggest I get some and I didn't catch it either so I will pick some up some where."
0,"Horrible customer service.  Seeing as how many of the floor employees are college-aged or somewhere thereabouts, their social skills are about as sharp as a high school student listening to an iPod at full volume while looking at the ground.  There are obviously employees who know all the right techno-jargon (I could hear them talking amongst each other), but not once did ANY employee offer to help me.  They all just seemed to be paired off in conversation with other floor workers without a care in the world, and far be it from me to interrupt them.  There was a general atmosphere of \""don't bother us, we can tell you're not a techie.\""   I was prepared to spend a fair amount of money on a new computer, and associated software, but due to the fact that they did nothing to help me, I took my business elsewhere.   Of course there are plenty of stores that have employees asking if you need help every two seconds, which can be annoying, but at least you feel valued as a potential customer.  At Best Buy Arrowhead, they can really take or leave you it seems.  I am a college kid myself, and I needed this equipment for school.  I was frankly angered by their obvious ignoring of myself and my brother. \n\nThe one redeeming thing:  although I was bothered, and subsequently left the store, the woman at the door said \""have a nice day.\""  At least one person gives a damn."
0,"I knew beforehand that going to best buy wouldn't be a good time, but I needed a charger for an electronic device ASAP. I brought the device with me and after trying for about 10 minutes, I was able to hunt someone down to help me. He took me to the section, opened the box and took out the charger and attached to my device. It was a little loose but he said I could just return it if it didn't work. \nNow it is certainly my fault for not knowing their return policy when purchasing, but it's 15 days. I came in three days late to return it (it didn't work) and they refused to return it. She said they could have still returned it, but in had been opened (I purchased it already opened from the store!!) I get that the return policy is 15 days, but come on. Any other store would have still done the return for a customer and at least offered store credit. I'm surprised they haven't gone out of business yet."
0,"Horrible service. Nobody to even help find out if they have more product in the back. I was in there for half an hour before I had to ask if anyone was available to help or if they're all just taking a break. Most employees just sulk around sittin at their posts, not even willing to walk around and put in work. And when they finally did make it around to asking me, the product I was looking for was out of stock. \nTwo things you need to work on. Keeping product in stock and having available associates rather than mindless desk zombies."
1,"This review is for people who have never worn a wig but want to 'try it'. My natural hair is highlighted blond and I wear it fairly short. They didn't have much of a selection for that in stock on the day I went in so I allowed the sales person/manager to convince me a highlighted reddish auburn wig was perfect for me. Two other customers in the store agreed so I was swayed and spent $140. I think I probably did look good in it - if you didn't know me. The change was just too drastic and I could tell by the looks I got from social acquaintances that it wasn't \""me\"" (my husband and favorite waiter at Abuelo's agreed). Everything about the color screamed I was wearing a wig. I know wigs are not returnable but I did want to call the manager and just suggest to her that when dealing with new wig wearers that she doesn't try to convince then that a totally different look works. It doesn't. Now if you are known for the variety of wigs you wear, it's a different story. She was defensive, of course. I certainly wasn't trying to get my money back - just letting her know my experience and I would not be wearing the wig."
1,"Had enough beer to think this was one of those hip, retro bars.\n\nPlatinum blonde indie girl spinning old-school gangster rap from 20 years ago...IRONICALLY. It's cool because you're superficial and don't expect her to play that. \n\nBunch of guys repping Extreme Sports fashion like Monster Energy caps with their Ed Hardy shirts...IRONICALLY. It's cool because no one seriously wears that anymore, and it's a great throwback to simpler times. \n\nNot much for pastafarianism, I tried chilling out with my modern, 2010s clothes and music taste. Didn't fit in. But fear not! Chilly Bombers has some redeeming aesthetics. Like...the pretty lights (so bright!). Or the huge (and unfortunately vacant) dance floor. \n\nWhen I closed my eyes just long enough to stop the spinning, I envisioned how much cooler this bar could be if it tried to be a little more dive-y, and a little less of a refuge for people too broke or afraid of Hurricane Bay*. \n\n*I can't believe I just used HB as a favorable alternative to something."
0,"I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, \""not too long.\"" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. \n\nOnce we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. \n\nI don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road."
1,"Let me preface this by saying that I've never been a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants. My sister loves Macayo's for some mysterious reason, and I decided to play along since we had relatives visiting from out of state.\n\nThe decor is nauseating. It feels like they took the most obnoxious colors they could find and ratcheted it up on the scale of tacky. However, we came to eat, so who cares what color the walls are?\n\nThe salsa is thin, but tolerable. Nothing special, but I'm always a fan of bottomless chips, so I'll take it.\n\nEveryone else seemed to like their food. I ordered tamales with green sauce. Unfortunately, the first time it came with their \""Baja sauce,\"" which our waitress informed us is cream cheese, heavy whipping cream and jalape\u00f1o juice. She quickly took it back and brought out my correct order. Much to my surprise, green sauce is just red sauce with green chiles in it. At this point, I had fallen behind enough that I scraped most of the sauce to the side and ate my lunch. The tamales had a nice fluffy texture, but the sauce was not what I had in mind.\n\nOur waitress did handle my sending back the order without any fuss. She was gracious and attentive, so for that I'm adding in an extra star."
1,It's pretty standard chain. Service leaves A LOT to be desired and you'll definitely find better.\n\nTurnaround is quick though and I don't spend a ton of time in the area so it's a quick go to that's right there.
1,"We usually call in to go ordrs as we did today. Speaker for pickup doesnt work, u just have to hope they see u on camera or youll be waiting.. hannah had wrong price so i couldnt contact on speaker- had to run in cause i forgot my cell. They gave me correct price, and my order. I get back to my van n check my bags. Hannah had forgotten half my ordr. No cheese crisp, xtra chips n salsa, and my entire carne asada chimi meal with rice and beans were no where to be found. So now, im making my second trip in cause again, speaker doesnt work. Mind u, hannah has only been out to my vehicle once and that was to get my name for my order and my credit card. I had already given her a $10 tip for my $37 order when i paid.  AND ive gone in and out twice cause she didnt properly check my bags. I shoulda asked her for change since i paid her tip cash. By the time i got back to my vehicle, my initial food brought out first was cold. Hub and I, as much as we like the food, have now sworn off this place for good. Customr service on to go is zero stars the only reason for two stars is the cooks know what theyre doing. Let me make a point of saying I always tip good rght away and normally this gets me good srvice. I pay cash tip even if i use cc just so i know they get it right away, and recognize it...like i said, they appreciate the consideration normally and i get good service.  I'll know better next time i guess. I checked my bags, i made sure ordr and pricng on receipt was correct, i did all the legwork...shoulda tipped myself!"
1,"No wonder great clips is taking their business. They just can't get it right. super cuts has a long ways to go in hiring quality stylists if they want to keep up. I have come out twice feeling something is off and I only come here when the Great clips line is too long\n\nThe hair stylists are always not always smiling, although the manager is friendly."
4,"In searching for more places to eat lunch on the north side of town, we came across Island Teriyaki.  It's an unassuming strip mall joint with a pretty straight forward menu.  Nothing terribly fancy, but it hits the spot every time.  Never seems to be overly crowded, I go with the Oahu rice bowl.  With the buy 6 bowls get 1 free promo I will be frequenting this place more and more, and may try something new along the way."
3,"Love this dive bar! Great service, lots of drink specials, and a very fun atmosphere. My favorite thing to do is play darts but they also have a shuffle board and a pool table.\n\nThis isn't the place to come if you're looking for great food or lots of televisions to watch all the games."
1,"Was driving down the street and saw the Einstein sign as I was almost about to pass it.  Luckily for me there were no other cars in my way and I veered across two lanes of traffic to make it into the parking lot.  The place was so deserted out front that I actually had to check Yelp to see if they were open, confirmed they were then made my way inside.  The place was completely empty so I made my way right to the front.  However once I got up to the counter there was no one there to help me.  Now, I'm not 100% sure a bell went off when I walked in but I'm pretty sure it did, you know, to alert the people in the back when someone walks in in just this kind of example.  I could hear a group of people talking and laughing in the back but no one was coming out to check on the front.  I also noticed a camera pointing at the counter, not sure if that's for management to watch the staff or for the staff to watch for customers but either way it wasn't helping me get a bagel any faster.\n\nAfter a few minutes a girl finally walked out to help me and didn't act very apologetic about the lack of service.  Once she took my order another girl went through the process of actually toasting and preparing my bagel and she was quick and polite.  The bagel itself was as good as I knew it would be and I'll go back to other locations but the service I received at this particular one will definitely prevent me from returning here."
3,"We came in here for dinner and really enjoyed it. I've ordered masala's at other places and they haven't made them as spicy as I like them to be, but here I ordered spicy chicken masala and I received a flavorful hot, SPICY chicken masala. Staff was very friendly and attentive.\nP.S.\nI Love Indian Food! ;-)"
3,"I've been coming here off and on over the years since it used to be right next to the theaters. The theaters are long gone and in place there is a church. The actual store is a lot bigger now. Pretty good selection of books. They have a lot of obscure foreign language/English dictionaries which I thought was pretty cool. That's probably just me though. They have a decent sized collection of vinyl for such a small place. A handful of CDs as well but nothing like the selection you would see at Bookman's. They will buy paperbacks, CDs and vinyl. Prices for what they give you seem a bit random though. Whatever the case, it is worth checking out from time to time."
0,"I have been here before and the selection is okay and the people fine. I went in to sell some books today and the old woman behind the front desk was down-right rude. On top of that, she just meandered around as if we all had all the time in the world while she moved books back and forth between shelves. It was definitely a wasted trip for me and one that I will not ever again repeat. Next time I will go back to Bookmans."
1,"First, I hate any kind of scamming. This is a bar where a lot of locals know one another. I play a lot of music in the juke box and I've been here to specifically play their great juke box and the fact they carry my beer, MGD 64. The happy hour prices are decent, $2.50 a bottle. The staff is friendly. They have 99 cent sliders on Tuesdays and Thursdays, otherwise, they don't have any reduced priced appetizers. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, between 5:00-7:00, the bottles are suppose to be $1.75. I've been in here about 10 times.  10 times I was over charged for either food and/or drinks. These were blatent over charges. I had a coupon for 35 cent wings. I ordered 10 wings. Total should be $3.50. It's not difficult to order 10 wings at 35 cents a piece. They charged me $5.75. I brought this up to the bartender and she kept debating with me that 10 wings at 35 cents each were  $5.75.  35 cents x 10= 5.75?  They follow a chart that's taped to their cash register. She kept saying I was the only person in 3 years to ever complain about the pricing of the wings!!! I said then maybe I'm the only person in 3 years to see that you're overcharging everyone. It was eventually fixed after others in the bar started hearing the conversation, but they didn't agree with me that 35cents x 10= 3.50. The last time I went in a couple weeks ago, I specifically went for the $1.75 beers between 5-7. They charged me for full price happy hour even though I was there on the \""special 1.75 day\"". I've had buy 1 get one free coupons for here, and the free meal was never taken off. I've had to correct this many times. So, I like the atmosphere. It's very casual, decent drink specials, really no food specials, and a great juke box. They do have a very small free buffet with 2 things on it, but it's always gone and not re-filled. As long as you watch your bill and prices closely, it's a decent place to go. I would've rated them a 3 1/2  if it weren't for every bill being wrong."
0,"Trashy dive bar,.gross skanky waitresses who think they are hot,mediocre food, terrible service, only good thing is cheap drinks during happy hour.Also rude doorman.Not worth it."
2,"Going to Padre Murphy's on Fridays for Fish and Chips is a tradition and somewhat a routine for loads of peeps in northwest Phoenix. I had to try it. My first visit was for lunch with a coworker and have been back a couple of times for their Fish & Chips on Fridays. \n\nIt's somewhat of a dated sports bar but with lots of cool sports pics on the walls and plenty of great TVs everywhere to watch sports, horse and dog races. Plenty of room, clean and inviting and even has a couple of betting windows for the race tracks. Their service is exceptional and very consistent with each visit. The crowd is somewhat of an older, couples crowd but kid friendly. \n\nPadre Murphy's bottomless Fish and Chips on Friday has a great taste and it is what a lot of peeps keep coming back for. I've tried some of their Irish dishes and found them to be average or below compared to other places. Their sandwiches and burgers are OK and their open faced roast beef plate is one of their best sellers. But I, like most peeps come here for their Fish & Chips on Fridays. \n\nMaybe I will see you there sometime on a Friday eating Fish & Chips ;-)"
2,"I am torn in writing this review because I have been going to Padre Murphy's for years without issue but my last visit really disappointed.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered burgers for lunch - I got the party melt and he had the mushroom burger. I have ha these before and they were always delicious so I thought it was a sure fire bet.\n\nWe both ordered are burgers medium well. When the food came out, it took the waiter a long time to check on us - I ended up calling him over. My burger was very dry and the party was swallowed up by the bread and bland fried onions. It was also cooked well done, but I didn't feel like waiting for another burger because we had our daughter with us. I didn't say anything to my husband but asked for ketchup for the burger. Then my husband mentioned that his burger was dry and overcooked and he didn't want to eat it so we called the waiter over again. At this point, I kindly reminded him that we had ordered our burgers medium well and these were clearly well. He then started arguing with me. He said if I wanted it slightly pink I should have ordered it medium rare! I told him my experience has always been that slightly pink was medium well. Nonetheless, we asked for a new burger for my husband. By the time it came out, we needed to leave so we asked for it to be put in a box. It was - and with nothing else - no fries or anything. We didn't get an apology, we didn't talk to a manager and we didn't get a discount on the bill. The only thing that really bothered me was the arguing... After all, it's not the waiters fault if the food is overcooked.\n\nOne last thing - I ordered a tall mixed drink and got a short instead... Minor but relevant.\n\nThis was the first time I've been really disappointed here but it was enough to make me write a review. Normally the food and service is great and we love to be able to take part in OTB. Let's hope it's better next time!"
2,The pool looks nicer than it used to. Music still sucks.
1,Please update your hours on Yelp. We stopped by to get something framed at 5:32pm and you were closed even though it said 6pm on Yelp.
0,"Just came in. Two people in front of me. Waited. Someone else came in. Large man appears from behind counter, moves to help the people who came in after me. I said \""Need a ...\"" but the people who came on after me were served first. I have bought Iphone batteries, watch batteries here but my next order will be online."
4,"I've been coming to this place for the last 5 years, the staff is always friendly and this place is really clean. The barbers are very professional and well trained. This isn't one of those gay salon's that will massage your head while giving you a reach around, this is a real mans salon. \n\nIf you just want to get a fucking haircut with no lame gimmicks, then this is the place for you!"
0,"Ugh!  I think I am going to be sick!  Please let the record reflect that I did not choose this restaurant.  It was chosen as a meeting place by my sister-in-law sight unseen.  \n\nLocated in kind of a dingy strip mall, the place was pretty full on a Sunday night.  We took this as a good sign.  The staff was friendly and was very good about bringing drink refills and clearing plates.  The restaurant was relatively clean.\n\nLet's get down to the heart of eating out, though, which is FOOD.  The food ranged from unexceptional to bad.  The eggrolls, jalapeno chicken, and fried wantons were not bad, but nothing special.  The coconut shrimp was the best thing  I ate and was actually tasty, but very heavy and greasy.  The hot and sour soup was okay.\n\nDo not be tempted by the sushi.  I am skeptical anytime I see sushi at a buffet, but decided to try it anyway.  It was TERRIBLE!  The one nigiri I had was just awful.  The fish was not fresh and the rice was bland.  The one California type roll was similarly AWFUL.  I hope that sushi virgins are not getting this as their first taste of sushi, because it will turn them off to sushi forever.\n\nThe other items to choose from were standard Chinese buffet fare, but bland and greasy.  Nothing special here.  I was too afraid to try very much.\n\nAfter eating at Great Wall Buffet, I feel cheap and dirty, but I did not even enjoy the experience.  If I am going to be so bad, it had better be so good."
0,an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible. you will see bundt cake straight from KFC. and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it?!
1,"The food was just okay some of it was better than others. My problem is it looks like he's hiring his family that really don't know anything about the food service business. I seen one waiter bringing some food put it on some else's table first because he couldn't hold all the plates, then he moved it to the other person's table. This is because the seating Is so close together I can hear the people next to me you chew their food not to mention every conversation they're having. He tried to liven up the place by having a live steel drummer playing which would be nice if he wasn't sitting right on top of me also. If you going to have people sit this close together dim the lights put some candles on the table or remove some of the tables and give me some space!!"
2,"This place is just OK.  Heavy flavors, etc.  There is pork in the meatballs, which is not mentioned on the menu.\n\nWe have been there twice for happy hour.  It's only worth it because you get appetizers for 1/2 off, drinks/beer are 1/2 off, and house wines are 33% off.  The 1/2-priced appetizers are only available in the bar area.  I wouldn't go there for the full-price menu."
1,"I've eaten here before with varied experiences, but my girlfriend wanted to go out for New Year's Eve dinner so we went.  Prior to arriving she made a \""reservation\"" / \""call ahead seating\"" or whatever they call it at this place.  We arrived at 7:58 for our 8:00 \""seating\"" and there were only two couples waiting.  This should have been my first clue as every other time I've been here the place has been crowded.  Even though there were only two couples waiting, we were told it would be 15 minutes (you could clearly see empty tables).  At 8:19 our pager went off to be seated (kind of funny they gave us this since we were ten feet from their stand and as stated earlier there were only a few couples waiting).  As we walked to our table, I noted seven empty tables and had only seen two parties leave.  I'm trying to account for why we waited so long when we had a \""reservation\"" and there were empty tables. Oh well, let's just enjoy the meal.  My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo and I the Conchiglie Formaggi.  They both arrived just warm (the restaurant was particularly cold last night) and our server didn't offer fresh grated parmesan. Both dishes were bland but were palatable, hence the \""Meh, I've experienced better\"".  Truly the best part was the fact my belly was no longer growling and we could head out for a great New Year's Eve celebration."
2,"This is my neighborhood Sprouts.  The one time manager of this store used to live downstairs from me and I had no clue what he did for a living until long after he accepted a position with another company.  After I found out what he did I mentioned I had only been in 2 Sprouts and had liked the produce in the first one I went to (83rd and T-Bird) but when the new one opened at 51st and Peoria, on my way home, I had been disappointed in the quality of the produce and had never gone back.  He explained you do not want to buy meat and produce from a place that does not have lines at the register because they do not turn the inventory fast enough.  He suggested I go a little out of my way and try his old store which does a much higher volume.  If I am in the area I will also still stop by 83rd and T-Bird as they do even more volume.  Some of their stuff is a little high priced but for price shopping I go to Wal-mart or Costco.\n\nSo what do I like to buy there?  Produce, pork brats, fish (Friday I got swordfish), several times a year they have buffalo, chocolate covered raisins (I really have to watch myself). They have Muir Glen ketchup (no corn syrup and great taste).  I have tried some of their breads and chips and not been impressed.\n\nI do not go often but I am glad I took my neighbor's advice and tried them again.  And I have never had more than 3 people in front of me in line."
4,"The evolution of supermarkets towards fresh produce, gluten-free products, organic products when possible, and competitive prices has been a boon to Sprouts.  This is a local chain on the verge of exploding onto the national scene in a big way.\n\nSprouts recently went public and with good reason.  They have 170 stores, primarily on west coast and a rabid customer base. These stores rock!  They are super clean, super competitive and have a fantastic selection of groceries.\n\nThe produce is some of the finest you'll find in town; it's always top notch quality at very good prices.  The meat counter is amazing.  Trust me on this, their chicken sausage (about five flavors but choose the caliente) is fantastic.  We use it a couple of times a month in our spicy pasta dish with mini penne.  The fish is always fresh, it never smells fishy, and the wrapped meat in the case is beautiful and always delicious.\n\nThe general merchandise section has one of the largest selections of natural and homeopathic vitamins and supplements in the valley and an educated staff to help guide your purchases.  \n\nThey have a wonderful selection of bulk foods that has got to be the highest quality bulk in the valley.  The chocolate covered (you name it, walnuts, almonds, raisins, peanuts, etc) are fantastic!  It's a great way to buy just the quantity you need, at a great price.\n\nI've shopped at nearly all of the West side Sprouts and none of them will disappoint you; this is a quality chain that is going to be around for a long, long time."
1,"It's amazing that no matter what me and my family do we can't walk out the door for no less than $30. The food is good , not great. The new cost cutting measures include the servers putting ALL ICE in your cups and 10% soda , and putting a layer of cheese so thin on the pizzas that it's stupid. New employees , same complete idiot type. A girl who came to our table on the same night , served us 2 different pizzas that we didn't order. Then she seemed like she was \""disrespected\"" when we pointed out that the pizza's weren't the ones we ordered. Just save your money. I agree with tabatha , I've lost about 20 pounds since I've stopped eating at major food chains that have taken gross amounts of cost cutting. There's more cheese on the pizzas from the taco bell menus that have pizza hut. Seriously! you get more cheese on that little pre made pizza that comes from the PH factory that what they put on the pizzas when they're making them \""fresh\"". Last one I had smelt like corn chips at this location.\n\nsave your money."
1,"$13.83 for a Tosted mac & cheese No meat.... but they charge like if it had shrimp!   I won't order this again. .. over priced, small portion,  and it's not even the best I ever had."
3,Thunderbird Pools is definitely better than the big pool companies like Paddock and Shasta.\n\n-Estimate was very straight forward. I told them what I wanted and he gave me an estimate for the work. All the other pool companies kept trying to sell me up and telling me how I needed this and that. \n-Estimate was equal if not cheaper\n-Didn't charge extra for doing simple things like removing the diving board and bolts that was no longer needed after remodel (other pool companies wanted an extra $200 just to do that!)\n-Work was done quickly and on time\n-Had some issues with the pool light but they fixed in a good manner
4,"I love, love, love Tokyo Lobby!  I go there at least once a week for lunch or dinner.  It is a little jewel in a strip mall that I though was my little secret :)\n\nThe restaurant was introduced to us about 2 years ago through a friend's ex, but that's another story.  At that time it was in a much smaller space, but within the last year they have relocated to a much nicer location.  \n\nThe sushi is phenomenal!  The best I have had in the valley, and I have tried many.  The rolls are to die for - large, flavorful, fresh and they never skimp on portion size or taste.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  Good sake, many flavors and sake bombers - hey why not? \n\nMust try: baby lobster roll, crunch roll, monkey brains and heart attack\n\n(mmmm...i'm salivating just thinking about it!)"
4,"I LOVE sushi! And I love it even more when it is from Tokyo Lobby.  I eat here at least once a week, budget be damned.  I can't help it. I'm addicted.  I probably need some kind of support group. I'm all about the soft shell crab and the blue fin. I am also a big fan of their bento boxes.  You get a lot for your buck.  And for appetizers, the Heart Attack is great (never in a million years would I have thought I would be paying for a heart attack).  I usually go as they are opening, because once lunch hour hits, an available seat will be impossible. You should really give this place a try, it is a real treat."
4,"This place is great whether you like sushi or not. I am not a fish eater, but my boyfriend is. I always order their chicken teriyaki with vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of it is always excellent. My boyfriend orders the California roll (either regular or tempura coated), the spicy tuna roll, and many others. He says it's very good as well. The service is always great and the atmosphere is nice. It's a small place, maybe 15 tables plus the sushi bar. It's not fancy, but it's a nice weekly dining experience that's affordable and great food. Be advised though, they do close from 3-5pm to prepare for dinner service."
1,"It was okay, but \""Meh, I've experienced better.\"" We were a party of 6 on a Thursday night. They made it clear that they close by 9:30pm and that they were ready for us to go. However,the server was pretty friendly and fast.\n\nThe food was just okay. The rolls were very average at best, not tightly rolled. The Catepillar roll had a very sweet eel sauce (more like a maple flavored sauce) and it was hard to eat. We had to remind them that our order was not all complete...perhaps in the rush to get our food out so we could leave by the time they closed, they may have overlooked or order. \n\nI'm confused about how this place got such high reviews, since they didn't even come close in my experience."
0,The sushi was not at all good. The service was on the poor side. Our one and only visit was not enjoyable.
1,"Nothing special, really.  The prices were great, especially the $5 Sake Bomber special.  But overall, the food was just not sexy at all."
4,"I am new to Arizona, and this is the first Dentist I've been to here. The staff is very friendly, the office is clean and inviting. I had a very pleasant cleaning on my teeth this morning (didn't leave my gums swollen like others). The prices are very reasonable and I will be using them again. Certainly recommended!"
2,Went there for my daughters birthday and she loved it. We finished our meal tipped the cook at our table paid and was outside talking when the waitress came out and complained we didn't tip her enough cause half her tip goes to the cook. Are you kidding me how is that my problem. And when was it ok to follow customers outside and ask for more money. I was so pissed and shocked that I will never go back to that place again.
0,"Whatta bummer this place is!!  I saw it on DDD and it looked like it was going to be the best BBQ the world has ever produced.   Lucky for me I was heading to my grandpas in Tucson so Thee Pitts Again was only about 45 min out of my way (That's nothing when it comes to good BBQ).  Maybe it was because I was there on a Tuesday at about 11AM and I got all the leftovers from say ummm.......Saturday.  Stupid me I asked the waitress what's good to which I received the standard answered of \""Everything\"" so that's what I ordered give me 1 of everything.   She returned with a huge plate probably weighing 6 pounds everything looked the same, I couldn't really tell what was what.  I think I had about 1 bite of each item paid my $30 tab and went to Weinerschnitzl for some good food."
2,"I was a bit disappointed with the pulled pork. It seemed to be a tad under-cooked. It had a nice smoke ring but there was a lot of fat in my sandwich.\n\nThe atmosphere is great and the waiter was helpful and friendly. With all the self-promotion about all the BBQ competitions they have won, you think their pulled pork would better than what I could make in my backyard.\n\nMy wife leaned over and said, \""Your BBQ is better than this!\"" I guess I'll have to try the ribs or the brisket next time."
3,"Stopped in here for lunch yesterday... and had the pulled pork sandwich with the sole slaw... on an onion roll. Had the baked beans as a side... and of course Sweet Tea! \n\nI loved it. It was so damn good. The meal was about 9 bucks... a little steep in my opinion for a sandwich. The beans were really delicious with little morsels of BBQ beef in it. Unfortunately, I do not get out to this part of town too often, so i do not get to take advantage of all the BBQ goodness Thee Pitts has to offer. \n\nI am glad I get to check off another one of the Dinner, Drivins, and Dives restaurant off my list of must tries!"
2,Saw it on triple D finally got to try it I got the combo platter lots of meat in the dish. The meat was very good except the sliced ham tasted like turkey ham. Beef rib was not good either sides need work got corn on cob very over boiled. Wife got coleslaw said it was very bland. Overall not bad would go back but would get the chopped meat. Also BBQ sauce a little ketcupy.
1,Eh - not bad...but not anything to write home about.
2,"Hidden little nook, right next to JcPenny (on the south west side). \n\nIf you are anything like me & don't own a needle & thread (it's sad, I know!) then this is a good place to go if you need to have something hemmed or tailored.\nThey also do embroidery, although that can get a bit price if you are wanting an intricate or large design. My daughter had her best friends initials embroidered onto a small bag & it was $15, reasonable I think, & it came out really nice! It does add a little something extra & makes gifts more personal & thoughtful :)  \n\nAn important note, so you won't be caught off guard, this store works on CASH only & requires pre-payment. \n\nDuring the holiday season the turn around time was 1 week, but maybe now that it's over the wait time is less."
2,"first impression? the couch in the waiting area is filthy and there's no hostess to be found. \n\nwe sat down and received chips and two salsa. we also received two cups and a pitcher of water and then the nice lady walked away. i guess we pour our own water? ok.  not gonna lie, it was kinda messy. we pretty much sucked at trying to pour water. haha\n\neverything on the menu was around $15 which was a bit shocking considering the no greeting, the self serve water and the dirty couch in the lobby.  i guess the feeling i got from the place i was expecting it would be closer to $10 menu items? \n\nour waiter came out quickly and he was the only waiter on the floor. he did surprisingly well. i never felt like we were lacking when it came to needing something. \n\nmy steak fajitas were super tasty-  they let the veggies get crispy and there's nothing worse than soggy veggies. the tortillas were amazing. and overall i was happy with my dinner. it was huge so that $15 plate did stretch for a few meals and it really was worth it because the quality is there for sure (i'm leaving out my complaint about the brownish quac and pale pico de gallo bc i didn't eat them and the fajitas were great on their own)\n\nit was definitely a good choice for dinner. it was a decent family owned restaurant.\n\ni just wish the rest of the experience was relevant to the price of the food. the food is worth the price but the rest was a bit off for me. \n\nin the end- after tip it ended up being about $20 per person. i would probably go again if i was in the area and needing some good mexican food. other than that, probably not. it was a-ok and if they upped the rest of the experience i would most definitely be a fan!"
2,"We came here for Valentine's day because my husband's sprint phone was not working.   We drop off the phone and walked over for a quick bite.  We were lucky we got there before the crowd.  We waited for a few mins, before we were greeted and sat.  Within 15 mins, the place was packed with people.  \n\nWe sat down and received a basket of warm chips and two salsa.  Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.  The lady did not say anything to us and left.  I was not sure if she is coming back or not.  ???  \n\nThen our server came to greet us.  She was very nice and told us the special.  She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.  She had a ton of tables.  She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.  \n\nI ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.  The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.  \n\nTo sum up everything, it was ok."
0,"Just ate at this shit box, Ajo Al's in Glendale. Very disappointed in our dinning experience. I wish I'd have read some of the reviews before going. The only positive I have is that the interior was aesthetically pleasing. Completely downhill from there. We ordered two margaritas, on the rocks, with two shots of Grand Marnier. It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks and the shots of Grand Marnier were only a 1/2 oz. each. We had to request a full one oz. shot, and wait another 10 minutes for it to transpire. The food was nothing spectacular, if not overpriced. At the end of the meal we ordered two more margaritas, this time melon, and again a we waited. Our empty plates and glass wear were never cleared from the table. When we left, the remanence from everything we ordered was still on the table, and everything took exceedingly long... Do not waist your time and money if you are expecting any kind of good dining experience.\nI've had better \""generic brand salsa\"", and I doubt if they even know what a jalapeno is."
1,"Very dissappointed with the customer service. Went there on Friday, 11/15/13 with my family. The waitress spent most of her time trying to upsale. She encouraged us to get extra cream cheese with out pollo con queso (in which we ordered 3). We did, and of course we were charged for the extra cream cheese. My son ordered the kids meal and I explained to her that it comes with a free drink. She already inputted the charge and stated that she would speak with her manager. She never removed the item from the bill. Normally, we overtip on our bill. We usually leave approximately 15% if the service was poor. We left an $11 tip on our bill that was $70.44 ($81.44 after tip) due to the poor service. I checked my bank account today and noticed that our waitress added an extra $1. Total amount charged was $82.44. Ajo Al's just lost a customer for life."
1,"Had you asked me to write the review after my first visit I would have given three stars.  Now that we have been back for a second stop, it has dropped to a 2 star experience. \n\nBiggest plus - the chips are hot fresh and the salsas are tasty.\n\nHowever, the entress are just a soupy mess of sauce, beans, rice and whatever you ordered.  It seems they plate the food, then throw it under a broiler or heat lamp to perfectly melt everything into one congealed mess.  Flavor is jsut ok, as the two stars say, \""meh, I've experienced better.\""\n\nStill on the quest for a better upscale Mexican Dinning experience.  Somewhere where they rice and beans are not one big mess covered in sauce and sour cream.  Somewhere where they take the time to plate a nice plate of food."
1,".......Where are the chopsticks?\n\nA Chinese restaurant is clearly not Chinese when there are no chopsticks on the place setting! Tea was lukewarm upon arrival, tasted unauthentic, with the help of any ambiguous American tea bag. The hot and sour soup had peas...peas! Side of rice was stiff and tasted as if it had been in the cooker all day. Had the stir fry vegetable dish that consisted of broccoli, snow peas and mushrooms overly cooked to mush; where was my bok choy or kai lan or any type of actual authentic Chinese vegetables?!\n\nOne thing I do give them credit for: service was clean, fast, and efficient.\n\nOther than that, your money's better off at Panda Express right down the street. Same quality of food, and at least there you won't have to pay for tip!"
0,Wife and daughter ate here and got food poisoning. They had the shrimp lo mein. Beware!
1,"When we first moved to Arizona we lived in Ahwatukee and Abacus Inn was on restaurant of choice on Elliot and 48th.   Fast forward 20 years and one pops in closer to us so we thought we would give it a try.  \nI liked it, she didn't.  It wasn't the same as we remembered.  Maybe we aged.  Maybe they did.  The place is tiny and packed.  There appears to be a brisk take-out business happening.   The menu appears to be \""lite\"" on menu options and not like other Chinese joints where there are endless pages of options.  \nWe preferred Shanghai on 67th and Happy Valley (in the Fry's shopping Center) as our favorite Chinese in the Northwest side.  \nThere is some serious commentary needed and it's how these Chinese restaurants seem to make take out orders, over in restaurant orders.   They must teach them that in Chinese Food school but I have seen full packed restaurants of people waiting up to an hour + for food, while the take out is brisk.  I have seen people walk in, order takeout and then sit and eat it whiles others wait.   I'm not sure why they do this, but all Chinese joints seem to partake in this mistake."
4,"My favourite Chinese Restaurant. Better than PF or any of that nonsense. I order the Orange Chicken, Chicken Chow Mein or Mu Shu Pork and I love them all! I crave this place and its deliciousness, maybe it's the addictive MSG but for once, I don't even care! \n\nOn my last visit, the owner gave everyone a Chinese Calendar as a holiday gift which was kind! Fair warning, some of the staff are strange but most of them a great! \n\nYou should go there now."
1,"This place drives me nuts!  It's very convenient for me to drop in and I'm mostly satisfied with their food, it's just that they are so slooooow in the drive-thru.  On my last visit I couldn't even order at the menu.  I had to roll up to the window and give my order.  It's not that the menu wasn't working, the gal just wasn't listening or hearing me correctly or something.  I had a question and apparently questions don't fly out at the menu.  When I got to the window and asked \""can you leave a few fries w/o chili on them?\"" the look she gave me was complete bewilderment - like nobody had ever asked her a question before.  Frustrating.  I'll go here again because it's on the right side of the freeway, on my way everywhere."
1,"This is NOT the famous Grimaldis pizza that everyone hears about.  There's a fuss over who gets to use the name, presumably it's either the location on Scottsdale Rd. or the new location just off the 101 at Northern in Peoria.  Either way, this is not the famous Grimaldis.\n\nPizza is very average.  Service is usually poor, and usually from teenage kids with little to no training as servers.  In fact, it's unclear whether it is full serve or not.  Sometimes you have to go up to the counter to order, and other times they correct your behavior and insist that you sit down first.\n\nPizza by the slice isn't so great in the afternoon hours because it is reheated stuff from much earlier with a drizzle of fresh cheese put on top of the old, starting to form skin crusted cheese.\n\nAfternoon happy hour attracts an unsavory crowd looking for cheap chicken wings and light beer.\n\nFamily owned, but who cares if the service is often bad and the food isn't so great."
3,I love this place - I was so happy to finally find a decent restaurant in the West Valley.  Love that its a local business.  Pizza is great and I've heard so many great reviews about the rest of the menu.  Great casual local neighborhood restaurant!  Great customer service and prices too!
1,Chairs are uncomfortable... The only time they act like they understand  or speak English is when your talking about price & times up for massage.  I liked the cucumber scrub & didn't have to wait long.  Not a bad place to go if in the area but I've been to a lot better.
4,Great coffee. Free refills just keep your receipt. Hazelnut coffee?! with more hazelnut? I'm in heaven. I also got bottom of the pot coffee and my mouth is tingling from the caffeine. LOL. The bagels here are also worth the price.
2,"It's hit or miss at this particular store. At lunchtime-it's great. At dinnertime-not so much. You can definitely tell the difference between the lunch and dinner crew. The line is kept up and the store is clean at lunch. The tables are bussed and the drinks are kept full at lunch. At dinner..again not so much. \n\nSoups are very good, bread items are ok, hot foods are not very good in selection and just blah at best. The salad bar is fresh though and the selection is plentiful. \n\nThe servers are again very hit or miss. The lunch crew is nice and personable. The dinner crew--well let's just say they spend A LOT of time in the back....hiding. This would be ok if we could get our own drinks, but when you depend on a server to bring you a drink and your glass has been empty for 1/2 hour...not so much. \n\nThe best part about Souper Salad is the price. The \""other\"" salad bar is almost $10 per person and that is just insane for salad. The \""not so much\"" parts about Souper Salad are a bit more tolerable when the price is not an arm and a leg."
1,"Souper Salad always leaves you slightly dissatisfied. Not that I believe the competition is much better but there are some definite improvements that could push Souper Salad up a few notches. \n\n1. Clean plates and silverware. - we typically are left sorting through the stack of plates to look for one without cling on leftovers. This goes for silverware as well.\n\n2. More adequate staffing. - Every time we have gone to Souper Salad (which is quite often) we are forced to wait at the register for 2 - 10 minutes while the floor attendant carries drinks to seated patrons and removes dirty trays. There is one lady who has been working here forever with long brown hair. She seems to take on the majority of the workload. This last weekend there was what appeared to be a younger lady manager who seemed very uninterested in assisting at the register or anywhere else for that matter.\n\n3. Bread station refills - The bread is almost always empty or near empty forcing you to watch until bread is set out and then battle the other customers to get a lousy breadstick.\n\nI noticed that Souper Salad recently attempted a minor facelift. While under \""construction\"" the place looked a bit like a crime scene and I half expected a chalk outline on the floor. The big reveal did not do much to make up for the cosmetic disarray. There were maybe a few new pictures added (no more creepy dancing veggies) but I didnt notice many upgrades other than that. Regardless, you get what you pay for and considering you can feed a family of 3 for less than $20 you can't expect 5 star dining, but I won't be giving Souper Salad a 5 star rating either."
3,"= = = = = =  CLOSED!  = = = = = =\n\nSo sad, so sad...  we've lost yet another Souper Salad!     :-((     There were 16 of them in the Valley a while back & now we're down to THREE!  The problem?  THEY DON'T CHARGE ENOUGH FOR THE BUFFET!!  I certainly hope they'll finally see the light & raise the price a couple dollars at the remaining locations so we'll still have them around to enjoy!     :-O"
3,"Okay everyone, I've been doing business with these guys for a little over a year now and have done quite a bit of business with them. So you're probably asking why 4 stars and not 5? Well they don't deserve a 5. \n\nAs you read through the rest of these reviews, there's a person in this store with a little bit of an attitude. The old man and chuck are cool and willing to help, especially when you grow balls and start experimenting with new recipes or need help. \n\nI continue to go back because these 2 guys. I also like small business and the personal touch to that business. I am like some people on here though. I have tinkered with the idea of doing business online as I really don't like the snobbish attitude of the one guy that works there sometimes.\n\nOverall they normally have what you need.\n\nHope this helps."
0,"The cheapest, most tasteless mexican food I've ever had. Very greasy,\nhorrible cheese."
3,"Been in here more times than I can count.  Likely have a stake at this point in one of the boilers...\n\nThere is a rhythm to this place.  Like a hectic Starbucks (do these exist anymore?) or the DMV.  Bottom line is that It takes a few passes to get the swing of it.  Don't roll in all Einsteins-fresh and go \""hey, what about my microwave heated egg patty?!?!?\""\n\nGet to know this little gem and let them get to know you.  It's a dance people, it takes a few turns to get it.  After that, I believe you will experience a excellent value, consistency, and yes - friendly and helpful staff that I look forward to saying \""good morning\"" too.  \n\nBTW - one of the few places that will keep me drinking hot coffee in the summer due to their Kona!"
4,Any type of fresh bagel and bagel sandwich you can think of. They are always fresh and use only boars head meats and cheeses. New York style deli that is simply delicious.
4,"This is a great place to sit and have lunch with friends.  It's always busy but the service is fast.  Staff is very friendly, in fact, my daughter of 2 years use to go in with me all the time and they would always acknowledge her.\n\nI never pay over $7 for breakfast or lunch, and the deli meat is excellent quality.  I would definitely recommend it."
2,Superb bagel just wish they would cut back on the salt. Then I could patronize them more often.
4,"If you're craving for bagels or breakfast, you need to go here and eat every / any bagel you can think of."
3,"oOoh I'm giving this place four stars based solely on how fancy, organized and the quality of the produce and meats are...and they have this really lovely bakery inside...I would like to try it one day. As for the service...I am not very content with...why? because....\n\nSo I was at the Butcher Corner's section looking at the selections of great beef cuts...I was pretty happy they have Filet Mignon and they looked like pretty good quality...and well for $26/lb they should be! Well so I've been standing there for awhile and there was a person behind the counter...I knew that knew that I was there but he didn't say anything. Then another person (old white Caucasian male) walks around the area just browsing..automatically the butcher guy asks him if he needs help...when I have been standing there for like 2 minutes. I was a little offended. \n\nAnyways besides that...this place is the equivalent of Bristol Farms in LA. This market has all the exotic and fine ingredients to make a delicious meal. =)"
1,"I have been using this facility for several years.  The doctor's service has been fine, however the office has continually gotten worse.  When calling the office it is usually a minimum wait of 20 minutes.  Several times I have been disconnected.  I feel they need to get better or more office workers who appreciate a persons time."
4,"I have been going to Sakanas for years now, and can say that I have yet to have anything short of a great experience there! \n\nThe sushi is fantastic, very high quality and fresh! They give you huge pieces of fish for a very affordable price. The rolls ate delicious as well, they always have cool specials that can be seen on their whiteboard behind the sushi bar. The lunch special is fantastic, you can get plenty of rolls for very cheap! \n\nAlso, the service is always awesome. Yoshie, a manager, is always walking around greeting everyone and checking on you during your meal. She seems to know almost all her customers, and makes everyone feel important.\n\nI give them 5 starts for service, food quality, portion size, and prices, Sakanas is the best!!"
4,We went here for lunch while on vacation.  The food was great and the portions were quite large.  3 of us at for $30 plus tip.
2,"I was a loyal Sakana fan for years up until the birth of my sone.  Going out for sushi is not so convenient with a lil one. So after a 3 year hiatus, my husband and I opted for Sakana on date night.  Would it be all that we remembered? Disappointed to say that it wasn't. We sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were not as personable as they were in the past - very little banter or recommendations. The saving grace was the scallop dynamite - the best I have had in the Valley and the oranges for dessert. Gosh how I missed those.  \nI accept that maybe a 3 year break might have built up my expectations."
3,"Pleasantly surprised here to say the least.  My local classmates brought me here since it was near our campus and when I saw sushi in a strip mall in the middle of the Arizona desert, I was skeptical.  But this place was the real deal on the inside and beyond offering standard fare, presented a number of interesting specials that really got my attention.  Lobster and Miso soup, soft-shell crab, spicy tuna handrolls and real, fresh wasabi made this place stand out.  I would go so far as to call it a sushi oasis in the desert!"
2,"Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant."
3,"I really like that this place is always busy, but not busy enough for the staff to accommodate you. Every time I've eaten here I've gotten excellent service... and food! \n\nI've mostly tried their pasta dishes and haven't disappointed with any of them so far. If I'm on a (rare) healthy kick I'll order their flank steak salad, which is still awesome. Also love their Italian sodas - Hurricane is my fave. \n\nThis is my new place to go for Italian and a definite must-try!"
0,"I used to love this place. When it first opened (when it was half the size it was now, and they had BYOB because they didn't have an alcohol license), we really enjoyed it. The servers were friendly and fast, and the manager walked around and checked on all her guests.\n\nWhat the heck happened? This was my go-to spot during weekdays around lunch, when me and the girls would go in for their lunch special (a salad and pasta or pizza for $9). Slowly, this place was going from one of my favorite places, to somewhere I would avoid. There is no reason to have rude, ignorant waiters who know nothing about the new items they've added to their menu, or how to use a register. \n\nDespite this, because it's so close, me and a couple friends went in to get the lunch special. We were seated immediately in a cool area under an air vent (thank God) and our drink orders were taken as a server (a young blonde girl) introduced herself. It took six minutes for our drinks to get to the table, while we watched her chatting with a guy at the bar.\n\nWhen we took our orders, I got my usual. I love their Spring salad, I always get it every time I come in, because it's always delicious - and the pasta martini, which my whole family enjoys when we come in. Our food came out quick, and our bill came out shortly.\n\nHowver, when we had asked for a split bill, she must have forgotten. We had all gotten the same thing (the lunch special and a soda) so we gave her our debit cards so she could split them up at the register. She brought back our bills to sign and return our cards when I noticed my bill said $17?! Umm, no?! I immediately corrected her, and she told me she would remove that from my card and replace it with my bill. I left a small tip and left.\n\nThe next day, I went on to check my bank account. Not ONLY had I been charged the 17 for someone else's order, but the additional 13.50 from mine!!!  THIRTY DOLLARS?! I called the manager and she asked for my reciept. When I explained I did not have it (she hadn't brought me one), she told me she could not help me, even though I offered to print out my bank statement. \n\nI doubt I will ever come back to this location. I much prefer the location in uptown, where the servers are friendly and out of high school."
3,Best creamy chicken pesto pasta I have had in a while.  Steak and pesto is also an option.  Great atmosphere and lighting.  Fast service and bread is to die for.  A nice Italian eatery in a Safeway shopping center.
2,It's hard to get pasta wrong. Its also hard to stick out. Babbo does neither. A distinctly average yet affordable dining option located north of the 101 loop. They have lunch specials and decent pizza and wine.
0,"Went early tonight, Wed., to beat the crowd but we beat the main cook. Salad was wilted, main course lacked flavor other than the taste of the scorched vegetables. Our previous visit was just ok but this was our last visit."
0,"Incredibly rude service from Andrea on Sept. 13. Clearly annoyed I was\n\""interrupting her\"" to make my purchase. I will not use this location ever again."
0,"Worst store I've ever been to. They never have anything in stock, they refuse to honor discounts, and they have the rudest staff I've ever encountered. Hope this place goes out of business."
4,"Groomingdales is a wonderful local grooming store for your pet. Robin and Sean the owners are genuine people who care about animals and will treat your pet as if it is their own. I love the environment that the animal is not kept in a cage and can have free reign of the shop while they are waiting for their turn at grooming. I also took my Chloe (yorkie) in for daycare yesterday and when I picked her up at the end of the day, she was good and tired from having a fun filled day. Stop in and chat with Robin or Sean and get to know them, you won't regret it. Lastly - their address for their shop has moved, the Yelp administrator hasn't approved the address change - they are now located on 17224 N. 43rd avenue. Less than a mile from their previous location, just right over on 43rd, just North of Bell on the west side."
1,"I went to this cleaners for alteration to a gown. They told me they would alter the hem of the gown for $10-15, which I thought was a great deal because I had just been quoted $30. I left the dress and was told it would be ready by Thursday (I needed it for an event that day). I was called on Wednesday saying the cost was actually about $50, and would not be ready until Friday. I asked for the dress back but the dress was at a different location and they could not have it back to me. My plan was to take it to another location to get hemmed. Given the short amount of time, I ended up having them alter the gown although it was expensive. I ended up wearing a different gown since, although it was ready by Thursday, it was too late and I couldn't pick it up. The manager only gave me a 10%-15%. As good business practice, she should have given me the original price I was quoted.  At the end of it all, I ended up paying more (about $48), and the hem on the gown was done sloppily and the material now has a permanent wave at the base of the dress (probably because if the thread and tension used). It is an expensive and fancy gown, so I was pretty bummed they did a sloppy job. The positive: the two ladies I worked with were nice and professional."
0,"I found this place when I purchased a deal chicken.  It was 5mins from my house and I was excited to try a new place.  I called to make the appt. and the girl was super nice and accommodating for my schedule.  I needed to get the gel mani and pedi done within an hour and a half.  She said no problem.  I was getting married that weekend and this was for the event.  I showed up on time and was told the original person I had the appt with wasn't there.  No problem I figured no biggie.  Boy was I wrong.  The lady who was my replacement was a hairdresser NOT a nail tech.  She had zero experience.  She was already doing someones hair and I ended up waiting 20mins before she started on my toes.  What a disaster.  She was slow and inexperienced and I think my 7yo son could have done a better job painting them.  By this time I was seriously running low on time so I just told her to do a reg mani and skip the gel (which was the whole point of me going in the first place!).  Not to mention they didn't have red in the gel which seems like a common enough color to have in stock.  I ended up going home and painting my own nails since I have a gel kit at home, thank goodness.  By the next day, I noticed that the toe polish was chipping and peeling off and was also goopy looking like the polish was old.  Very disappointing.  Needless to say I wasted my money.  Will NEVER come back here."
1,"I have been a patient of Arizona Family Care, with a primary care physician of Dr. Heidi Bannister, since - well, to be honest, I don't remember. Since before 2006 for sure. Dr. Bannister has always been friendly and attentive, with a caring demeanor. In fact when I changed jobs in early 2006 and found that my new insurance did not cover her, I was rather upset - and very happy when I found that my new employer's insurance (in 2007) covered her. \n\nTo put it another way: I live near the northern intersection of the I-17 and the 101. This office is Glendale, just off the 101 on Union Hills. It's easily a 15 minute drive to the office, and there are plenty of doctors nearer to where I live.\n\nYou may then question why I have given her office a two-star review.\n\nIn December I had an appointment with Dr. Bannister, as a follow-up for a head cold and eye problems that I was having. She asked that I schedule a follow-up appointment for a month out, so I stopped and scheduled one for mid-January.\n\nI received the reminder call the Friday before the appointment, and realized that I had forgotten to ask for the time off work, so I would not be able to make the visit. Fully intending to call, I wound up with a number of critical issues dumped on me toward the end of the day, and it slipped my mind. I did not think of it again until Monday morning, when I noticed the reminder card on my desk. By that time the appointment was well-past, so I decided I would simply go ahead and wait until the next time I needed to go in for refills or whatnot.\n\nA few days later I received a letter from the doctor's office. I figured it was a reminder that I had missed the appointment. To my surprise, I opened it to find a letter from the office, signed by the doctor, that they were dropping me as a patient. The reasoning?\n\nThree missed appointments - one in 2007, another last year, and then the one a few days ago (Jan 2012).\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I understand that missed appointments can lose an office money and cause issues for other patients. However:\n\n1. The doctor NEVER mentioned to me in any of the intervening appointments I had in 2011 and this last appointment that this was their policy, nor is it mentioned in any of their documentation (I just went to their website and double-checked).\n\n2. In every case that I had a missed appointment, I was charged a $25 missed appointment fee - in two of the cases, $5 more than my insurance co-pay (which I understand is only partial compensation since the visit is actually far more than that) that I paid.\n\n3. In one of those cases (the appointment in 2010) I actually DID call the office the evening before to cancel, but because of voice mail problems I was unable to leave a message. I paid the $25 missed fee anyway the next time I went in, because I liked the doctor's office and didn't want to make a fuss.\n\nFor whatever reason the impersonality of the letter bothered me. My first thought was to call the office but to be honest it's too much of a hassle; there was no diplomacy here, so if they do not want me as a customer, I do not want them.\n\nI would suggest to the office that they include this policy on their paperwork, and to call 48 hours before an appointment instead of the day before (when they require 24-hours' notice of cancellation).\n\nKeep this in mind the next time you visit the doctor; apparently the friendly relationship you perceive with your doctor only lasts until you've inconvenienced them a handful of times over the course of 5 years; then you're out the door."
0,"Wow. If you want to buy something here, be prepared to be assaulted if you don't want add-ons. I can't believe the change of attitude in our salesman when we said we didn't need cables, and did not want their warranty. The \""sales manager\"" came over, (who was younger than the salesperson--I'm not buying the \""manager\"" thing) and tried to sell us also. We left without buying anything. When they mention Monster Cable, RUN!"
2,"Went through the drive-thru today-- got my friends the cod sandwich. Several hours later, one friend had digestive problems. I've gone there before without incident, but i'd double check to make sure the food is cooked enough. Perhaps nuke it for a minute in the microwave at home to be safe."
0,Don't bother if you care about customer service. One stylist for the entire place resulted in two walkouts in 20 minutes. Amateur hour.
4,"I am a self proclaimed \""Trader Joe Hoe\"" lol. I don't care what anyone says, Trader Joes is the BEST grocery store EVER. The Arrowhead location is one of the best, I don't see why people are bitching about it. I shop at this location on a weekly basis and sure, sometimes it's a bit crowded but it's nothing unusual from Walmart, Fry's ect. I've been a Trader Joeaholic since my days in Los Angeles. The store locations are very limited in Phoenix, but I'm just so grateful they even have stores out here! Trader Joes carries so many foodie friendly products, no other grocery store can compare. A few of my top TJ products are..\nTrader Joes Meditteranian Hummus\nTrader Joes Dolmas (they even beat restaurant dolmas!!)\nTrader Joes Guacamole\nTrader Joes Dark Chocolate Covered Cranberries\nAnd the list can go on and on. Trader Joes carries a lot of vegetarian products as well which is pretty nice. And for everyone taking stars away from this remarkable place due to the fact that it's not near or in your darn backyard,  go take a hike to the nearest preservative packed Walmart and load up on pork grinds or something sheesh.. Trader Joes also has a raffle if you bring a reuseable bag when you shop. They always have had many lanes open when I go and the wait is never long enough for me to remember it being long. The cashiers are always really friendly. I love Trader Joes!! Always and forever!! 5 stars baby!! :)"
3,"Definitely one of my favorite grocery stores. Tons of vegetarian & vegan options. Lots of whole food based items. Lots of items focused on using healthy ingredients. They make lots of their own brand products, many of which are VERY good and delicious. We love their hummus.\n\nThe only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that I can't always find every single item that I need there, as Trader Joe's is a smaller grocery store than most. This applies to their produce section as well, as I can't find a certain vegetable or other item I'm looking for there occasionally. Wish the store was even bigger and offered even more so that I could do all of my shopping there."
3,"So now that I've been here multiple times, I must say that the rude worker was probably having an off day. Every time I've been in here everyone has been super helpful, it's always clean & everyone is friendly. LOVE TJ's!!"
2,"I have been here a total of three times, and each time I come I have tried something new hoping to find something that tasted good. Perhaps it is the fact that I haven't tried any good ones or perhaps its the fact that I have just been trying all the bad ones. Either or they are one in the same because every time I have come here I have been disappointed. Here is the break down of the stars given.\n\nStar 1:\nThe Service: I gave this a star because despite the drinks here being bland the people working here are absolutely not in the slightest. They have always been courteous and full of smiles. They are always prompt with making my drinks and very friendly.\n\nStar 2:\nThe Atmosphere: This place is a wonderful place to be whether you came to chat with your friends, study, or just read a book. There is no pressure to leave and there are many different types of seats in this place. A comfortable couch to read on, a sturdy chair to study in, or outside patio chairs for the cool evenings. \n\nStar 3:\nThe Location: Being next to the 101 freeway is always a plus due to easy travel. I can easily go from work to this place and then back home. All I have in my area is a dunkin doughnuts and to be honest you don't go their for lattes.\n\nOn the flip side, here are why the other two stars were not given.\n\n1: The drinks: As I mentioned before I was sorely disappointed with the drinks here. My first drink here was the Carmel latte and to be honest I thought I was going to get a blood clot because of how sweet it was. It was so sweet that I only could take a couple sips and then had to throw it away. My second drink was some type of ice tea. I love ice tea, but when I drank this it was so bitter I had to force myself to drink it all just to feel that I didn't waste my money. Finally, the last drink i got was the Chai Tea Latte. All I can say is that it tasted like a Chai Tea Latte that sat out in the sun for about 10 minutes and served. It was so watered down and unpleasant I just drank it as fast as I could and left it at that. \n\n2: The prices. When I look at the cost of some of these things I find myself a little in awe. How could such simple concoctions of sugar, power, coffee, and milk be so expensive? My chai tea was almost $5 with tax and it was tiny!\n\nDespite the disappointing drinks I think i keep coming back because of the atmosphere of the place. Hopefully I can find something to drink soon that is good, or I might have to start looking for another coffee shop. After all isn't the main reason you go to a coffee shop is to drink coffee or related drinks?"
3,"I love the furniture here! We went in looking for a coffee table and a large ottoman.  Pricey but all of the pieces are unique. Place was not busy and sales people did not circle you like road kill. They also didnt say hello, so I took a star. We were able to browse through and didnt have any questions so it didn't bother me that they didnt greet us. Large and small pieces to go in any room. Looked like they had a design center. Didn't find the perfect piece today."
2,The sushi rolls are kinda thin. I heard a lot of good things about this place. I only found it to be ok. I was not that impressed. I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice.
2,"For the price, Hungry Howie's is all right. I like the choice of crust flavors, and the coupon deals are reasonable. The Howie's bread is super salty, but otherwise it's the way I like it--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I ordered a pineapple pizza, and there wasn't much cheese. Otherwise, it tasted good. \n\nI would say this is a step above Little Cesar's."
0,No stars! Walk to the restroom and see the salsa and so called bean dip sitting on the counter with the dirty dishes and other cleaning equipment. I should have left then. Seriously on the cusp of calling the health dept on them.
3,"We love going to this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  The chips, margaritas and food are Deliciouso'"
0,"Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back."
0,"I'm not surprised by the reviews and wished I would have read them before going.  What I am surprised about is how many negative reviews there are going back several years and the same problems remain...hello?\n\nThis was our first and last visit.  There's no \""Steak House\"" apeal at all.  It more resembles a nursing home.  Not only the cliental but the decor as well.  Even when the phone rings, it seems to be amplified so everyone has an opportunity to hear it.  Management seemed very out of touch not only with the guests but the employees as well.  \n\nThe portions on the sides were very small and the 16 oz Ribeye I had ordered medium rare...half, yes half of the steak they praise was medium well and the other half was RARE, very very rare.  They forgot to bring out my mashed potatoes and once they did after I said something they were very dry.  Everything I had lacked flavor and care.  I could go on about the other 3 dishes my family had and didn't care for, however I really want to put this behind us. \n\nOnce a week my family and I try something new...we will not be back!"
2,"My first visit was decent, but didn't quite live up to my expectations.\n\nI food just wasn't that good for a steakhouse. Neither my wife and I cared for our appetizer. We got the Fire-Grilled Fresh Artichoke. They say it is a popular choice, but I didn't like it at all. My burger was very plain and lacked good taste. It made me wish I had gone to Five Guys instead. My wife got the steak and thought it was OK, but later she ended up getting sick. She ordered off the gluten-free menu as she has sensitivities, so this place may have issues with cross-contamination.\n\nOne positive was our friendly server. Cassie was excellent and we were very pleased because we rarely get good service when we go out. She kept up with refills and offered to replace anything we didn't like. I also wrote about my visit and explained how I didn't like the food. The manager said he would send us a coupon, so I can appreciate that they are reaching out to their customers.\n\nI got good vibes from sitting at the restaurant. I like their tables and seats. I think I will give it a second chance, but the food has to be better if they want to win me over as a customer."
2,"After being seated at three different tables we decided to sit at the bar.  We then found out they were out of lager.  How the hell can a brewery be out of lager?  The food was decent, the service was below average, and the crowd was the usual here in Glendale, old white folks."
1,"Eh. \n\nThey're open until 2am.  That's about the only above average thing they have going for them in NW Phoenix.  Probably the weakest Rock Bottom I've visited.  \n\nEverything is average or below average.  The prices are too high for what you get unless you hit happy hour.  With Yard House setting the bar in this genre, this place just looks weak.\n\nFood quality ranks at bar food to me.  Servers don't seem to be paid or managed well.  Upgrades are needed all around."
3,Huge selection of beers.. Ambiance is also great.. food is awesome....try the chicken nachos...just awesome !
3,"I really like shopping here.  The clearance racks have some great finds at decent prices.  It is the only section I would buy from (well other than the skin care counters) though, cuz prices are steep in my opinion everywhere else in the store."
0,"I work a Arrowhead in a smaller store so before work I decided to go shopping. I've been looking for a new watch and purse since I already got my taxes back. I went to the Michael Kors watch counter and the sales lady was helping some woman who said she was looking around, the woman was flashing hundred dollar bills in her hand, so I looked around. When that woman left, she completely ignored me and started doing paperwork even though I made eye contact with her and said hello. I'm only 18 and I look very young so I'm often passed by sales people because they don't think they'll get a sale.  well, I was going to give you a $300 dollar sale but I guess not now, people should stop judging by my age.\n\nAfter the stupid watch sales lady, I went to go look at some handbags. Where again, no one helped me even after I said hello and expressed interest. Step up your game, Dillard's. I, myself, am a sales associate and I know when someone is interested in making a purchase.\n\nThe atmosphere of this Dillard's is just crap now. I saw two beauty counter associates talking about an older Asian lady because she couldn't speak English and they couldn't understand her. They were laughing and ignoring her.\n\nThe amount of booger picking kids running a muck here is mind boggling. Watch your damn kids."
3,"It's a maze of toys that you won't find at most department stores. \n\nI like the organization. It makes it easy to go the the area you want. All toys in their proper spot, divided into Toddler toys, board games, stuffed animals, learning toys, dolls, sports toys, action figured, cars, etc. \n\nI was serious about the maze thing, lol. There is 1 entrance and 1 exit and they are not interchangeable :) When you first walk in, because they know children so well and their ability to walk in a door and then break out into an all out sprint in all directions, you are guided through a few isles that curve around (they are chalk full of toys, of course) and THEN you get to the main isle. \n\nMy check out experience was awesome. The lady actually noticed that I was hiding something my nieces view and she made sure to scan it when she wasn't looking and to double bag it :D I love her. \n\nPrices range, but the toys here do seem to be pricier in general compared to most department stores, but like it said, they have a much wider variety."
0,I would not go to them ever again. We have twin 18 month olds. they missed so many opportunities for candid pictures because they were so concerned with getting the one perfect picture. they also were way behind in appointments which made that window of opportunity with toddlers dwindle quickly because they under-staff and overbook. after an hour we were presented with 6 horrible shots. also their prices are insane. I highly recommend going to Pictureme studios instead. they are better priced and do an amazing job.
1,service is ok.\nfood is ok...actually really bland and plain. I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast.\nchamomile tea is the best.\n\ngood luck.
1,":( The service was fast. We ordered (2) meals. The Bouillabaisse seafood soup and the Bavette Steak with Brussels sprouts. The french onion soup was excellent. The soup was ok; it would have been nice to see some seafood in it for it was little. The Bavette Steak was awful. There were (5) strips of tough meat and the sprouts were burned; maybe they were trying cajun. Don't know, but it wasn't worth $17.50 :("
2,"Good, small portions. Pricey for simple foods. Nice environment."
0,"This Mimi's is the worst. The vibe is as if they are a restaurant in training. My server was nice but slightly flustered.\n\nI ordered the benedict with bacon and tomatoes. When you look at the picture on how it was served it was sloppy and made with no care. Mimi's has always given some presentation but this was food on a plate.\n\nIt looked a mess and then I put my fork in it had egg shells inside. I said to my family I knew this dish looked off when it arrived and now egg shells.\n\nI told my server and she was great about getting me something else and apologizing. So I ordered my next usual the Quiche Lorraine taste great but once again thrown on a plate. Typically its served on lettuce with fruit on a plate. This was not the case.\n\nLow Fat Blueberry muffin was great as always..\n\nThis location just didn't feel welcoming and the experience was subpar, management they need help."
0,"Have been to this Boston Market with Friend's on 5 Different Occasion's and everytime we go there. All of our Side Order's are alway's COLD.\n\nCold Mashed Potatoe's, Cold Stuffing, etc, etc. And they serve you very, very Small Piece's of Chicken for the Price that they charge you. \n-$7.50 with Tax.\n\nIt's not worth it.\n\nI have to admit the Food look's very seasoned and moist. \nBut it's ALWAY'S COLD.\n\nAnd they give you.....Small Piece's of Chicken. \n\nSorry Gang, Save Your Money and Go Somewhere Else. \nToo Expensive for Small Piece's of Chicken and COLD FOOD."
3,"oOoh been here once for dinner and about three times for lunch...it's really a great place for a quick and easy meal and it's not too fatty like other fast foods..and it's pretty cheap. \n\nI love their 3 piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread (I'm usually not fond of cornbread) and two choices of sides. I've had the creamed spinach, corn, veggie mix, squash mix, roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite....the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste...so not a big fan of that one..other than that the other sides are pretty good. The meatloaf meal is also really good...two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread...2 bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken. heh\n\nSo for a quick easy cheap semi-healthy meal that does not consist of a hand full of grease (burgers, pizza, tacos of that sort..) then Boston Market is really a fantastic choice =)\n\nYummers!"
0,Rude & uninformed staff.   Sales girl did not know what an insurance appraisal was.
2,"I had a lunch here not long ago, but it was nothing exciting. It wasn't even the best Old Country Buffet I have visited. The food was very basic and it was hard for me to find things that I really enjoyed. Because of that I decided to eat healthier options that I don't fix on my own, so I suppose that was good in a way. I would say its a good place to go if you are looking for home cooked type foods, but don't want to cook yourself. Just keep in mind that you won't find food that is overly tasty, if at all, here."
1,The food isn't all that great and the Mac n cheese taste like that cheap powder cheese and the staff act like they where scared to come serve us maybe because of our skin color. The place wasn't very impressive I won't be back. I tried it once that's it.
2,"It usually happens like this: I'm driving, on my way home. I call husband and ask what he wants for dinner. After several minutes of indecisive bantering back and forth, he says \""wings?\"" I say \""sure, from where?\"" He says \""Brothers?\"" I say \""sure, call it in.\"" Haven't had the pizza in quite a while, but it was alright. Obviously not fantastic, or I would remember that. And not disgusting, or I would remember that as well. They have a decent menu full of other Italian dishes and sandwiches. Not the best most awesome wings, but it's the closest and on my route home. Staff is friendly and the place is clean!"
0,"Place is a joke. Screwed up drive-thru order, food is disgusting, hard, dry. Wont answer phone. Calling MasterCard to do a chargeback."
4,They have good food. Been eating here since I moved down 10 years ago. I like their toasted subs and the pizza is excellant! My husband likes the wings and bread knots. Happy Hour is also a bonus.\n\n They are Phoenix Suns sponsors and host the Gorillla during the season. My kids loved eating thier gluten free pizza and meeting the famous Suns Gorilla! Very relaxed family friendly atmosphere. Always welocoming you with a smile when you enter.
1,"It has been about 6 years since we dined at streets of New York. This time we ordered a thin and crispy pizza, a Caesar salad and bread knots. From my memory the pizza was better than I remember but not great.   However, the salad was not edible in fact we took it back.  The romain was brown and at least 4 or five days past it's prime.   They took it back without any Question and comped us a piece cheesecake in good faith.  Who ever prepared our meal should be totally embarrassed....        I don't think we will go back.."
3,"This place gets a 4.5 Stars!\n\nI played on these fields twice for softball tournaments. One was for the ASA softball Worlds that they hosted and the other was most recently the ASA Hispanic Worlds Tournament. Both experiences have been great. Several well kept softball fields, sand volleyball courts, batting cages and bar/lounge area were one can have accessibility to watch the games. It seems to have ample parking lot, so I don't think parking will be a problem.\n\nI believe there is an entrance fee of $3.00 dollars. At Big League Dreams they charge $3.00 for entrance fee, but they give you a free drink token as well. I don't recall Victory Lane doing that.\n\nOverall great park and environment! A great sports venue!!!"
3,"This is a great complex that offers enough shade to keep you from getting too much sun, misters to keep you cool (if wanted to step in the direction of!) A bar/grill that isn't anything great BUT nice having the choice of having a little better selection of food other than game food; hotdog, pretzel, soda, ect..  I like the layout, I LOVE the future plan of a field for the disabled children (so so neat), and I liked the cleanliness of the bathrooms/complex.... MINUS the no clean at all bar area. Everything about being up on the deck/in the bar was very dirty. First off a dead baby bird on the deck (REALLY?! EWW) and the doors/everything you touch having horrible horrible amounts of dirty finger prints/sweat caked on. Yes, I understand it was a busy day for softball but a little touching up throughout the day...... Not hard."
3,"This Domino's is on point. I hate to admit it, but we order from these guys a lot and they are always quick, accurate and friendly. The first time we ordered from here when we first moved to Phoenix wasn't that great because they couldn't confirm our address was a house and we had to call to see where our food was. They eventually delivered it... cold. BUT I don't know if they have a new manager or not. They got there stuff together and I'm completely satisfied with them."
0,"Classic bait and switch. Called for an appointment  for a simple oil change with my own \""High End\"" Synthetic oil and K&N filter. Was quoted a certain price. Sent my wife in for appointment and the price jumped dramatically. Again... another case of a \""repair shop\"" taking advantage of a woman. Unfortunate because they are a neighborhood service dealer. \nDO NOT send a woman in by herself. In speaking with friends and neighbors, this seems to be a typical action by these people."
4,"One evening on the way back from Sedona I stopped here for some pie and a coffee.  It was about 50min before closing but followed a few other last minute \""pie-goers\"" in the door.  \n\nCute and cozy old western interior.  Cracker Barrel-esque, warm and inviting.  \n\nI spot on the menu RHUBARB CRUB PIE!!! I can't believe my eyes!!!!  My grandmother would always get rhubarb pie from a local farmers market.  I have been on a search for good rhubarb for a long time.  Let me tell you it was LOVE AT FIRST BITE!!!!  \n\nTheir pie crust is out of this world!!!  The crumb topping, TO DIE FOR!!!   \nI have had my fair share of pie and this TAKES THE CAKE!  \n\nHere is the pie list:\n\n-Apple \n-Apple Crumb\n-Banana Cream\n-Blackberry\n-Blueberry\n-Blueberry Crumb\n-Cherry\n-Cherry Crumb\n-Chocolate Cream\n-Coconut Cream\nJack Daniels Pecan \n-Lemon Meringue \n-Mixed Berry Crumb\n-Peach\n-Peach Crumb\n-Pecan\n-Pumpkin \n-Rhubarb \n-Rhubarb Crumb\n-Tennessee Lemon Pie\n\nThey have coolers filled with whole pies and slices to go.  Well worth the trip and you will be coming back for more!"
0,Stopped on the way to Payson.\n\nI was hoping for a good traditional down-home breakfast. What I got was denny's quality
2,"This is an odd duckling in the middle of basically nowhere. It was shockingly crowded and I think it must be very well-known by locals (their sign says \""World Famous Pies\""). We had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table around 2 on a Sunday but there's a store so we sort of wandered around and inhaled the aroma of fresh-baked pies while looking at cowboy kitsch. The poor hostess seems nice but she is woefully incompetent and got flustered easily when more than one person was waiting in line to get their name on the list. She had a heck of a time finding people, couldn't keep people straight on the list, etc., but was very nice.\n\nThat being said, I have to wonder about how this place seats people. The party behind us was a party of 5. They seated us at a table for 6 and there were only two of us but we came in before the party of 5 who was told they  might have to wait almost 45 minutes. Ok, that's fine. We were the youngest ones in the place by about 20 years which was a bit awkward. \n\nThe young man who brought us our water was very nice. The waitress was not and was very brusk, impatient and uninterested. The food was pretty decent for a roadside joint. My husband had the pulled pork reuben which was really good in the first half, but average in the second. I think only half the ingredients made it onto the second half of the sandwich. I had their chicken and biscuits which is basically a deconstructed pot pie and was very good. Awful for me, but really, really good. The biscuits were flaky and fresh-tasting. We split a piece of their Jack Daniel's Pecan Pie and you could definitely taste the whiskey. It was very good and the piece was perfect to share. Price was decent. \n\nSo food was pretty good but service was....lacking. It was a nice little stop overall on the way home from Sedona but I probably wouldn't stop again."
3,"They have great hours... open til 9 on the weekdays i believe, and I'm sure even later on the weekends. We were able to end our day with a drive out there, and made it just before close. They did have a diner where you could eat, but passed. Although it was very quaint, the reviews on food were mediocre. But, people were raving about the pies. They still had a great selection,tons of pies to choose from, even though it was the end of the day. We bought a whole pie, which are a little pricey, but well worth it, for the 2 of us to share. It did not last long! Plus a sticky bun, and another one piece of pie (which is nice when you cant choose) We were so disappointed at the thought of not being able to bring some home for our friends and family to try- so it will be a top recommendation to anyone we know going to visit the phoenix area. Although you could get them shipped, the shipping is astronomical, but at least will give us something to look forward to when on vacation in Arizona. The gift shop was also fun to look around in, lots of nicknack's and touristy souvenirs. Cant wait to visit again!"
0,"***My first review anywhere about anything***\nFor years, I've been hearing about these legendary pies...so, on a recent trip to the Grand Canyon, my wife and I made a point to finally stop @ Rock Springs Cafe for lunch.\nWe arrived well after the lunch rush, so there were plenty of seats available, and the restaurant appeared well-staffed.\nWe were seated quickly...I did my best to glance at the dishes in front of diners we passed along the way to see if anything looked particularly enticing...I noticed that several plates had uneaten, limp and soggy looking fries, so I made a mental note to avoid them.\n\n3 people offered to take our drink order within mere seconds...which I interpreted to be a sign of good things to come...but, boy, was I wrong. \n\nWe asked our server for recommendations, and she struggled to come up with suggestions.  The menu has a half-dozen or so items marked as \""House Specialties\"" (or something like that)...among them, is Chicken Fried Steak, which our server recommended as well...so I order that with mashed potatoes.\n\nOur Order:\nChili - My wife liked it\nClam Chowder - I'd bet $1000 it was from a can.  Artificially thick with scant (and very chewy) clams.\nChicken Fried Steak - Had an oddly uniform shape and thickness...I told the server that it was \""horrible\"" and asked if it was was prepared on site or frozen.  She admitted that they bought it already prepared and frozen and just heated it up.  She further stated that the previous owner had made it fresh, but that the new owners considered this \""good enough.\""  When I exclaimed that for $10.95 I could have bought the same garbage at Costco and made my own, she agreed.  I didn't finish the steak...and the gravy (like the chowder) was artificially weighty and almost certainly also from a can.\nMashed Potatoes - Not so much \""mashed\"" as \""smashed\"" and served with an ice cream scoop.  This may have been satisfactory, were it not for the grape-sized black chunk of rotten potato in my second bite.\n\nNobody ever noticed when our drinks needed to be refilled...I finally asked a different server for a refill.\n\nAt one point, I noticed that the pick up/service window was overflowing with plates ready to be served while waitstaff stood nearby, chatting, apparently oblivious to the food that was ready to be served.  (Well, at least \""intended\"" to be served...because most of what we saw was never \""ready\"").\n\nOur check arrived while we were eating our pie.  There was no consideration for the fact that we had complained about the food quality and not finished our plates.\n\nI don't remember what kind of pie we ordered...really...and, while I have no complaints about it, but it was certainly unspectacular.\n\n...then, we hit the road bound for Williams, AZ where we had an even less-stellar meal at the Grand Canyon Railroad Cafe...but, that's another story."
2,"My best friend and some our assorted kidlets ate here last night on our way back down from Flagstaff, where we were picking up the two oldest kidlets from NAU.\n\nWe pulled in at 8:40 and it looked almost deserted, there were only about 2 cars in the parking lot...  Being afraid they'd already closed, I checked the hours on the door; it said it was open to 10PM, perfect.  We walk in, seat ourselves (per the sign).  The wooden highchair we found for my toddler was missing the safety belts and was more wobbly than a 50 year old Bangladesh high-rise in a category 4 typhoon.  Seriously, I wasn't even sure it was totally safe, but we didn't see another option so I kept her at arm's length just in case it started to lean dangerously as she wiggled in it.  Thankfully it held up okay, but it doesn't have too many more days ahead of it before it's fire kindling...  \n\nRight away a hostess came over and offered us menus and takes our drink orders: 4 waters and a Dr. Pepper.  The waitress was there just a couple minutes later to get our dinner orders and unfortunately, one of the teenagers had just wandered away 30 seconds beforehand, so we had to ask her to come back in a second to get all of our orders.  Well, nearly 10 minutes later she returned and got all of our orders.   Also, while she was gone I noted that the floor was filthy.  Really, I'm cool with rustic concrete floors, but throughout the day someone needs to be sweeping the floor.  This floor didn't look like it had been swept ALL day long with crumpled napkins, bits of smashed food, straw wrappers, crumbs, etc.  \n\nI ordered the mac and cheese dinner entree, with vegetables in lieu of potato side and a side salad.  My side salad was served right away and was crisp and fresh.  Very tasty.  Interestingly, they serve it with diced cucumber and tomatoes, which was different, but very tasty.  I think I liked it better that way compared to how most places serve it.\n\nThe mac and cheese arrived a few minutes later and while it looked delicious with a perfectly browned bread crumb topping and gooey, stringy cheesey deliciousness, and perfect al dente macaroni noodles, it was totally and utterly tasteless.  I honestly think the kitchen made it without any seasoning at all.  Now, I'm no gourmand, but I've made some home style mac and cheese in my day and there are certain things (aside from salt and pepper) you can add to give it some zing, like onion, garlic, nutmeg, mustard powder, paprika, etc..  I don't think this mac and cheese even saw salt and pepper, let alone ANY of the more complex seasonings.  Sad.  I was really enticed, because it looked so good on the surface, but it was a utter taste-flop.  My 17 month old daughter wouldn't even eat it.  Additionally, the side dish they served it with was canned peas with a couple of random pieces of carrots.  Yuck.   Note to the kitchen: canned peas are virtually inedible gray-green little balls of mush; please at least use frozen peas, they are so much better tasting and looking and practically the same price.\n\nMy best friend said her Cobb Salad with grilled chicken was the best she ever had, and she knows from salads.\n\nThe other kids ate their food without complaint, except my 15 year old nephew, who also received a side of canned peas with his dinner.  He refused to touch them and made jokes threatening to throw them, one by one, at his older sister.  Ah, the joys of older children...  ;)\n\n\nAnyway, my friend and I shared a piece of Jack Daniels Pecan Pie.  That was superb.  And really, as most of us already know, pie is what Rock Springs Cafe is known for throughout the State, right??\n\nOur bill for 5 1/2 (2 adults, 3 teens and a baby) was about $66.  We paid it, and sadly we literally weren't quite to our car in the parking lot when they turned off the lights and closed the place down.  Weird.  It wasn't even 9:20 yet."
0,"Breakfast is all pre-cooked.  Ham boiled.  Ordered bacon well but it comes however it is cooked prior.  No special orders here.  Not that cheap either.  Just fast, that's all!"
0,"If you're in search of food, keep driving.  \nIf you're in search of pie, drive to the Pie Hole in Phoenix.  \n\nI used to go to Rock Springs Cafe on a monthly basis with my grandparents when I was younger.  That was our thing - taking a Sunday drive and stopping by RSC on our way back home to grab food and a piece of  \""Penny's Pies\"".   Penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in Black Canyon City.  I learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners, and oh my how things have changed.  From the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food.   \n\nKeep on drivin' if you're hungry and in this neck of the woods.  J, Baby C, and I stopped by Rock Springs to get an early supper on Sunday after a day trip up north.  I told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general.  He was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper.   \n\nJ ordered the meatloaf dinner and I ordered the chicken.  Our plan was to feed Baby C off of both our plates.  Good idea in theory.  When we ordered, I stated I wanted a baked potato (which was on the menu) and the gal said that they don't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm.  Ummm...Its Sunday and a holiday weekend.  If one was going to sell a baked potato, 4pm on a Sunday would be the right time.  No where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes weren't available until after 5pm.  \n\nJ gets the soup (chowder) and I get a side salad.  You really cant screw up either of those.  J said his soup was pretty good.  \n\nOur dinner comes out a few minutes later.  We were shocked to say the least.  We both dig in and J immediately is repulsed.  His meatloaf was lukewarm, greasy, and the gravy on top was congealed.  GAG.  My chicken was more like a Cornish game hen.  See photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg.  It looked more like a drumette, you know, the kind you'd get with an order of chicken wings.  The vegetables that came with out dinners, a half ear of waterlogged field corn.  An ear of corn (a bad ear at that) hardly constitutes as \""vegetables\"".  I was thinking we'd get green beans, peas, carrots, or something.  \n\nThe waitress came by and saw J was not pleased.  So she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else. I told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie.  If he was hungry, we could get him something at the outlets in Anthem (which was where we were stopping by on our way home).  J liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie.  \n\nWhen the pie came out, he took a few bites and that was it.  He said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold, but slightly warm.  I seriously doubt this was a true \""Penny's Pie\"".  More like a bad knockoff.    \n\nThe only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill, without us having to ask or talk to a manager.  \n\nWe stopped by the general store, but the guy there didn't seem interested in helping us.  Or at least helping me.  But yet he yacked it up with J for a minute.  When I walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing J, did he acknowledge me?  Nope.  So we left.\n\nAnd we wont be returning.  If we're out for a drive, and are in need of food...we'll drive to Anthem.  \n\nAnd - If you really want a GOOD (more like AWESOME) piece of homemade pie, go to The Pie Hole in Phoenix.  :)"
1,"We went out with the Central AZ Jeepers the other night to do a night run of the Maggie Mine Trail.  The plan was to start up at Bumble Bee, come south to Black Canyon City, then finish at Rock Springs Cafe for dinner and pie.\n\nFirst I have to mention we had a party of over 20 Jeeps and the trail is mostly visible from 17---we must have looked so cool, snaking along the mountain, our chair of headlights glowing in the night.  So if anyone took video...\n\nSo I was looking forward to Rock Springs Cafe.  We have driven past it a million times, but for one reason or another, never got the chance to stop in.  Finally!\n\nOur organizer, Cheri, had fixed it up with the Cafe that they were going to get invaded by 30-some Jeepers, so there was seating when we got there.  Parking, not so much.  They were having some sort of party at an outdoor venue down below---it looked fun.  Good music!\n\nWe were with DS and DSGF and they decided they were just going to hang out in the parking lot and listen to the music, because sometimes teenagers are weird.  But that put the kibbosh on a relaxing meal followed with pie, so I can't comment on the food.  But I insisted DH and I go in for some of that famous pie and coffee.\n\nIt took a bit to get some service, but we had walked in with thirty-odd people, so no dings for that.  The coffee was good!  Hot and fresh!  I ordered the coconut meringue pie and DH ordered the JD pecan pie.  My pie was a mile high, had a good coconut flavor but was a tad sweet for my taste.  But I don't like super-sweet stuff.  I tend to cut back on the required sugar when I make desserts.  But it was very good.  Someone commented in another review they thought the crust was store-bought.  Maybe.  DH liked his bite of my pie.\n\nI liked DH's pecan pie.  DH liked it, but he said mine is better.  (I make mine with chocolate chips and kahlua---go big or go home!)  \n\nIt took about 10 minutes to get our server's attention to get our check, which came to about $12 for two slices of pie and a cup of coffee.  She muttered something at us when she gave us the ticket---I didn't quite catch it.  So after about five minutes of sitting at the table waiting for her to come back, we took the ticket and cc and went to the gift shop to pay.  We stood there for several minutes waiting for someone and then a girl showed up and said: oh, no, you don't pay here, you have to pay your server.  (Oh, that must have been what the server was telling us!)  So we went back in to the counter and found our server.  She took our ticket and the cc, and then started messing around on the POS and I swear we stood there for ANOTHER seven or eight minutes while she entered some orders and helped another server with a question.  Then she took our money.  So, basically, we spent more time trying to pay our bill than eating our pie!  LOL!\n\nSo, it was an okay experience.  I'd probably go back if there was a group vote to do so, but I don't think DH and I would stop on our own volition.  I liked DH's pie better than mine and he liked mine better than his, but we both agreed that the cup of coffee we shared was very good.  Definitely, management could do a better job on customer service.  But you see a lot of this: management thinks they are \""saving money\"" by not having enough staff to take care of customers graciously and with efficiency, and then people stop coming because of the inadequate service.  Such is the way of the world!"
4,"Tennessee......Lemon Custard......Pie.......enough said. However I am sure there is a PIE choice you will find to your satisfaction as well at this SLICE of heaven in Rock Springs Arizona. Now for those of you not familiar with this location.....well you have truly missed out on one the WORLD's truly hidden gems when it comes to homemade PIES. There is a bar and cafe/restaurant along with a gift shop.....but the true prize here are the PIES. Now it can be quite a trek from the valley.....I live in the Paradise valley and it takes about 40 minutes to drive to Rock Springs. So with that being said I recommend only going if say your going to the Anthem Outlets on I-17 North or maybe heading up to Sedona.....Cottonwood.....Jerome....Clarksdale....Flagstaff area. You can't really miss it once you pass the Outlet mall however here is a very good tip just in case you do. It literally sits on the border between Maricopa County and Yavapai County.....if you pass the sign for Yavapai county and have not seen Rock Springs yet......you have probably gone to far.....just keep that in mind. Now go and get that PIE and remember to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!\n\nNOTE: Just wanted to provide an update on how to find this hidden gem.....again when you heading out of the valley going North on I-17......look for exit 242 as you pass the Anthem Outlets and you will be in PIE CENTRAL.....wohoooo!!!!!! Hope this helped ya!!!"
1,Only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great. Terrible service and don't have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting.
0,Today this cafe suck for customer service.. The wait staff is clueless on the customer experience. The food is okay but there better choices up the road.
1,The worst fries I've ever had! The best pulled pork Reuben. The banana cream pie needs bananas in it or else it is just a cream pie. The crust was non existent! Overall disappointed dining experience!
0,"Usually really good but today food was horrible.  I order carne asada nachos,  chips were full of oil, beans and carne asada tasted dry/old, hardly had a guacamole and sour cream and cheese didn't melt. Salsa was watered down had no flavor very disappointing."
0,"This place was straight up N.A.S.T.Y. \nI am prior military so I have eaten some not so good meals. I'm not a picky person. I think you can pretty much doctor up food to be edible....that was until today! I took one bite of my tostada and I refused to eat anymore. I literally was grossed out and by the time the staff noticed our table, I wasn't even willing to order something else. I was disappointed."
0,"Um...Wow!  I don't think they have maid service in this dive of a hotel.  After checking in, I opened the blinds.  Filthy windows with lips, nose and tongue marks from what looked like children who stayed their before me.  Room reeked of something nasty like urine, mold and mildew all mixed together.  Went to use the bathroom and it's a good thing I didn't sit.  The man who stayed there before me had peed all over the seat and nobody bothered to clean it before giving the room to someone new.  \n\nWent back to the lobby to get a new room.  At least the toilet was clean in this one.  But the sink had some dirty stains all over it from the last guest.  And their hairs were still in the shower which was apparently not cleaned.  All of the water cups in the room had holes in them and were unusable.  The bath towels were all different shades of stained dingy white covered in dirt and I had to borrow towels from the friends I was visiting.  Scared of the bed, so I slept with all of my clothes on.  Worst motel I have ever stayed in and definitely way over priced."
2,"Love's has everything you could possibly need on a road trip.  Cheap gas, tons of drink choices, a bunch of options for grub!  I knocked down the stars a bit for this particular location because the bathroom was not that clean compared to some spotless Love's bathrooms I have seen in the past."
0,Every time I go here there is always something wrong with my order always check your food before you leave I guarantee you will always be missing something or something ain't right.
2,"I really don't have much to say about this one, but if you are going to the movie theater that is located in the same center, it is a good place to grab a drink or a bite. I take my niece on our \""girls day out\"" movie trips here for lunch and she enjoys it. \n\nI usually have a grilled chicken salad and she always has a pizza, so I can't really say that I have tried what they are famous for.. since I don't eat pork, but the atmosphere is always high energy and the servers are usually pretty good and fast."
1,Its Chilis and you know what you are getting before you walk thru the door.  I like the chicken enchilada soup and ceasar salad.  I had to wait for my soup because they were making more and when I did get it...well it was so watery that I didnt eat it.  My salald was good.  Sat in the bar and the batender was friendly.
4,"Stopped here after visiting the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium. \n\nA friend and I were driving down Litchfield Road looking for some place to eat and I saw it out of the corner of my eye. My friend was like, \""Hey, why not....\"" and into the parking lot she turned. \n\nLike other people have said it's not the most spectacular looking place from the street...plopped at the end of a shopping center. I wasn't expecting much....but it kind of turned out like a Susan Boyle.....that whole judging a book by it's cover thing. \n\nService was prompt and attentive. It's a small place and it didn't seem too busy. We sat on the patio and I have to say that parking lot is the QUIETEST parking lot of any shopping center I've ever been in. Very relaxing. \n\nLike I said, I wasn't expecting much and wasn't sure what to order. I was torn between a few things and ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo. As soon as I ordered it I was like, \""Ugh...why did I order that?\"" It's just sometimes a restaurant will make a fettuccine alfredo that just leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth. Don't know if it's the cheese they use or what. So, like I said, I was dreading it. That whole Susan Boyle thing I alluded to earlier. \n\nStarted with some bread and a small salad with a creamy Italian dressing. Pretty good. \n\nThen out came my fettuccine alfredo. It looked good....and it smelled good. And I have to admit it was the BEST fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. Creamy, rich, and oh so good. I was SO happy I ordered it. \n\nWe ended with a creme carmel for dessert which was just right to top off our dinner. \n\nAfter dinner went inside to use the restroom and the restaurant was even smaller inside than I thought. \n\nChatted a bit with one of the employees about the restaurant and the owners. Very friendly and warm atmosphere. \n\nI don't get out that way much but if I'm around there again I will definitely stop in again. Thanks, Bella Luna, for surprising me with a great dinner. \n\nMoral of the review: Don't judge a book by it's cover....a singer by the way she looks....or a restaurant by it's location. Really. Don't."
1,"I've been here twice now and I'm not very impressed.  The service is slow and even when there is clearly no one else in the restaurant.  The food wasn't much better, it was ok, but a bit expensive for what you get."
0,"Went there for lunch . . . The food was average, had to ask for parmesan for the pasta, no salad dressing except Italian and just oil and no butter for the bread. The service was mediocre and the drink prices were just plain outrageous, even by PHX in-season standards. The cost of our 2 drinks was as much as our 2 lunch entrees. The atmosphere was that of a typical shopping mall restaurant. My 1st and last trip to this restaurant. It is overpriced and overrated."
3,"I went here on friday night because I was celebrating my graduation with my family. We had to wait like 45 minutes but, it was expected for a friday night. When we got seated, we got seated by a very nice hostess. She was polite and talkative. She seated us in a nice booth. We waited a little while before we were helped by our waitress but when she did help us she gave us what we wanted. She seemed very distracted and like she didn't give us all of her attention but its understandable she was busy so no worries. The food was excellent! better than I expected. I had the Terriyaki sirloin and it was a great! I loved it because it was sweet, and I was still able to taste the meat. I will come back again."
0,Came here for dinner after not visiting this restaurant for all most over a year and now I know why I haven't . They ran out of ribs so I order the 10oz steak and it taste burnt and it was very tough! I didn't even finish half the steak ! The happy hour specials are great but there dinner entires  are horrible ! Also the men's restroom was a mess trash over flowing with dirty paper towels and the floor was covered in urine ! Probably won't be visiting T.G.I Friday's anytime soon!
0,"The best part of the meal was our server, she was friendly and attentive.  The food was pathetic.  Ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese, about the size of a quarter on each.   My  friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good, but I was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and naked...Sat near the window, big mistake, it was so hot!"
1,"We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone."
0,"Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting. \n\nI do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get."
3,"Took the family out to this Macaroni Grill because we wanted to avoid the crazy wait at the Olive Garden in Surprise.\n\nWas able to get right in and be seated immediately which was nice.  Service was prompt, efficient, and attentive.\n\nThe server apologized upon bringing out my dish, (spaghetti and meatballs) because the kitchen did not put enough meatballs on my dish and she said there would be a slight delay in getting them and that they were comping my meal from the ticket.  Wow!  I was impressed, because I really would not have minded a wait, so it was a nice and professional gesture.\n\nAnyways, overall the food was good, portions were insanely huge and as I write this I have my leftovers to finish for lunch.   Overall, I think this location does a great job and has an interesting menu.  \n\nEnjoy!"
0,"I want to start off by saying that for the most part, I really enjoy Macaroni Grill. The problem is not with the Macaroni Grill, but simply with the service at this restaurant. My wife and I went this Macaroni Grill a few weeks ago and had a terrible experience. The waitress wasn't attentive. She kept forgetting about us. We left upset.\nI am a forgiving guy, so my wife and I tried again. We had a different server this time with the same result. The place was virtually empty, so I would expect that they would pay a little closer attention to us. I didn't happen. I had to flag down a waiter to get the check and get out of there. Very Poor Customer Service."
0,"We use to love this place....but we will never be back again after two consecutive trips of lousy service and food.  \n\nOne visit, I ordered pesto sauce with pasta.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, that was the only part done right.  The pesto had no flavor.  I was a watery green thin and oily sauce.  Didn't taste basil or nuts of any kind.  By far the worst pesto sauce I have ever had!   The portion was a joke too!  All the pasta on my dish could fit inside my baby's 8 oz bottle!  I'm not a big eater by any means, this was a perfect portion for me, but for the price there should had been at least double the amount of food!\n\nThey use to have a mango ice tea that was really good, but they did not have it the last couple of visits.  The bread is ok, but the entree doesn't come with soup or salad, something just doesn't seem right with that.  For the price they charge, dessert should be included!  \n\nMy children each ordered a kids meal, grilled chicken breast was very thinly sliced, about as thick as two quarters, so it was over cooked, burnt and bland.  Don't even bother with it!  Spaghetti and meat sauce was also bland!!  The kids size meal was the the same size as my meal, but half the price!\n\nMy boss treated us last week, again, poor poor experience.  Very consistent with the previous visit, but we were at the Bell Road location.  Portion was very small, I guess they want everyone to eat less pasta because its a fatten food.  They want you to really feel like you are in Europe!   Children's entree, chicken tenders,  was again over cooked and dry.   My shrimp pasta dish had 5 pieces of shrimp for $16.99!  Do I feel rip off!  \n\nGood Bye to Mac Grill, you are a Closed Chapter."
0,This place is very unorganized.  I will not be back.\n\nWe had to ask twice to get menus.  The pre-meal bread was cold.  Got the beverage near the end of the meal. They were out of the entree that my guest ordered. It took them 15 minutes to realize that and let us make another selection.\n\nThe sauce on the pasta I ordered was disgusting.  It tasted only slightly better than Chef Boyardee. \n\nAvoid this place and go to a better restaurant  ...
2,Decent food that you'd expect from a local restaurant that specializes in Mexican food. In short nothing to write home about...
2,"It's Cracker Barrel standard. Good food at a reasonable price. They know how to cook eggs TO ORDER (which can be something of a rarity). They don't come out over easy or over medium no matter how you actually order them and the ingredients are good for the price. The place gets busy...especially in the winter and fall, but no problem now. If you want a quality breakfast at a good price, stop on in."
0,"Never again.  The apple french toast (~$12) and the sampler (includes a little of the chicken dumpling, sugar crusted ham, and meatloaf - ~$14) and both were huge disappointments.  The only saving grace, for me, was the cranberry-pomegranate (or something similar) iced tea, which wasn't too sweet (yay!) and very refreshing (~$3).  \n\nOther important info: chain restaurant, country store and rocking chairs were fun, overwhelming menu, cleaning could be improved, and slow service."
3,"I love eating there breakfast here. Country boy is my fav. Love the steak and hash brown casserole. My order was almost perfect except i got wheat bread not white, i don't like wheat but no big deal. Mike my server was great, friendl, and nice"
4,"I have been to a few chircoprators over the years but never as good as Dr. Skabo!!!!! He takes his time to evaluate you and makes sures he's covering everything. He even takes his time to answer questions if you have any. He even helps out with nutrition!!! Dr. Skabo is super nice and very well educated in his job and takes great care of his patients. And Cecilia, receptionist/ office manager, she is the nicest person ever and has great customer service skills...she is so personal with every patient and knows them and treat everyone as if they were family (which I happen to love businesses that do this). Office is very clean and everyone there always looks professional. Highly recommend this office to anyone!!!!!!"
1,The staff was friendly and accommodating. I had an arrangement made for my grandma. After I left I looked at the flowers and some of the roses edges were dried/dead. I think the flower arrangement was over priced for what you what you got. :-(
1,"I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore."
3,Very good dive bar that can hold half the town.  Good spot and it is only blocks away which make it my spot to go for a drink.  I did go this Saturday  though and it was super super packed with college age kids and was just not my scene.  I will be back many times just don't think I'll go on the weekends unless I'm in the mood to be around a lot of people.
3,"Its one of the only country bars around on west side of town. Good live bands. Food is average. Some great swing dancers here on Friday and Saturdays. Strange thing is, the other room has hip-hop, so the mix of people is different to say the least. You have to see the Redneck Revolution. They play there often. Oh yea, cash only, they have an ATM inside."
4,"I dare you to find a better burger, chili or steak for the price. I love this place. It has a Grain Belt bar light. Need I say more?"
2,"Love this place!!\nWe were here on Monday sept. 15, 2014 and JJ was our bartender and she was the most accommodating and considerate person we had encountered since the beginning of our 3 day trip in Goodyear, Arizona. We came here today; Tuesday sept. 16, 2014 and our bartender was an arrogant, inconsiderate, slow, weak-pouring, rude, and unappreciative person. Had been tipping her at lease 20-50% on every tab. She thought she was comfortable enough to tell a person of our party(my girlfriend) to take the \""bitchy\"" look off of her face. JJ would have never done that.., she was still considerate and fun..which is what you need when you're out of town. \nAll in all, who ever this chick is she is \""BUTTHURT\"" about something and she shouldn't be taking it out on us. \nShe started getting busy and getting impatient... Hey girl, we're here and paying your bills...I'm typing this out at the table inside the establishment and she hasn't even been here to check on us. She IS NOT GOOD AT SERVING. Not bartending regardless. If we had JJ this whole time we would come back..as of right now I think we'll call ahead to make see who is working.."
0,"This is the GHETTO! Awful and lazy customer service!! I booked a reservation online and when I came in, I waited half of an hour to be greeted/helped, although there were only two people in line, on a Tuesday. Then the customer service rep told me they were out of cars, even though I had a prior reservation. She also rudely interrupted my friend (who was thankfully there for moral support). She then directed us to her manager, who also did nothing to help the situation. That girl needs to be fired. Not to mention that this branch has a dreary front office with almost no furniture and outdated 90's posters on the wall. Felt uncomfortable all around."
3,"Give me 4 slices of thick -sliced bacon, actually cook my eggs over medium like I ask and have butter coverage all over my toast, you get 4 stars! Really Simple... \n\n\nNah seriously, this is a good breakfast, solid contender. You can get Hash-browns or Home Fries. The Home Fries are always my first choice anywhere and here they get topped with this onion-pepper mixture after -cooking which I am not a big fan of though. So, I ask them to leave it off and then request the potatoes be cooked crisply- about half the time does it come out right, but that is OK, when it actually gets done it makes it a 5 star awesome breakfast! \n\nTook my brother and his family to breakfast and they really liked it. My brother got a 'Joe Bear Scramble' which he liked and was plated so appealingly, the lady at the table next to us saw his and ordered this for herself. SIL got the HUGE Chicken Fried Steak and really liked it, she is finicky so this is good. 7YO Nephew got the Cinnamon Roll French Toast (4 pcs) which he liked. But, we had to order him a side of bacon because it does not come with any meat. Hard to justify $10 plus breakfast for a 7year old but oh well, I stole a bacon leaving him 3 pieces which he gobbled up! Suggestion, half the order and add bacon as another option, the pieces are large enough to make this a solid plate for women or kids. \n\nThe interior is on old Denny's and needs to be refreshed soon and parking can get tricky after 9:30am on a Sunday. \n\nSo, if you are in town for NASCAR or Spring Training at Goodyear Ballpark, this location is right off I-10 (Southwest side). Go here or to Mimi's (Northwest side)) for breakfast, but please, stay in Goodyear and keep businesses thriving so I have a job. Thanks :) \n\nTo get 5 stars I would say ramp up the home fries a bit, they are missing something but I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe use fresh onion without the bell-peppers (their \""mix\"" seems to be pre-made frozen prepped kind) and cook with the potatoes to caramelize versus heaping them on after in a wet mess? Dunno, but probably. \n\nEnjoy!"
2,"Our waitress was a grouchy bitch, and there was no fresh OJ, but other than that it was OK.  Loved the sign at the register that read \""No Open Carry\"" of weapons.  Hahaha!  I was concealing, anyway..."
0,"Meh. I have to say I've had way better, I've seen worse. This hotel was a cheap late night find off of I-10 as we traveled from California to Texas. The staff was pleasant enough, the building/rooms old but looked to be recently remodled. I do not really like hotels that are open to the outside, meaning the entry doors face out into the elements. (I prefer the entry to rooms enclosed within secured buildings.) So this made me nervous because the areas away from the lobby are not wel lit and dark. The room looked clean but very tired in my opinion with dark, worn carpet; yellowed, dirty switch plates and typical economy hotel dressings. The bathroom was freshly updated with tile, new coats of paint (in main room too), and new fixtures. But, the bathroom was not spacious at all and left a claustorphobic feeling. The clothes closet was more of a nook with a rod which was a first for me to see in a hotel... Kind of corny and cheap. The water though was nice and hot and the tub sparkly clean. The beds were firm but comfortable enough to sleep on and had stacks if feather pillows - NOT my favorite options from hotels though for sanitary reasons. The room had standard furniture with a nice HD LCDtv. The microwave was great but the fridge not very cold. The a/c was odd to control and did not want to stay on at the temp I selected (colder) but fortunately it was a cool night and we were cool enough to sleep. This room was not \""horrible\"" but I just couldn't get past a dirty vibe and I personally was not at ease with the room. Like, I cringed at the idea of walking barefoot across the carpet- even though I am sure the carpet was vaccumed (too dark to tell). And, I wondered if I might wake up to bedbugs. (Envoked paranoia) So that said, the hotel is probably what you would expect from a cheaper economy standpoint but I definitely DEFINITELY would not opt to stay at this place again."
1,"Don't come to the Best Western Plus Phoenix Goodyear Inn expecting the Ritz-Carlton at Dove Mountain. \n\nDude and I booked through Expedia to stay here for one reason and one reason only: Avoid a DUI.  \n\nWe went to Oktoberfest with some of my colleagues at the Airline Training Center of Arizona (Lufthansa) and German Air Force Base across the street. \n\nI've stayed at Best Westerns in the past, and have had good experiences. \n\nThe price was fairly reasonable - and again, we were NOT expecting luxury - However, the crap smells emitting from bathtub drain throughout the room were competely unacceptable. \n\nDidn't even bother with a shower, but it was still gross. \n\nThe room also wreaked of cigarette smoke. \n\nNot my first choice for DUI avoidance in the future; we'll find another cheap hotel if we go party with our German buddies next year."
0,"I've eaten at quite a few waffle houses in my day, so I know not to expect much. They're usually pretty good and this one was about the same. BUT I was VERY disappointed at the service at this place. It took almost 5 minutes just for someone to get our drink order(the place was not busy) and the table was still dirty from the previous customers. I saw 2 employees on their cell phones while cooking food. Another employee was actually walking around talking on her cellphone while working. But the one thing that got me, was seeing 3 employees drinking beverages around the food. One server kept her coffee cup on the tray that held the syrup(which was right by our table). Another server had his on the counter near the stove. And another had hers near the coffee machines and I saw them quite frequently drinking from them. I know this isn't the grandest place the eat, but I was expecting a bit more than how I saw the employees behaving..."
0,"The absolute WORST nail salon I have ever walked into. I didn't even get my nails done. I walked out because I was so disgusted by their lack of customer service. \n\nI went here because they have children's pedi chairs. I take my 3 year old there after a long day at work because I promised her a mommy day. I walk in and explain she doesn't really need a pedi just her nails painted. He tells me $5 and as my daughter runs over to the kid chairs (which no one was using or waiting for) stops her and tells her she can't sit in a chair unless she gets an actual pedicure. My daughter bursts into tears and he tells her \""too bad\"" ASSHOLE!\n\nI walked out and went across the street to Angel Touch Nails. They gladly accommodated me and my daughter and let her sit in a chair\nEven tho they don't have the kid ones. \n\nPeople take their hard earned money places to have experiences! It's not just about\nThe money people. This business should be ashamed!"
2,"I went in there because I really needed a hair cut for school pictures the next day. The girl that checked me in didn't know how to work the computer, or the credit card machine. When I mentioned a defuser for my bleached blonde she was confused about what I was talking about!!! When she cut my long blonde hair she wet it down and then took half an inch off and re-layered it. I paid and left with it wet which was odd to me. I went grocery shopping and when I got home it was dry and my hair looked like a hack job! It was not blended and it looked like a kid at cut it. It wasn't even and you could see the obvious layers and cutting lines!!! I was pissed. I went back in to get it fixed the next day and thank God Rachel was there and she styled and fixed it. She had to take off another half inch of my hair so that it would blend, that's how bad it was cut the night before by the other girl. It took her over an hour to fix it. While I was there I watched a lady with purple hair cut three other people's hair, she washed their hair and cut it wet and didn't even dry it!! I'm sure their hair didn't turn out! Rachel gave me a business card and her number and she is the only one I will let touch my hair. I plan on going back to have her touch up my ombr\u00e9 soon as well. \nLadies with long thick hair beware!!! Rachel seems like the only girl who knows what she is doing!"
4,"Jerry with Time Saver is a true professional. Honest, relaiable and has the experience most people only dream about. \n\nYou will not be sorry you called Time Saver for your plumbing needs."
1,"My son has OT in the same parking lot, so I have come to this place a few times for lunch. First thing that turned me off was a huge tip jar they have in your face when you order. They have a sign saying that they prefer cash, and that 'credit card and debit card fees break small businesses'. Huh? The first thing I ate here was shrimp fajitas, which with drink was about $15. Very small portions and not worth it. Chips are ok, but the salsa and picante sauce are in squirt bottles...and cold as heck. If you want any kind of side, it costs a dollar or more. I got a burrito the next time I came here (it was good, the Healthy Bean one) and it is 5.50, but if you want sour cream, guacamole, and chicken (they try to press it on you) that will be another nearly 5 bucks. It's good but not very big. Drinks are in small styrofoam cups and cost 2 bucks. They have a sign saying NO OUTSIDE DRINKS. I can see why, they have a racket going here on their overpriced drinks. The straw that broke the camel's back is that I waited in line behind two people who couldn't make up their mind for twenty minutes, and the woman behind the counter tried to help the woman BEHIND me first. WTF? Not great service, food is ok with skimpy portions, cheapo atmosphere, TIP JAR in your face...skip this place."
4,Awesome place all around!
3,Spent two nights here for a family event.  Since I love older resorts and historical sites this type of hotel was a perfect choice. Check in was quick and getting a roll away bed was no problem. The grounds are well kept and the style Territorial or SW is so charming.  The pool we visited was the kid-friendly one that has two waterslides.  The ONLY exception to the stellar customer service however occurred at the pool. Our server was a very young (16?) girl who took our drink order and disappeared for 25 minutes. Keep in mind that it is at this point 103 degrees in the shade. And she didn't seem to be busy at all as we could see her from where we were sitting.  My husband noted that many hotels and resorts now include a 20 percent gratuity automatically and that it was unfortunate because servers aren't incentivized to provide a good customer experience.   Finally he got up and walked over to the bar and simply asked the bartender for his drink. The young girl seemed to disappear as he walked up. A few minutes later my husband had his  drink and returned to our spot at the pool when a more mature server (Christine maybe?) greeted us and apologized for her coworkers lack of service. She was from Chicago as is my husband and they chatted for a moment. Later we confirmed that the 20 gratuity was not included but that younger server was probably not well-suited for her job.
4,"This is my favorite local Mexican place - great chips and pico de gallo along with good fresh food.  At lunch I like the #1 combo- taco, enchilada, rice and beans.  I don't order bean very many places-- these are so good that I will order them as a dip for my chips!  Friends like chimis and tilapia too."
3,"Great food & fun atmosphere!\nIt is one of those low-key place you look for when trying to find something unique. I have had fun everytime I've been there. Plus its a great place to learn a little about the history of Litchfield Park and how far it has come. Its a perfect dinner venue on the 4th of July for the fireworks displays from Goodyear & Litchfield Park.\nmmmmm, ready for lunch right now, right now!!!"
2,"We visited there on a Friday night....sometimes the best time to see a restaurants potential is when the placed is packed.  Out waitress was friendly, informative and seemed eager to assist.  Good, I like being taken care of.  There were just two of us so we sat at a small 2-top near the front door. Seating was minimal inside...had the weather been warmer, we would have loved to sit outside but bit the case that evening.  Chips and Salsa were brought out immediately and were quite flavorful.  The Salsa is mild but there were two other variations which would melt plastic  so be wary.  I love it HOT but not everyone can handle it.  We ordered two Margarita's on the rock, the house blend, nothing special and they were nice, just what the DR. ordered.  My dining companion had a child's-plate of Cheese Enchilada, rice and beans.  I ordered the Spanish Flag Enchilada's, one chicken, one beef and the other spinach.  The food came quickly and was piping hot!  The beans were good but the Spanish Rice was institutional at best.  Mixing the two together was the way to make them palatable.  The Cheese Enchilada was tasty as were my three.  The Chicken was shredded, as was the Beef and the Spinach very creamy.   We chose not to try dessert this time and the check came quickly.  Not a bad night out but very simple dinner at best.  I think the service trumps the quality of the food more than anything.  A few good Margarita's will take care of that any time!  For a quick and easy meal that's affordable, it worked well for me."
2,Wow all the other Yelpers were right on with this one.  The chips and salsa are amazing.  The atmosphere is very cool with the outside misters and big screen TV's to watch the game.  However the food was so-so.  If I were to go back it would be great for appetizers and beer to watch a game.
1,"The second time I went here, it was absolutely horrible.  I ordered a vegetarian dish.  It came out stone cold.  I sent it back and it came out a second time, covered in cheese and when I dug in, I found meat.  They didn't even care!  I sent a letter to the owners and NEVER got a response.  This place is a disgusting excuse for a restaurant.  BEWARE!"
0,"Service & food sucked. Walked in with a group of 13 people and was told by the bus boy to seat ourselves. After literally 10 minutes, we were finally able to sit down after my family members rearranged different tables around to accommodate. Not once during this whole time did the servers offer to help; instead, they walked around us pretending to be busy (the restaurant was almost completely empty). I made the mistake of ordering fish tacos in Arizona... The tilapia was disgustingly FISHY and no amount of squeezed lemon was able to save it. I also had to ask for more corn tortillas from the kitchen because the original ones that came wrapped around it were completely soaked through from the rice and beans (to the point where I couldn't even pick them up--they all fell apart). Margaritas were ok, as were the salsa, chips & quesadilla that we had as apps. Came here last year (when we again stayed at the Wig Wam Resort across the street) and forgot about how less than mediocre this place was.  If it wasn't for my FIL not wanting to drive, we definitely wouldn't come back here. Now we know. Blegh."
3,"I stopped here for lunch while visiting friends over the weekend.  I've been here many times years ago when I lived in Goodyear Az and always had a good experience but this time was only mediocre.\n\nThe art and food festival was going on down old litchfield road which brought out a ton of people.  Surprisingly, there was an open table on the patio though and we didn't have to wait at all.  The place was very crowded though and it took almost an hour and a half to get our food after we ordered.  I got the enchiladas suizas which are usually very good but this time mine were only luke warm at best.  No one else at the table complained.  The chips and salsa were good as well, they bring out two types (a spicy one and a milder chunky one).\n\nOverall, this is a decent mexican restaurant (probably the best one in Goodyear).  They have good food and it is in a nice scenic part of town tucked away in old litchfield park.  They also have a full bar but I think their margaritas are a little too sweet."
2,"After choosing our table and having it cleaned, the same young waitress returned with chips, salsa and menus. I asked the waitress for a Coke to which she replied \""I'm not your server\"". After waiting a little while our designated server appeared and took our order. Our designated server delivered our first round of drinks and our food. The rest of the time we were constantly asked by the first waitress if we needed anything, including refilling our drinks. I think we were in a server parallel universe.\nBTW - the food was okay.\nBeware of the umbrellas at the tables. They have seen better days. After almost being beaned by one I spent the rest of the meal holding on to it so it wouldn't fall on me again."
1,"The people that work here have been so helpful and honest in accommodating me with my pool questions and needs - with one exception.  There is a young woman that works here that is the most rude and disrespectful person I've ever dealt with as a customer at a commercial establishment.  She mumbles and talks extremely fast and when you ask for clarification, she rolls her eyes, sighs and acts out as if she's being bothered. I've had to deal with her 3x now and her attitude is horrible.  Seek out anyone at the store except for this gal with blue hair and gobs of eyeliner because she is absolutely awful and mean.  I won't go back here as long as I have to deal with her."
1,"When we have been in the store, gotten water tested and purchased product, all was good.  We like that the business is locally owned, so we contracted them to come blow out our lines as our suction was depleted on the side inlet of the pool. The gentleman came out to our house, looked out our pump and set the handle and said that the pool lines didn't need blown out, it was just that our pump was too small. That was last August and we continued to have issues with the pool's side inlet so we called them back to see if they could take another look. The representative told my husband that it would be another $85 to have them come out. Considering that they kept our entire $85 from last time and did not do the job, we declined. We then went to Home Depot, purchased items that would allow us to clean our own lines. Surprise, surprise, there was a Hot Wheels car in the side inlet that was blocking our lines. We knew there was something in there and we were right. \n\nThe store is fine, the products are well priced, but their customer service when it comes to the service we bought for them to blow out our lines was unacceptable.\n\nWe won't be back. Leslie's is closer anyway."
0,*  Very dirty dinning area!!\n*  Employees obviously do not care about customer service \n*  McDonalds should pull their affiliation - very bad representation of the brand
2,"I have to say it appears my idea of a great zoo differs greatly from my fellow yelpers.\n\nThis zoo does have some great features.  Fantastic variety of animals from all over the world.  And if you like tigers, this is the zoo for you.  The animals appear well-cared for and the grounds are reasonably clean.\n\nHowever, it escapes me how this zoo can warrant a five-star rating given the number of \""exhibits\"" that are merely large cages sitting side-by-side like little hotel rooms.  Don't get me wrong, some of the exhibits are great and well-designed.  But many others are terrible and seem to offer little to the animals except shelter.  Perhaps this zoo houses more animals than it can adequately support.\n\nFor $18 a ticket, I expect more.\nI"
3,"Another nice zoo offering in Arizona, with the addition of an aquarium. (I find it odd there isn't an aquarium in downtown Phoenix though.) \n\nAnyway, we started on the zoo side and saw many cool animals who seemed to spend most of the day lounging around or playing with habitat mates. They have many birds, reptiles, and even a baby animal nursery. Animals are diverse and worth spending the first half of your day with before you head over to the aquarium. Be sure to check out the albino wallaby! (Interesting to see an albino in the always constant Arizona sun.) \n\nIf you are feeling adventurous, head over to the hands on exhibits where you can run your hands along the back of a stingray, or pick up starfish. \n\nAll in all, a great zoo/aquarium and though it's a little more expensive, it's worth the money. Use your entertainment book for the valuable two for one coupon!"
4,"We loved it, our one year old loved it, my parents loved it.\n\nThe outside was surprisingly new looking and inviting. The entrance fee was inexpensive and once we got inside we figured out why. There are a few rides, but you have to pay extra for them. Since we had our baby with us, most rides were not for us, so we were glad we didn't have to pay for them.\n\nThe diversity of animals is amazing, including the aquariums.\n\nMust go and tell your friends. We've been in Phoenix for 10 years and its our first time. We need to spread the word so it won't be a secret any longer!"
2,"We went to the Wildlife World Zoo to check out the aquarium and see what kind of reptiles they had. It's only a few minutes from where we live and we love to go to different zoos. The biggest problem with this zoo is the ridiculous entrance fee. Make sure to get a discount coupon if you're going to go (they have them in the West Valley View newspaper from time to time.)\nThe zoo itself is pretty cool. There is a large amount of birds of many different species as well as the normal large cats and Savannah ungulates. Of course our favorite part was the reptile house, including a giant Galapagos Tortoise along with many other snakes and lizards. There is also a place where children can interact with sulcata tortoises. \nThe aquarium is pretty nice. Its not the best I've ever been to, but also not the worst. The problem, as I already stated, is that it is the most expensive zoo I've ever been to."
4,"Great place, if you live in the area and plan to go alot,a.season pass is a good investment, considering a one time ticket is like $28.00. A all year pass for an adult is $100.00 and for kids $50.00. We love going there! the god is expensive so I always pack snacks and water. (they say ur not supossed to) but I always have! Bring change to feed the giraffes ,koi, ducks, and fish!"
3,"I went here yesterday and ate at Dillion's BBQ, I had a tiny issue with my food and they fixed it instantly and it was perfect. The manager was great with me, and I will defiantly be back"
3,"Rode over on our Harley with some friends. We enjoyed a great tasting lunch and a couple brews. Seems be out in the middle of no where... but we like these kind of places. Bet the place is jumping on the weekends, have to make it back some Saturday evening."
3,"We stopped here on tour one time.  And then one time again on the way back.  Had a nice meal, some beers, some shots, hung out for a bit.  Everyone working there was really friendly.  If I'm ever headed through again I'd definitely stop in."
4,"I have been going to the El Dorado Hot Springs for years and always have a relaxing time. Open your minds and give it a try...you won't be sorry\nMakes for a great \""day trip\""....lets relax"
2,Staff here is usually very nice and helpful and not overbearing. Everything is kept nice and tidy. I just feel that this location does lack in variety and sizes...
1,Not a stellar location for Applebee's.  I am trying to forget the whole Ricky-Bobby thing and just be subjective.  What really loses me here is the menu.  Seriously high sodium fatty foods that always taste less than fresh.  I have to pass on these guys in the future.  \n\nThere is no compelling reason to eat here.  Lots of other good options in the area.\n\nThe Reuben is a salty mess.
1,"I've came here a couple of times. Nothing special here, just another big name franchise. You can tell they try to cater the younger customers. Never been a big fan of this franchise, but will come back to try something new or meet up with someone? Food is usually salty and not much flavor. There is a lot of other options out there for you to try instead."
0,"They refused to put air in my tires that were purchased there, they tried some scare tactic that tires would explode or some BS, this is a Cadillac that is only driven to the grocery store by my 86 y/o Mother. \nI took it to Fletchers, no problem.  I will never use Discount Tires again. Beware!!"
3,"HH is the kind of place you go to when you're low on cash, it's Monday night & you are willing to drive to pick up your food.  They used to offer a medium 1-topping pizza for $5.55 on Monday nights.  Last wk when I called to order the special, they said it changed to a large for $5.99.  The beauty of this offer is that you don't have to buy 3 pizzas to get that price like the other chains!!!!!  With the economy in the toilet, I was astounded that they increased the size thereby improving the value for my hard earned dollars.  \n\nAs for taste & quality--it's pretty good.  I like to order the thin crust and usually get sausage or pepperoni anything extra, I add on myself (e.g., red onion, black olives, etc).  They don't glop on the sauce or skimp on the cheese & I've never rec'd a burnt/nearly burnt pizza.  It's even pretty good reheated."
4,"Every time my sister and I come here we get exceptional service! The manager is awesome, the staff is so helpful, if they don't know the answer to something they will go above and beyond to make sure they find it for you!! We went to another Kohl's and it just reassured us to always come back to this one!!!"
1,"Every time I go here I regret it. The food is not very good obviously, but it is super cheap. Typically I'd prefer taco bell, but the taco bell on Waddell and Litchfield always sucks, so if I'm in the mood for bad,cheap fast food tacos I go here."
2,"While I am a fan of the chain itself, this location and I haven't quite seen eye to eye on some things. \nFor example, what is 'new' and what is 'used/floor model'. \nIn my opinion if something is out of the box, full of dust and glitter and has possibly been tested by customers, it's used and you should give at least 10% off if you don't have a new one to sell. \nTheir opinion; if it's not broken it's new, even if no box exists any longer and it has to be beaten and cleaned...... \nAlso, their computer search skills leave something wanting. I was looking for 3 items, they had only 1 and after doing a computer search told me that no store had 3. \nWhen I looked it up myself I found that a store very close by had 4. I called them, they reserved 3 for me and I picked them up that day. \nMoving on! lol\nThe staff is pleasant enough, the location is small but chalk full of great stuff :)"
2,"Overall each of my experiences at this particular Red Lobster have been okay. \nThe restaurant itself is clean. The bathrooms are kept up. \nThe service can be dicey. We went two times recently very close to each other. \n\nThe first time the service was pretty bad. I kept asking for our free cheddar biscuits and our waiter kept telling us they were making more and he would bring some out as soon as he could, despite the fact that other tables around us were receiving them. I finally stopped a manager and asked for them and we received the biscuits right away. I don't know if it was the waiters ploy to get us to order more items we would pay for but it was not successful. What he did succeed in doing was lowering his tip. Foolish waiter, he did not know I waited tables for 10 years and always way over tip for even adequate service. At any rate the rest of the meal was fine. I almost always enjoy the food there. \n\nThe second time we went we had excellent service. Our waitress was prompt with both the yummy biscuits and drink refills. I did, however have a complaint with the food. We ordered the potato battered shrimp and never have I eaten anything so salty in my entire life. My husband & I each took one bite and had to send them back, requesting something else instead. The waitress handled this beautifully, it was the manager, in this case, that didn't. The manager didn't even do a table visit. I also was in restaurant management for 15 years and I know the first thing you do when you have a customer complaint is GO VISIT THE TABLE! Instead we could see her rolling her eyes when the server brought this to her attention. She made the server come back to the table and collect the shrimps in question. The server did replace our shrimps with something else we did like and did so quickly. The rest of the meal was fine. \n\nSo yeah, overall it was fine. A couple of problems each time but always resolved quickly except for the lack of concern on the part of the manager. A good place to go and get some yummy food."
0,"Horrible! We waited in the lobby full of people for over 20 mins for a table. Normally I don't mind waiting but when I look and see servers shooting the breeze and half the restaurant empty well then it becomes an issue. Finally got a table, the food was horrible and then the bill came. What a rip-off!!! Stay clear of this place!"
0,terrible conditions in prime time of year. mickey mouse layout. skip it.
3,"A great place to let the kids blow off steam on days with severe heat advisories! \n\nBetter pizza, games & prices than a place I will only refer to as Chucks :D\nGranted, the space is smaller & 90% of the tables are reserved for parties (seriously, there should be a limit on how many tables can be reserved!). If you just want to let the kids run around for a bit and eat some pizza without a party reservation, you'll want to send a scout ahead of you to find and hold a table.... not even kidding. \nThe quality of the pizza is not what it would be at other pizza establishments geared towards adult taste buds, but this place IS geared more at entertaining your kids than it is at providing gourmet pizza. As long as the kids are happy, safe & entertained, I'll eat what they give me happily, lol! \n\nThere is no mascot in costume OR 'show', but they have games for all ages, not just toddlers, so that's a plus! There are also 3 televisions set up in the dinning area & they are normally set to sports."
4,I have been coming here for years. Best bakery on the west side. Huge variety. I just can't decide what I want when I'm there since everything looks so delectable and fresh.
2,"Just recently stopped off on my way home from work, called mama if she wanted anything for lunch? So she thought be a good idea to get Wendy's.\nI ordered Three cheeseburgers, order of chicken nuggets, and two large fries. I had the nuggets, it was ok. Not great? I would rather have them at chick fl'a instead. Girls had no problem mowing down the burgers, including the wife. Fries were actually good, forgot to tell them no salt. But it wasn't that much salt anyways. \nI like how the location use to be a bank, neat how the reconfigured it to make it work. Even though we have tried to stay away from fast foods, Wendy's was a nice change."
2,"Pleasant service and a good selection of cacti are available here.  I greatly appreciated all of the extra information on care for my new cacti, and helping me to avoid a few varieties that would require more effort than I was willing to provide.  Both premium examples as well as a few discount ones were available, depending on one's needs.  Free delivery and planting with $500 purchase.  I'm going to truly enjoy my new Saguaro and barrel cacti."
4,Absolutely the best customer service ever!!  They always have the best rates and great vehicles.  I would recommend them over and over again!
4,"Seriously surprised at the overall low-ish rating for this joint.\n\n Let me start by saying I am pregnant.  I am picky, hungry, and have something to say about just about everything (poor husband).\n\nHub and I decided at the very last second to try this place instead of KFC.  More options.  3PM on a Sunday is totally dead, and there is one server for the entire place, but seemingly handled well.  We chose to order our food to go.  \n12 Piece White Meat Broaster Chicken family meal\nMake your own 14\"" PIzza with chicken, spinach, and provolone. Half Cheese\n\nTook about 35 minutes for everything to come out, by then I was falling apart being so hungry.  One look at the pizza and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it looked.  Eyes of pregnancy can be deceiving...however, not this time!!  Every bite of all this food was way more delicious than I was anticipating.  The broaster chicken is done to perfection; juicy, crispy, hot.  The pizza was nicely browned on top, with plenty of the toppings we requested.  Taste was phenom.\n\nI literally just finished eating and had to rave about how good this was.  Husband and I were equally impressed, and will return to try more goodies.  \n\nNot sure on service...girl taking orders was pleasant and got everything right."
1,"We've been here twice. Food is decent, but the service is horrible. From the time we sat down it took us about ten minutes to get WATER. After we ordered, it took 30 minutes for our SALAD to arrive. Yes, lettuce in a bowl took 30 minutes. Both times it was not busy, half full dinning room or less. If you have all day and you aren't very hungry, the food is decent, but if you'd like to enjoy yourself with out the pause of, \""where the hell is ____\"", and \""how long ago did we ______\"",  go somewhere else."
1,"Visited for a full set of silk nails, she automatically put acrylic on my nails not the silk I had asked for. I didn't ask for them to be taken off because the whole point of silk nails is they are less damaging than acrylic but when I told her I asked for silk she said I asked for acrylic. I would never say acrylic if I wanted acrylic I would just say full set. So I didn't argue but my acrylic nails turned out very thick and bumpy. Had to go to another salon to they them thinned up and smoothed out. She also left them very long after I asked her to cut them shorter and made my cuticles bleed. After I pulled my hand away she said she was doing it on purpose because my nail sea are too short so she was \""helping me\""."
0,This place should be planted with orange trees. Very rough fairways and the owner doesn't know the first thing about customer service. Will not go back. The only saving grace is the hamburger and fries in the grill area. Would like to see them spend more money at great Eagle versus their other course Arizona Traditions.
2,"Just opened following winter over seeding. Course played surprisingly well. Tees and fairways were in good shape. The greens were really slow from the overseeing but held and putted very well considering. Expected to play \""automatic 2-putt\"" but all the greens were good. The rough was a golf ball eating monster. Deep heavy bermuda swallowed up shots and hid the balls. Would certainly play again."
1,Ehh its ok!! The location at bell & reems is 10x better!! Better service there & better drinks. This one is okey..
3,"I can't, for the life of me, remember the Barista who assisted me, but she was HILARIOUS and fun!  I would come back just for her customer service.  She was a little short blondie.  \n\nThe customer service was great.  It is located near a frozen yogurt place as well. Win!  Win!"
0,Slowest and most disorganized Starbucks ever! 25 minutes for 2 regular coffees and a pre-made spinach wrap.
2,"Always a great selection of arts and crafts.  Of particular note is the fact they have a good selection of plastic models such as cars, airplanes, ships, etc and all the needed supplies to assemble them including glues, cements, and paints.\n\nThe prices on the models range from $10 to $30 and seem to be quite a bit cheaper than Hobby Lobby and Hobby Bench which are competing stores in the area."
0,In the store today 2 times.....first AND last! I have never experienced such an unfriendly staff & the store is a mess.
0,"I went to Sarah's Hallmark yesterday for their Holiday sale and was very disappointed with the bait and switch tactics going on with the Vera Bradley bags. They were offering in their sale print ad one style of bag but when I got to the store, that bag was NOT the one they were offering with the sale price. And it wasn't because they didn't have it either!  When I asked the clerk about the proper price of the bag, she insisted that the owners made a mistake but that she couldn't offer the bag that was pictured at the discounted price. I told her this was bait and switch and asked her to call the owners to clarify. She wouldn't do it. You have to sell the bag pictured at the discounted price...plain and simple. Very disappointing."
0,"Sorry, folks...this is another Peoria/Surprise/Glendale pizza place I can take off my list.  Went there tonight - eat in - ordered a pepperoni & onion pizza.  I should have been concerned when it arrived and the pieces wouldn't break apart - with a kitchen knife and fork we were just barely able to cut them apart.  First bite...the crust was doughy and chewy and tasted strongly of flour.\nLong story short, the girl asked how things were, as she saw us eating the toppings and leaving the crust.  We told her of the crust and her response was \""Sorry.\""  I can't explain the 5 stars vs my one star, all I know is what the pizza was tonight.  Never, ever, again."
3,Pretty decent location for a nice target store.\nWhen I lived in the area I would frequent this target location and was happy with the service and product selection.\nLocated in the surprise town center shopping district alongside many great shops.
0,WORST STORE EVER!! Had to wait 45mins to pick up a padio set!!! Soo disorangized.. WORST SERIVICE!! Iam so disgusted i will never ever return!! HOME DEPOT ONLY!
4,"Very good food!! A nice, clean and very friendly place. Prices are reasonable for authentic Mexican food. We have eaten there many times and always look forward to going back."
0,I was there in the afternoon on December 31. Someone took a sharp object to the side of my car and the rear panel. They did $1200 in damage. Called Harkins and wasn't even told by manager that he was sorry. Had to write Harkins to even get an apology.
0,"If you love cocky pieces of crap that will try and rip you off and have no clue what there talking about .. I would highly recommend this place , If you want to go to a real Harley dealership with heart and soul and its family owned,  Buddy Stubbs is awesome I will never go anywhere else . Everyone there is really chill and incredibly knowledgeable and they actually treat you with respect .."
2,First arrived and the family a little bored. The staff was nice but the displays need to improve. Great building. Luckily the simulation our family signed up for saved the day. We had a great time with the simulation crew. End if day it all worked out great and family happy.
4,"Meaghan has been doing my hair for 18years and she is amazing! I have followed her all over the city! She is very precise on her color, blending highlights and a perfect hair cut every time! I highly recommend give her a try and I promise you will be in love. She is also very reasonable priced for the excellent services! I love going to see her!"
0,"I have been to Great Clips a number of different times and have always been satisfied but my visit there on Thursday, 01/16/2014, was the last time I will ever go there again!!!!! It was at the Great Clips in the Deer Valley Marketplace located at the corner of W. Deer Valley Road & N. 83rd Ave. in Peoria.  When I first got there one of the women looked my name up under my phone number and put me on the waiting list. Then another woman called me up to the counter and asked for my name. I told her my name and she said it wasn't there. Then she asked for my phone number. I told her but I had to repeat it several times. She was very rude and was extremely hard to understand due to her accent. She said her name was Nina (later when I looked at the receipt it showed her name to be Niculina). She directed me to a chair and asked me how I wanted my hair cut. I asked her if she could check the notes in the computer to see how it had been cut the last few times I had been in because I wanted it cut the same way. She walked over to the computer and looked at it for a few seconds and said \""something happened to computer, there's nothing\"" and walked back to the chair. I told her how I wanted it cut but she wanted to do it differently. I told her no to do it like I said. Well after she cut my hair (If you can call it that) I asked her if she could rinse my hair off in the sink, not shampoo just rinse with water so I could get all the extra cut hair off and she said no she would have to charge me for a shampoo. So I asked if I could do it myself and she said no. Then she immediately put gel in my hair without even asking if I wanted any in my hair. It was ok because I use gel in my hair anyway but I thought it was odd. Well after I got home from having dinner I took a shower and my wife looked at me and said OMG!!! Your hair!!! Go look at it!\"" It is REALLY REALLY BAD! I have bald spots in a number of places where my hair is cut all the way to the scalp! How does someone do that?! Then there are other places that have long hairs that she did not even cut! To top it all off when I looked at my receipt she didn't even spell my name correctly, it reads Brayen not Brian??? I have e-mailed them and also called their corporate office and I am still waiting for them to call me back. The sad thing is I am job hunting and now I have hair that looks like a monkey cut it for bananas. I'm not saying ALL the stylists there are bad but if you do go there just make sure you DO NOT have Niculina (Nina) cut your hair."
0,"Honestly I REALLY don't like this location. I've never had a positive experience here. I eat at other locations at least a couple of times in the week and I won't go to this one anymore. The portions are skimpy compared to other locations. They are not friendly in the least. And make me feel like I'm being a burden (since I'm ordering a large order to go.) I'm more than happy to let others go in front, but even when I'm the only one in there I feel like I'm bothering them. The locations on 75th and bell and 59th and the 101 are my go to locations. Always so friendly and welcoming!"
1,"I came on a Monday... They were out of veal and steak. My dish was the spicy sausage rigatoni which good, not great. My wife had the shrimp pasta Alfredo... Disappointing! Sauce was plain. Turns out the sauce is already shipped here and they don't add any more spices to it. The shrimp tasted like the store bagged ones. Their bread was delicious. The mozzarella fritti was less than ok.  Staff was welcoming. The reason i gave it a 2 was because my dish was OK but my wife's dish was just not good. The Kraft's macaroni n cheese taste a lot better. Also, they were out of two main meats. Will not come back, unless i don't find a better Italian food. Im from Santa Barbara and have travelled all over the world and the states... By the way, my daughter ordered a pizza, which she says she enjoyed."
0,Not impressed by the food. \nAtmosphere is crowded. Maybe they will be on Restaurant Hoarders. \nWaiter was a jerk. I asked for another and got one but she was dumber than a box of rocks (i didnt mean to insult rocks) \nToo expensive to deal with waiters with attitude and mediocre food!
1,"Went earlier this evening with 2 people who have never been. Giving a 2/5 because the food was good, when we eventually got it. Otherwise, poor service!\n\nWe sat down at 4, the bartender took our drink order and while my friend was ordering an appetizer, the bartender walked off. Strike 1. \n\nWhen she came back a couple of minutes later, we placed our order, and we received the bread at about 415. We then received our garlic bread order at 430. At 445, the bartender came over, told us that the kitchen had been taking longer than usual (we were one of only 2 groups of people on that side of the room except for 3 people at the bar, otherwise the whole place was pretty empty), and that our food would be ready in a few minutes, and she took my drink to refill it. At 5, we still had not received our dinner order, the bread on the table had gone cold, and I still had not received my refilled drink back yet. Strike 2. \n\nAt 515, over an hour since we were seated, we finally received our food, and she asked us if we needed anything else. I told her she still had not brought my refilled drink back, and she gave me a blank look like I was retarded. I told her she took my drink earlier to refill it, and never brought it back. She then realized that I wasn't nuts, and brought me a new glass. I was upset (I didn't say anything to her) but it was obvious on my face and she told me she realized that she did forget to bring my drink back, so apologized for that. but it wasn't her fault that the kitchen staff got our food out slow. Strike 3. \n\nI like the Mesa location a lot, but this one definitely did not leave a good impression on my friends, and myself - will not be bringing them back to this one."
1,"Although we visited on a Saturday evening, we arrived around six, we were seated within 10 minutes because the restaurant was not very busy.  We were taken to a table which was not yet cleaned. After waiting a while for a waiter to take our drink order finally the manager took the order.  A nearby waiter recognized that we had been sitting for a long time without drinks or a waiter.  Because of him our waiter arrived a short time later and took our order.  We would have enjoyed our mozzarella garlic bread while we waited for our entrees, but it all arrived all together. The food, with the exception of the bread, was lukewarm at best.  While several tables around us cleared out, I never saw a busboy clear the tables.  We were disappointed by the discombobulated staff and disorganization in every step of our dining experience.  I honestly doubt I will returned this location."
3,"It has been about 14 years since I last visited BDB.  It was the one on Ray Road in Chandler.\n\nWe found a $10 off coupon on Amazon Local and they are now pushing much smaller lunch specials starting at 6.99.  The person I was with had never been, so we stopped in at this location.\n\nThe food is always delish here.  The meatballs are so tasty and the sauce they use is so, so good.  We decided to share a \""regular\"" small salad and it was still too big.  She ordered the chicken parm and added a meatball.  I ordered the rigatoni with sausage and meat sauce.   Much to my luck, the waitress mistakenly entered my order wrong and ordered me a regular dinner \""small\"" rigatoni instead of the much smaller lunch portion.  YAHTZEE!  \n\nBDB is so good, and it's a great place for large parties with large portions and even larger appetites.  After the ginormous salad, we had 5 take home containers and will have food for the next few days.\n\nBDB is definitely worth the trip but be sure you are hungry and have at least 3-4 people."
4,"I went here on Friday night and had an excellent time. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive and the food was phenomenal. We got an order of wings and the firecracker spinach artichoke chicken (I think that's what it was called). If for nothing else, I will be returning to eat that again! They had a big open room wit pool tables that you can rent, so we played for a bit. Although I suck, it was still pretty fun and the tables were nice. After our meal, the manager came over t ask us how everything was and gave us a card for a free appetizer on our next visit. \n\nThis was the best food, service and overall great dining experience I have had in a while. I will definitely be back!"
3,"I attended an informal business meeting here a while back and I was really impressed with the level of service.  Waitresses were around often but were not intrusive or pushy.  The manager was also making the rounds to make sure everyone was being taken care of.  If you can't relax, have fun and enjoy yourself in this place perhaps you need to look inward my friend."
2,"Went to Fox & the Hound to watch an OSU basketball game.  Sat in the bar area, pretty dark and dismal, but eventually they figured out how to get the game on the big screen.  Nice TV's and plenty of seating.   Lunch was a bit pricey but not terrible.  Tried the signature turkey sandwich/club on a pretzel dough roll.   Very tasty, but add two draft beers and my bill was $15.00   didn't really think it was that steep of a bar/pub food kind of place but apparently so!  Overall, it was adequate for watching the basketball game and drinking a beer with lunch, but I doubt i'll be running back to return anytime soon."
1,"Wait staff is in need of training and this place generally seems confused as to what type of business they are. Front of building says \""Smokehouse and Tavern\"" which would lead many to believe that it's a restaurant with a bar. The reality is that it's a sports bar that serves food and that is exactly what I got when eating there, \""Bar Food\"". I ordered a blue cheese and bacon hamburger (over priced in my opinion). I explained to the waitress that I wanted the meat done just so it was a little pink in the middle and she said \""so we'll go with medium rare\"" , I went along with it figuring she worked there and she would know best since I explained in detail what I wanted. Result: It came out very rare and almost raw in my opinion (just barely browned on outside and all pink everywhere else), there was barely any blue cheese to taste on it and the bottom half of my bun was soaked in grease just like I would expect from a burger at a bar. \n\nMy summary: might be a good place to get a drink and watch the game, but eat at your own risk.\nP.S. I saw another reviewer compliment them on the lunch menu, I went during the dinner hour."
0,"It's Denny's--how bad can it be? Well let me tell you...this visit to Denny's was B.A.D. It was over 90 minutes from start to finish and we were seated immediately on a weekday morning. Food came out S.L.O.W and our server was even slower. We didn't get refills nor were they even offered. My husband's pancakes were burnt on the outside and still runny on the inside. The fruit that came with my breakfast had been frozen and wasn't quite thawed out yet. I have eaten at this Denny's before and while the service has never been all that stellar, this was by far the worst visit to a Denny's I've ever experienced and because it's Denny's my expectations are pretty low to begin with. Do yourself a favor and skip this particular Denny's. You will save yourself the aggravation."
4,"I have never had bad service at this location. The food is always spot on and I am greeted with a friendly hostess. Last night I went and no one greeted me, the service was slow (because they were busy and only had three waiters on) AND I still left satisfied. Alicia really helped us out and did a great job keeping our waters full and our food came as promptly as it could. GREAT customer service will keep me coming back to this location. \nPlus THUMBS UP for the new decor!"
4,"Call ahead. Eat lots of rolls. Get the double pork chop, and you will be in heaven. \n\nKey is to call ahead.\n\nIve never had a problem here and always loved my food."
0,"It's the holiday season! I'm out Christmas shopping and trying to buy my father a gift that I have been searching every Ross in the valley for. I finally find one and the box was opened, so I wanted to check it to make sure all parts were there... Two clerks walk past and call over a third to contact someone (loss prevention) to assist the situation. Accused of attempting to steal the item, she says that she cannot sell to me because the item is now opened. My friend and I told her it was already opened and we wanted to make sure all parts were there because it was a gift. She walked off to talk to her manager and once again was disrespected and talked down upon!! I will never do business with this Ross!!!!!!!!"
1,"food is still good, but the set up is ridiculous, yeah put the soda and ice cream right next to where the soups and pasta are to cause a huge log jam of people. Also had a hair in my salad, not cool."
1,"For the price we had to pay to stay here (min. $193/night), we expected a bit more \""customer-oriented\"" services, much like we get in just about every other hotel we've stayed at.  They do not provide any guest services publications whatsoever.  We had to go to the lobby to find out what restaurants were nearby, and were handed a list that someone happened to type up for them.  That was it...all it had were names, addresses and phone numbers.  We then asked for a tv listing, and again, were handed another list.  The point is, we had to ask for this information.  The electrical system in our room was totally screwed up.  Trying to figure out how to turn off a set of lights, while keeping one utility light on was a nightmare.  We ended up guessing which plugs to put the lamp cords in to, in order to not have to turn all the lights on/off in the room.  Also, this place is running on one of the tightest budgets we've seen yet.  Paper cups, no soap dish at the bathroom sink, one bottle of shampoo (no conditioner or moisturizer), and a single serving of coffee for the pot (pod-type).\n\nThe good thing about this place is the location.  It's right across the street from the ballpark, and there are restaurants and shopping within walking distance."
0,This Jack's has been closed!  Thank goodness since we got food poisoning from this place!  YUCK!
1,"I was seated quickly however no one told us that there were not enough chef's for the tables. So after 45 minutes of waiting we left because we had movie tickets.  (I have no idea when the chef actually came, my guess is an hour) I've enjoyed this place before, however, I doubt I'll come back. If a restaurant wants business they respect their customers. I appreciate it when the staff is honest with their patrons.  I prefer that they let us know ahead of time that there is a long wait and then I can make that decision myself if I want to wait or not. Instead I waited for 45 minutes thinking a chef was on his way any minute."
0,"THIS LOCATION ONLY - Echoing another user's review.  There is now a large sign in the lobby stating \""We no longer accept Restaurant.com gift certificates.  Sorry for the inconvenience.\""  Inconvenience?  We *purchased* a gift certificate for your restaurant, drove all the way down there, and you refuse to accept it?  That's just not right.  If you didn't want to participate you shouldn't have offered the certificates in the first place.  Take them off the website but you should still honor the ones previously purchased."
0,"I've been boycotting this store since 2009.  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids, I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the children's section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.  I'd been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the children's section had called the police on us.  She never asked the kids  their ages and didn't ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).  The police talked to them, realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers, and assured me I'd done nothing illegal.  Avoid like the plague."
1,"Not bad food, combined with so so service. I tried the firebird chicken pasta and i have had better at chilies. I also don't drink soda so i ordered a lemonaid and since it was made at the bar  (non-alcoholic) they were 4 bucks each. it sounds like im cheap but 4 dollars for some sugar, water, and lemon? then 4 dollars for a second one? ok. the place was nice and huge on the inside, if i was taking a client out i would go there for the appearance but for my son, wife, and myself i think next time ill pass."
1,"***DON'T*** GO TO CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY.  I was floored! $135 in food for 4 people to celebrate my husband's B-day and they don't do anything, we would have gone to the Black Angus or CARVERS they are near the same area, just as delicious steaks *and* less money $!!  At least at those places we would get a candle in a brownie just so we could say that we had him blow out a candle for his b-day.  I can't justify $28 entries that do not come with a soup or salad in this economic climate, and NO hospitality, so even though the food is good we won't be returning because we really only go for special occasions go to Carvers or Black Angus or even Outback! Before we return here!"
0,"Last night I met a friend for dinner.  She had a coupon for buy two appetizers get a free lobster/cheese appetizer.  I arrived first.  Stuck my hand in something sticky, and the appetizer plate was dirty.  She arrives and immediately announces the coupon and orders.  15 mins (or more) passes and the manager walks over to tell us we must order from the wood fire grill to use the coupon - would we like to change our order.  She ordered two entrees and I ordered a salad $15.95.  No thanks!  (Mind you why did it take so long to put the ap order in to begin with).  Another 10-15 mins goes by and he comes back over to try and sell again the \""up order\"" tells us there is nothing he can do.  I said, look I'm really hungry are you telling me you have still NOT put in our original entree order?  He says well, no!  We had by now been here 45 mins.  No aps and no order in!  He tries to explain this promo is being audited and he cannot do anything about it.  OK great.  Why are we still chatting and not getting food?  I got up and promptly left to go to Famous Daves.  Food-1/2 price and the place was PACKED and we still waited no time for really great food.\nMind you-I have been to Firebirds many times and have never been impressed with service but, this took the cake.  The food has always been good though.  What a shame!"
0,"Overall, not really impressed. Yet another example of how service can ruin a dining experience.\n\nCame here on Valentine's day with my boyfriend (we're a younger couple, but old enough to purchase alcohol). Immediately upon being seated, the server was terribly rude and standoffish presumably because he assumed we were younger than we looked and because we didn't immediately purchase alcohol. He made extremely snide remarks when he took our order, and was very short with us. What was even more frustrating was that we could see the difference in his demeanor towards us and towards the group that was sitting  at the table in front of us (that had a much larger tab). He didn't bother to check up on us during the entire meal service, and three different servers brought us drink refills. \n\nThe food was decent. Compared to similar style restaurants, it really didn't blow any place out of the water. It was just very average. I got a burger cooked rare, and it came out just as I requested. Like I said, though: average. We left considerably upset. \n\nA few days later, I was still bothered by the incident. We decided to call the manager to inform him of the way his employee had treated us. As someone who has worked in the food industry before, I understand the importance of customer service and I figured the manager should know about the quality service his employees are exhibiting. The manager was very apologetic and professional about the situation, but to be honest, I'm not completely sure I would return. \n\nThis could have been a three-star review for average food and professional management, but when your night gets tainted by terrible service, there isn't much room for negotiation (in my opinion)."
3,love the food
2,Came here for my sisters birthday dinner. It was a good time. My sister got the coconut shrimp dinner with a side lobster tail. She said it was all great.\n\nMy other sister got some kind of a chicken dinner with mashed potatoes. Her potatoes had cold spots throughout them but she said the chicken was good.\n\nI got the prime rib and it had the potential to be good but it was cooked to well. I told our waiter that I liked it really pink and he said to order it medium then. It came with no pink but it was tender along the outside. The middle was dry and chewy. The horseradish cream was really really good. \n\nI will give this place another try but I would send my dinner back next time if they did not cook the meat how I asked. I'm sure if I had said something they would have taken care of it. When your out to dinner for a celebration you just don't want anything to spoil it though.
1,"So I've admitted in the Biltmore location's review that I secretly LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location stinks.  \n\nLunch is always busy, and service (up to now) was so-so.  But most recently my co-workers took me to lunch here for my birthday, and here is how the exchange with our 22 year old skanky server went. I swear I am not making this up.  We place our orders and then my co-workers call over our server.  Let's call the 22 year old skanky server Tammy McSleazerston.\n\nCo-workers:  (point over at me like I'm not there, as if to request some kind of retarded ice cream, song and dance freebie) It's his birthday today, could we have some kind of something for him.\nTM:  (In baby voice, and taking her index finger and pointing at her right cheek) Aww, is it your boothday tuhday Mishtuh Man??\nMe:  (Stunned, and not knowing what to say)  Um yeah.\nTM says she'll be back, and walks away.\nMe and Co workers:  (Look at each other jaw-dropped)\n\nWe finish lunch, they give me my stupid ice cream, and we leave a crappy tip and a note to the manager to rein in his flippant servers -- and no apology, or other response."
1,"my boyfriend has wanted to take me to this restaurant for 3 years. we finally went on a special occasion. i was looking forward to a really good meal and nice ambiance. ok, so the food was way overpriced for what you got. we went for breakfast. the portion was average, nothing spectacular and it was pricey for what you got. the service was super slow. yes, it was busy, however, it was slower then slow. it was very noisy, putting a damper on our special occasion. the decor was the only nice thing about the visity. service blew. prices blew. nothing special. i could've went to a hole in the wall diner and got a heaping portion for less money and better service."
2,"If you're not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, the name should imply that their menu is full of flavorful high-calorie offerings. But it may not imply so well that this place is rather expensive-- on the border of outlandishly.\n\nHowever, their menu is extremely robust, I don't think I can recall another restaurant with so many different things on their menu. Their cheesecake is outstanding, of course, but some of their other menu items can be hit or miss. (For example, their Buffalo Blasts are not as good as they sound, but everything else we tried was rather decent)\n\nIt's a good place to go for a special occasion, I can't really say don't go-- but for the same (or less) money I can get higher quality at other places."
0,"Average to poor food. I've had orange chicken, a salad, and chicken enchiladas. They all sucked. They all cost more then they should have."
3,"Super cool bar, friendly staff and very comfortable environment. Drinks and food are both very affordable and delish. Great happy hour specials too. It's s small establishment so it can get busy. But it's always fun no matter what."
1,"I really hate their food. Everything is disgusting. The wings, the shrimp, the oysters, EVERYTHING. We went there and I love fish and chips so I ordered it. One bite and I was done. It was awful. Puke worthy awful. I ended up only eating the curly fries that came with it. Anyway, the manager noticed I didn't eat any of it, so he decided to take it off our bill which was super nice. It was one star food, but because the manager was nice enough to acknowledge the fact that I didn't like it so I shouldn't have had to pay for it, was why they got another star. Way to go on customer service!"
4,It's a good thing that this place is not closer to where I live or I would weigh 400 pounds.
4,"We bought a couple of party trays for my birthday and I have to say, it can feed a whole battalion. Not only was there a lot of food, it was also delicious, as usual. Thank you, Greek Wraps!"
3,"When we used to live in Peoria, we would go to Greek Wraps about once a week. Their hummus is to die for. I've actually never had anything less than terrific there. Everything from the veggie pita wrap with grilled eggplant and onions smothered with their special yogurt sauce to their grilled lemon kebab with garlic sauce is amazing. \n\nThere is always a line at Greek Wraps and expect a wait. The food is made fresh to order and the portions are plentiful. \n\nI wish they had delivery!"
4,The food is amazing here. I've been here a few times and love it every time. I ordered the gryro platter and it comes with a Greek salad and rice. I have to say everything was delicious.
3,So yummy! I get 1 gyro and order an extra pita. They put enough meat in 1 that you can split into 2!
3,"A Geico customer hit our car and was responsible.  Geico sent us to Larry Miller in Glendale. (I really wanted to go to Moore in Glendale)    I was told by Geico to call and get an appointment time.  I was amazed at the fine  reception.  Upon arrival, a Geico man met me and checked the damage.  All of 10 minutes and one cup of comp coffee.  He sent me over to the on-site Enterprise and Geico, as promised, took care of my rental car (However, Enterprise was slow as hell in having the promised car available - couldn't even find the Geico request????).\nSo this is 4 stars for Geico and Miller!\nMy only complaint - the repair took 10 working days - most of which was waiting for parts.  My car was very driveable.  So why did I have to leave my own car and drive the very poor Enterprise Car?\nBTW, 2 stars for the Enterprise portion!"
2,The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there.
1,"I ordered lasagna, dinner salad and soup.  The Italian wedding soup tasted just like Italian dressing.  It used to be so good. I was so disappointed in it that I saved it for a week to get a refund since I only took two bites but never found the time to take it in and deal with the manager I spoke to that seemed hesitant to provide a refund vs. a replacement product. All the herby delicious flavor was gone and sweet, sweet, sweet took over. Don't they know not to mess with a good thing. Either they changed the recipe or they have a lazy cook.\n\nThe lasagna was good but also really sweet. The portion for the price was disappointing. For that much money, I will just make a pan at home and freeze some portions.  \n\nThe dinner salad was fantastic. Full of yummy, crispy veggies. If the lettuce had been drained and the dressing didn't come out of a bottle with so much sugar it could gag you, I would get that salad twice a week. \n\nI won't be returning for anything BUT the salad, and only if I have my own dressing.\n\nBummer update."
2,"I came here on Saturday on a second hand store rummage day out with my husband and I just have to say that I don't get it, Savers.  \n\nI. Don't. Get. It.\n\nFirst let me start by pointing out something that you guys may have forgotten, you are a secondhand store, not a resale store for gently used merchandise or even a consignment shop.  There *is* a difference.  Your stuff is no nicer than a standard Goodwill's stuff, yet you think you can command about twice the price for your stuff??   Uh, no.\n\nYeah, it's clean and organized in comparison to a Goodwill, but it still smells like my grandma's closet, or maybe even my musty garage after a humid day.  Why?  Because it's STILL a secondhand store, full of unwashed goods, of questionable provenance, from other people.\n\nI found a wall mounted coat rack that I really liked and would have purchased, but it was $10.   Uh, sorry, but that isn't that awesome of a deal.  And my husband found some well loved, North Face snow pants that would have been a good deal for something slightly less than the $25 they wanted for them, AND if they hadn't also been ripped at the bottom so I would have had to mend them anyway...  c'mon Savers, really?\n\nAdding to all this is the fact that they weren't even offering any kind of point of sale discount, coupons, nothing...  At least Goodwill was running a 50% off everything deal that same day.  I did hear an overhead announcement that said that if you register online with Savers and give them your email address they'll send you coupons, but who really wants Spam from a secondhand store?  I certainly don't.  I much prefer a point of sale discount that requires no sharing of my personal contact information, thankyouverymuch.\n\nSaver's whether you guys like it or not, Goodwill IS your competition, so you better step up your game to actually compete with them.  I'll be clear, I'm not cheap and I'd like to consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of the secondhand stores across the Valley (hell, I was raised shopping in secondhand stores) but I refuse to pay those kinds of prices for that kind of merchandise.  \n\nYou guys need to reexamine your pricing structure because it kinda sucks."
2,"\""I am a way picky Mex eater partially because I had the luxury of growing up with real authentic mex food thanks to my grandparent's. My mother in law has to go here every time she visits AZ which I always am ehhh about Abuelos nothing special about the food just the atmosphere really =-o The chips and salsa are very good thin crispy not greasy, perfect really.So this last time we went was THE last time I go there PERIOD. My MIL even said she remembered the food being better, while it was never a big deal for me.\n\nIt was my daughter's b-day. The service was awful! The server was Russian she couldnt understand much of anything. We had 2 toddlers with us and ordered 1 kid's plate for them to share well she brought 2 anyway and when we explained once again only 1 was ordered she was going to take plate #2 back and throw it in the bin, we then told her nevermind we'd keep the plate instead of wasting food for her mistake. We had the seared tuna starter pretty good and unexpected and something you dont see too often at mexican. I had the tortilla soup it was not good I have had 100x better from Red Robin, it didnt have any tortilla in it I asked what the deal was. She said it comes with a side of crunchy tort strips she had forgotten to bring out. I had the Green Chile con Chicken quesadilla - the chicken to be safe. I had a Mojito it was under their signature cocktails, it was the worst I have ever had anywhere\"" I sent it back wanting more cool mint taste she took forever but there was no change in my drink I left it untouched. We were a party of 6 no one was too happy with their dinner the kid's loved their chicken nuggets but they are kid's and love mcd's. We got the bill and were still charged for the horrible mojito and 2nd kids plate that was not ordered but would have gone in the bin. They did however concauct some desert for my daughter which she loved and was free maybe because her bday!?!?! Who know's but I won't be going back!"
3,Have been here to dine a few times. and went for happy hour on a friday night.  Very decent prices and the food is great. The place was busy but we are able to belly up to the bar. Will be back for sure.
3,"I am hemming and hawing about 3 or 4 stars.  I'm going to go with 4 because I have had so many bad dining experiences at chains lately.  This, obviously, was not one of the bad ones.  \n\nFirst, let me say thank you to Abuelos for having a decent happy hour (gasp, seven days a week).  The drinks are priced great and there is a large variety of food at very low prices.  Second, this place was packed when we went in.  It was either sneak into a seat at the bar or wait 30 minutes.  We chose the bar.  The service was very fast and attentive despite the crowd.  Third, and finally, the food was genuinely good.  The ingredients were fresh, the salsas were flavorful, the chips light and crispy and it was all presented nicely. \n\nI know that normally decent food, served properly by people who are attentive should not be that big of a deal but, lately I have a hard time finding even the basics.  It was very nice to go out, order something interesting and be served the food just as it should be."
1,"Fancy place.  Not great food. \n\nThis place is a fancy, expensive Mexican restaurant for people what to spend more money than they should and get far less than good Mexican food.  I guess if you're from Minnesota, Wisconsin or BC this is passible, but it is far from good Mexican food."
4,"Great service, lots of tasty options spinach enchiladas were delicious also chips and salsa they give you are great, the green salsa is my favorite! Will be back to try more."
1,"Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, covered with velveeta cheese. Rice has no flavor and the refried beans were oddly crusty. We will never go back."
2,"Good food (if \""good\"" can be associated with fast food) - but the drive-thru here is one of the slowest I have used.\n\nYou come to fast food and a drive-thru for a QUICK and easy meal. The easy part they did.. the quick part turned into a 15 min wait from order to eating. Way to long in my opinion."
2,"Whataburger has a decent burger, but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food. This location hasn't been too busy on the few occasions that I have dined here though, so it has been quick and convenient for me."
0,First time ever there!!!  Ordered a salad with apples and cranberries among other things...no apples in the salad..what's the point of paying extra for a salad if you are not getting what is supposed t o be in it??  Never again!  I hate rip offs!!!  P.s.  Their french fries suck...my husband ordered them and their hamburgers were not even thick!
0,"worst return policy in the world!\neven with a receipt! be careful if you do a partial payment with a gift card!!\n\nExperience 1 - I purchased Nip/Tuck season whatever ($40), a sweater ($28) and the Black Eyed Peas cd ($12) online from target.com. I paid mostly with my debit card, but I had used the last $9 of a gift card as well.\nI printed the order confirmation everything showed exactly as I ordered it. I get my items and instead of the Black Eyed Peas Cd I get the Nip Tuck soundtrack. I go to return it to the store. I can'y because althought they carry the cd, that portion of the order was fulfilled by amazon.com NOT target.com. So I bought the cd there in store and called target to find out about returning it for a refund and a credit on the shipping. They would only refund the cd to the gift card and no refund on shipping since the nip tuck soundtrack was on the invoice, it must be my mistake even though my order confirmation shows no signs of the nip tuck sndtrk. When I read them their own return policy stating simply that refunds will be credited to the original form of payment and since the cd was priced higher than the value of the gift card the refund should be credited to my debit card. The representative then lead me to a SECOND return policy that was similar but stated that the entire amount would be refunded to the gift card since i used a target gift card for a portion of the payment. Now to get to this second refund, I had to type the URL into the address bar of my browser. The rep was unable to tell me how to navigate to it from their site. There were no links to get to it. It was a static page that required you to type the address in manually. How would I have ever known that??\n\nExperience2 - I purchased some nice metal shower curtain hooks ($16). They kept catching on the shower rod tho as the rod was too thick around. I went to return them. I had no receipt and I paid cash. My fault.  I went to exchange it for a $65 mirror which I was told I cannot do since I didn't have the receipt I could only exchange it for something of equal or greater value (the mirror was greater) and from the same department. IT WAS FROM THE SAME STORE WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT DEPARTMENT IT WAS FROM??\nOh and I couldn't get store credit I had to use it that same day."
1,"This would have been a 5 star review, but they charged me an extra $20 after check out for no reason! They asked for a credit card when I checked in, \""Just to have on file for incidentals...it won't be charged.\"" At least that's what I was told! There isn't any incidentals to be had at this hotel. No mini bar, no snacks in the room, and no drinks in the fridge. So what was the charge for? I used my own soap and lotion, and even paid double for some drinks and snacks at the snack bar downstairs...it just aggravates me. My friend stayed at the same time in a different room and was also charged the $20 after check out, so beware since it must be standard here!"
3,You can rarely go wrong here.\n\nLove the chips & salsa!\n\nHave become a big fan of Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad!
3,Love the outdoor patio!  The perfect venue for relaxing with music and a cold beer.
1,"My mouth has a weird aftertaste. It could of been the cockroach that scurried across the floor and ended up in my burger. Free wings on Monday night football. That's cool. \nCheap beer. They raised over$1,000 for a nonprofit one night for local teens in need of help. That's cool. We are in Wickenburg"
2,"I work in Wickenburg so the options for food are limited. I do enjoy the chicken Parmesan plate or sandwich here. The Greek salad is tasty too, but overpriced a bit. I call in my order ahead of time and its usually ready to go by the time I get there. The people are always helpful and friendly. It doesn't get more stars because I don't have much to compare it to in town, I'm a spoiled city girl who is used to a higher level of restaurant, and I've only tried a couple things so I'm not able to give a complete review with a higher rating."
0,"This was a brightly lit place with a trailer feel that had table clothes on tables that filled a plain rectangular single room.  There was plenty of help running around ignoring the four of us for a bit and then the excitement started when we ordered and was told how many things they did not have like bacon, cheddar cheese and the like.  It was a \""steak place\"" and they proved it by charging between $25 and $37.  We had a bad enough feeling about the place and didn't chance that by just ordering hamburgers and fries and with a drink each that came to $31.  Flavor probably would have been extra.  Go anywhere also."
4,Great food.  Very clean.  If you have special dietary needs they are able to accommodate just ask nicely.  Try them you won't be diss appointed.
2,"Stopped by this Subway on the drive back home to Vegas from Phoenix.  It is conveniently located on the right side of the road heading to Vegas.\n\nI ordered a 6\"" BMT w/Jalapeno Cheddar Bread & had it toasted.  I added Tomatoes, Lettuce, Green Peppers, Pepperoncinis, Mustard, Mayo, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper.  They made it quickly and I was eating in no time.\n\nThe ingredients were very fresh and the Sandwich tasted great.  A nice snack for the ride home.\n\nA bonus is the clean restrooms....a quick tip is to stop here to use the restroom instead of a nasty gas station....every gas station in Wickenberg was busy with travelers using the restrooms.\n\nWill I return?  Next time I drive to/from Phoenix, I will."
0,This subway has terrible service. The food is just ok and the space is not well kept.
0,Food was bland.  Service was slow.  Screwed up my bill - chased me down in the parking lot to get me to come back to pay more.
4,"This is perhaps the BEST chinese food I have ever had.  Everywhere I go I try the local chinese food restaurants.  I have lived in Orlando, Pearl Harbor, Charleston, Seattle, Guam, Flint, near Flagstaff, and now near WIckenburg.\n\nNo one seems to do from scratch egg rolls anymore, not positive these are from scratch but if they are not they are exquisite nontheless.  The crab angels are awesome as well and if you get any of the dinner for 2 combinations you get 1 for each person & soup.   The egg drop soup is blah, but not terrible.\n\nThe chicken dishes that are supposed to be crunchy, are crunchy.  The dishes that are supposed to be spicy, are spicy without being overpowering.   My significant other cant have things too hot, and she enjoyed our spicy dishes.\n\nOnly been here twice.  The food was awesome both times.  The manager/owner was very cordial to us, but did seem on very friendly terms with what we assume were regulars.  Joking and kidding with them.  If they were not regulars, then the interactions would seem quite hostile.  She made me and my fiancee seem like special guests, perhaps even friends of the her family.\n\nOnly thing I have to complain about is the bathrooms.  You have to exit the building.  The bathrooms are not airconditioned, in the summer in AZ that can be quite hot!"
4,"Stopped here today on my way through town on the recommendation of a friend and was glad I did. Had the corned beef hash Anita style and it was awesome! Delicious corned beef hash kicked up with jalapenos. If you like spicy and you like corned beef you will love it! I got it served with some corn tortillas and salsa on the side. Was the best breakfast i have had this month. \nService here was also over the top, they kept my coffee cup full and I really needed it this morning since i had to get up at 4am today. \n\nI'll definitely be back here next time I go through Wickenberg"
4,"There is a reason why this was voted as the best place to stop on a road trip by AZ Highway magazine.  Deb the owner is great and takes you back to a time where things were a little slower and personable.\n\nThere is nothing on the menu that you could go wrong with but the \""El Burro\"" is definitely a favorite when I'm not in the mood for the world-class biscuits and gravy...and yes when she says you really should order the half-portion, she means it."
2,"It's a Taco Bell and Pizza Hut Express combo, what more could you really ask for?!"
3,"ShooGoo was sort of a template 4-star place: good food, American menu, big ole portions, and nice service. It lacked the special zsa zsa zsu needed for 5 starrs.\n\nMy filet with B\u00e9arnaise sauce was excellent. The highlight of our meal, however, was our mushroom with Gorgonzola appetizer. Mmm.\nAnd, of course, they have the nice view, though that was pretty pervasive throughout Sedona.\nsunny az... yow, bill"
2,"Food was absolutely delicious,  but pricey. We were dressed in comfortable clothing (jeans/shorts/sweatshirts) and clearly did not fit in; this is a dressy crowd. We were also the youngest people there... it was mostly older adults 65+. Great views and good service."
4,"We went here again after discovering this great restaurant last time we visited Sedona.  Not only does it have a great sunset view of the beautiful  Thunder mountain but it has fabulous food.  The wait staff is very friendly & professional too.  Both the rack of lamb that I had and the scallops that my husband had were delicious.  The portions are generous and the meals come with soup or salad, hot bread, vegetable and rice or potato. It's a must try when visiting Sedona."
1,McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.
1,"Every time I play here something makes me angry. Today was slowness. Usually it's service and miserable people but today all staff I encountered were very nice. We played 13 holes in 3 hours and waited at least 5 minutes if not more per hole. Don't go here if you want to play a quick round and don't use the vending machine on the 4th hole. Wasted half my day waiting so we just left. I will say the greens were in excellent shape which is why I gave 2 stars not 1! I am a self proclaimed golf snob so I may be a little bit dramatic but when I pay $30 and barely get through half a round, this is what I have a problem with."
1,"As another reviewer mentioned, this location is notorious for having out of date items on the shelves. \nI have purchased numerous items that were out of code without noticing.\nWhen you are shopping for a whole week's with of groceries, or in a rush, it is difficult to check the date on every item you pick up and put in your cart (not to mention that the store is responsible for pulling items that are expired for consumer safety).\n\nThe store seems to be cutting back recently as well, and this doesn't bode well for the already sub par service. \nIt means waiting in longer lines, as well as being forced to use the self checkout because only one(or two at most) regular checkstand is ever open."
1,"I didn't think it was very good. We got the chicken fried rice, paper wrapped chicken, shrimp pad thai & sesame chicken - none of which was really good. The fried rice was horrible. I don't know why this place is so busy."
1,"It's just ok.  At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy.  In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach.  I think we'll have to find another place."
1,I am writing this litterally as I eat a piece of their pie. I can not get why people find thing place so good for pie. The chocolate Satin is a little salty and the crust breaks a little too easily for my taste. But you cant expect much I guess since they do not make pies in house.\nStick with small bakeries .
4,"I went in to John Mario's a bit skeptical - you never know what you're going to get with any given hair salon. This was the first time I'd had my hair cut in Vegas, so I went completely off of online reviews (like this one). \n\nI requested a fairly challenging hair cut from my barber, Bill. I pulled up a photo of the style I liked on my phone and showed it to him. After studying it and talking it through with me, Bill went straight to work. Watching him work with the clippers was absolutely mesmerizing - you can tell the guy is a pro. I watched in awe as he shaped my raggedy mop into a style nearly identical to the photo I had showed him just 20 minutes earlier. The end result FAR exceeded my expectations! \n\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend John Mario's - especially Bill. He's as talented with a pair of scissors and clippers as I've seen, and he can absolutely create the exact look you want."
2,"I came here with my mom to order take out because she really likes this place. I already have a place to eat Chinese, but she was driving. The place was clean. They have pictures of food up, but I couldn't tell what any of them were. \n\nThe service was good. I had a Sprite from the fountain, or what I thought was a Sprite. When I took a sip it was not Sprite. I told the guy at the counter and he said ok and made no effort to check the machine. Then I tried the Lemonade. That was water. When I went to pour it out, there were floaties of I don't know what in my cup. I sat down thinking they would get to the machine, but they didn't. \n\nThey have lunch specials that go till 4p.  Unfortunately, we had gone in the evening, so I'm not sure of the portions they serve, but their prices are reasonable and about the same as other restaraunts. \n\nI had Udon soup which was good. At the same time unappetizing because I kept thinking about the machine. I'm all about supporting small businesses, but first impression is key."
2,After reading the reviews for this place me and my roommate decided to stop by for lunch. The lunch specials are priced very nicely (6 bucks) and the portions are filling. The service was choppy but the woman had her hands full with her baby girl. I would come back.
2,"My Grandma was looking for a good Chinese take-out place nearby, so we checked out this place, based on the Yelp! reviews. My Grandma got the Lemon Chicken and really enjoyed it. I ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken. I asked them to make it hot (9 of 10). I didn't really like the taste, it wasn't very hot & the consistency was strange. I've had Panang at several restaurants & this was some of the worst, unfortunately. The service was adequate, so I'll probably try it again, but I'll be ordering something else instead."
4,Great environment and great price. Ask for Zulma or Rachel. Zulma can do a killer fade.
1,"Very poor service at the jewelry counter...I stood there 5 minutes before the clerk \""Sammy\"" even acknowledged my presents. He was walking around the store talking to co-workers. A simple \""I'll be with you in a moment\"" would be a big plus! When he finally did come over to help me he wasn't very knowledgeable about his own merchandise. But he did have very fresh minty breath though...just saying."
2,"Pretty good pizza.  This place isn't far from my house, so I'll probably go back.  Not as good as my beloved Grimaldi's, but it's plenty good for the price."
3,"My parent's love this place and now, so do I.  It is New York Style pizza (thinner crust and longer slices) very much like we got back home in NY.  Dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good!"
2,"Good food. It takes a little bit longer for them to make the sandwiches because they freshly slice the meat & cheese, but no complaint there, it's fresh and tastes way better than subway. They are limited on the veggies they offer, would like to have cucumber and bell peppers available.  I really like their mayo/mustard mix."
4,I love this Port of Subs! The staff is very friendly and make me feel at home. Everything is very neat and clean and I always get what i want. I have been going here for several years now and the staff changes pretty often but everyone is always nice. I would recommend this place over any other locations.
3,"Well I'm leaving the hotel tomorow morning so I guess I'm technically still a guest, but oh well haha.\n\nBeds are pretty comfortable, the shower has decent room and water pressure [I hate when hotel showers just drip, it's annoying n difficult], n my only complaint is that they have the cheapest toilet paper is the world--wtf is that about?\n\nTo get to the pool, get in the side entrance, n use the elevators requires your room key. Kinda weird in my opinion but I guess that's a good idea so random people can't just wander into the hotel or pool area. So safety-wise, a plus.\n\nOh, n there's a Starbucks on the Casino floor sooooo there are NO coffee pots in the hotel rooms and NO refrigerators. Kinda random. At least you have one of those ice cups if you wanna run down the hall to get ice for an ice chest or somethin.\n\nBuffet style eating here is pretty good. They have a whole section for sugar-free deserts if you're concerned about that kinda thing. The buffet line is split into each type of food: Asian, Americana, Mexican, n Dessert!\n\nOur hotel room was on a non-smoking floor which was nice. But there are also floors that allow smoking.....but if you smoke on a non-smoking floor there's a sign that says there will be a $100 violated fee haha so don't do it.\n\nThe pool in the back area of the hotel is about three feet deep but it's designed pretty cool almost like the edge overflows kinda like a fountain.\n\nHooter's, Regal Cinema's, n a bowling alley are attached to the hotel/casino. There's plenty of places around like Walmart n Target or Walgreen's to go get anything you might need outside of the hotel close by. Convenience is always great.\n\nOverall, it's a good place to stay. Good for families n whoever else wants to stay. Oh n by the way, the downstairs casino area is decorated like it's outdoors---reminded me of an old Disneyland ride lol fake sky n etc!"
1,"I'm rating this a three star for my overall experience with this casino in general. The first time I've ever been here was just for the buffet. The BF said he's come here since a child with his family and they had the \""best\"" buffet. EH, yea, I'm sure it was back in the days!! It was mediocre. The reason why I'm giving it a three star instead of a one or two is because they had these two amazing ladies who helped us sign up for their rewards program. They were so attentive yet not pushy like the other \""younger\"" strip casino waitresses. \n\nBesides all of the above, I would not stay at this hotel again. I only stayed in Vegas for one night, it was cheap, but saving the extra $40 wasn't worth it. The bed was HARD, the room service and front desk people were not friendly whatsoever. I mean, what happened to those two ladies a year ago?! They also never explained what the room charges were. There were two different taxes, the $14.99 amenity charge which were DID NOT use - asked them if they could waive it because their WIFI didn't even work!! it was SLOWER THAN A SNAIL..... \n\nOH their shower head leaks and sprays water EVERYWHERE and if you didn't know what the hell to do, you're basically SOL (you had to turn the shower head left and right so stop the spraying. As for LADIES, beware, they have the worse lighting to do make up - it's a incandescent light which makes it yellow, but it was the worse one ever to where, you couldn't even tell if your foundation/powder blended well, so that was a total bummer to go out without knowing if my make up was ok or not. \n\nThe only reason why we really take this 20 min drive out this way, is because we like the outside environment. It makes it feel like you're home because the grocery store, CVS, local restaurants are all down the same street. Beats spending a fortune for one meal. \n\nAlthough, I wish they had a microwave/fridge in their deluxe rooms. EH, like I mentioned before, this was a BUST. Will not stay here again..AND I change my mind, it's now a 2 instead of a 3. That's how sad I am about this place. Such a disappointment."
1,"(My fiancee and I stayed here 3 1/2 weeks ago. I'm just going to be brief and go over the pros and cons of the place because it was nice, but not \""great\""; we'll probably stay here again if we can't find a better option-)\n\nCons:\n\n1.The Weather: \n\nBe warned! Vegas is a *desert*: We went in May thinking it's be cool-ish and mild-ish: It wasn't!! It was very muggy (It rained) and very, very windy-felt like the inside of a hairdryer every time we went outside; the hot, high winds (Gusts up to 60+ mph) made \""walking the strip\"" very unenjoyable. Our bad and we'll more than likely not go there between the months of May-August next time, but still; I hate being cramped up inside! :/\n\n2. Our Trip (Cut Short due to the Weather): 2 stars off\n\nMy fiancee and I were booked here for 4 days but ended up leaving a day early due to inclement weather. I know it's not fair of me to take a couple of stars off, but we had really been looking forward to relaxing poolside and getting a cabana each day, only to find the pool open only 1 day out of what would've been 4: Blah. :/\n\n3. The Weird WIFI and \""Fine Print Resort Fee\"" Charges: 1 star off\n\nAdditionally, they have this Game that they play where they \""say\"" you get \""Free WIFI\"" in your Room but you're charged the fee for it and it's \""taken\"" out of your Resort Fee at the end...something like a charge-back it was explained to us..Yeah, okay, sure sounds shady...BUT I want to clearly state that after looking over our statement after our Trip, we were charged-back the WIFI fees..but we had this nagging, in-the-background-uncomfortable, \""will they charge it back or not\"" feeling, which put a small damper on our enjoyment. I also think that they should've been way, way more \""upfront\"" about the Resort Fee vs. making it a \""fine print\"" item that you kind've..discover upon checking in. :/\n\nPros:\n\n1. The Oyster Bar: Pretty decent, I've had better, but not bad for Vegas.\n\n2. No nasty smoke smell\n\n3. Clean, quite rooms (Albeit slightly worn down)\n\nAll in all, my fiancee adores this Casino and wants to stay here again. Me, not so much; there's plenty of other places to stay that I'd like to check out..."
3,"I totally love Station Casinos!  Bowling alley, movie theater, and gambling all in one place.  What a concept! \n\nSunset Station is in a great location surrounded by a ton of shopping so sometimes we find ourselves just stopping in.  \n\nWe came by with my folks who were visiting and my mother, who will only gamble on ONE type of slot machine lol, stopped an employee to asked if they had any of this machine.  She went out of her way to walk my mother to the other side of the casino to the slot machine she was looking for.  Knowing that I was a local (my mother told her) she asked if she could sign my parents up for their own Boarding Passes so that I could get credit for it under mine. She took each of their ID's, walked away for less than 5 minutes, and came back with their cards.  That was really nice and I got extra points for them signing up... \n\nThe casino (and bathrooms) always seem clean, albeit a little smokey, so I knocked a star off for that.  But otherwise I really like visiting this place!"
4,This is a great hotel. They have an awesome pool. It is in a good location. The maids are always nice and clean the rooms well. The rooms are nice and comfortable. I have come here with my family 3 times and it has always been great.
2,"Older hotel, but fairly clean.  Just needs some TLC.  Staff and security friendly, restaurants have good food.  Service good.  Games are decent and I didn't feel like my $60 spent on gaming went too fast.  I enjoyed myself.  I'd probably stay here again.  Their $35/night is, of course, loaded up with resort fees, incidental fees, security fees, and taxes.  The cost to stay here is only pennies lower than non-casino hotels.  Just another piece of information."
2,"OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...\n\nReview #10:\nway out east in Henderson; definitely catering to the locals & elderly, with miles & miles of slot machines, plus a huge bingo room, a 13-screen movie theater, and a massive 72-lane bowling alley; the kiddos are also accomodated with multiple arcades & an amusement rides area; the hotel portion is really set off to the side, so much so that I didn't even realize there were hotel rooms here initially; nice motif throughout the casino, especially the faux-balconies near the restaurants; they also have a very nice & quite large sports book that invites lingering; restaurant & bar choices are pretty basic, but the Oyster Bar is a cut above; overall, would have given them 3.5 stars if I could; best craft beer bet = the Oyster Bar for sure, which recently added about 10 good beers in bottles"
2,"One of the older station casinos I enjoy going to. It's close to my house which makes it a sought after place for gambling, eating or bowling. Parking never seems to be an issue since there are lots around the entire casino and a decent sized parking garage.\n\nThe eateries are nothing spectacular in my opinion. I have tried a few places but never returned with all of the other options in the area. I will find myself having a small bite in the \"" cafeteria \"" are with fast food options for a quick or to go meal.\n\nI mainly come here to play the slot or bingo from time to time. I like the layout of the slot machines and the fact that they are not right on top of one another. Being so close to where I live I will come back from time to time but I usually drive a little further to GVR for my local place to play."
2,"Overall this is a pretty good place. It's located off the strip so it seemed to be a more local crowd. We ate at the buffet which was very good as far as casino buffets go. It had a variety of food, all of which was pretty good. \n\nThe place also has a 72 lane bowling alley, arcade, and kid area."
1,"I came to the buffet for salad. They had spinach and good dressings.  I was pleased with my salad. Anything else on the buffet looked like it was 20 years old. Dry gross and gross.  However, the crowd didn't seem to be starving -- at all.  So no one missed a calorie and I guess all is well that ends well."
3,"Besides the gym, the mall is probably my second favorite place to get my exercise on. Well, that is before I sabotage it with carby goodness. The food court is filled with pitfalls waiting to snag it's next victim. Auntie Anne's would not be so bad until you see them brush a generous application of butter on top. \n\nWith such a critical opinion of their practice, why would I give them such a high rating? Sometimes counting calories and nitpicking is a buzz kill. The cinnamon sugar pretzel is the answer to a sweet tooth. The pepperoni twist is like having all crust with pieces of meat. Some of the more popular items are made ahead of time, but I was told it would take six minutes for mine. Maybe the pizza inspired bread does not sit well and I am glad to have it come out fresh."
0,"CLOSED!  AND THE BIG SLIDES REMOVED??\n\nNot sure what is going on here, looks to be some renovations I'll be totally bummed if they lose the big slides."
1,"In short I would REALLY like to shove my broken ass foot up this UMC's bungholio. Maybe I'm just brusque because I am in no better shape than I was before this visit. Nope, UMC just sucks.\n\nNo Radiologist on site to read my x-rays.....so who read them? Better yet, who did I pay to read them? Maybe it was the manager's daughter in her early 20s in a Walmart sundress who sounded like she was on Oxycontin and just smoked ten packs of cigs. I love when I am at these places and hear such random conversations I shouldn't be hearing. \n\n2nd. I can barely walk. Yes, it's my fault I'm such a clutz. The doctor says it's severly sprained and throws me a script for Tylenol with Codeine and has a nurse wrap my foot and tells me to go buy a cane or my own brace. WTF?! She also says it may be fractured, but I need to see a Podiatrist to find out for sure, oh and I can't workout for 8-10 weeks........Why did I come here again? Ughhh.\n\nThe TWO STARS is because this bullshit only took me a little over an hour and I was out. We all know that deserves stars. \n\nIf you happen to stumble into my office today I am the cranky one drooling with my swollen foot on the desk watching Facts of Life reruns not doing diddly and possibly sleeping.\n\nDO NOT WAKE THE DRAGON."
0,"I came into this office tonight for an abscess tooth. I have had a few so I know the difference. The pain is unbearable and your gums form a pocket after you have had a cavity for some while. I don't have insurance and I do not have 50 or would've went to a dentist. Let me add I came in for antibiotics, not hard core pills. Let me say this place is horrible! After claiming I have gingivitis from the female doctor on staff at 7:30 at night to not giving me a prescription  because I wouldn't pay 50 is basically holding it hostage. I could understand if I was trying to get Vicodin but an antibiotic? The lady in charge of billing kicked me out! I will be going to the director having a law background I know that UMC has a sign on the wall stating that they will help everyone. What they're forgot at the bottom is anyone with money. By the way already at another hospital and have been seen and what so you know I have an abscess tooth, not gingivitis. You will have to pay a copay if they find you as not an emergency, which gingivitis would be considered as not an emergency. The nurse there who has blonde hair I will be writing the director for her because she belongs in a way better environment. Gingivitis is where all your gums are inflamed and your gums are bleeding."
2,"I have eaten here a few times.  At first I really liked the place, but upon reflection I haven't really had anything great.  The portion sizes are huge and the prices are pretty good.  The combos plates offer a pretty good mix, and the chicken katsu and beef short ribs are pretty tasty.  I had the kalua pork once and it was too salty for my tastes.  I know it's Hawaiian BBQ-style food, but I always wish that whatever I ordered had come with some kind of vegetables.  Just eating meat, rice, and mac salad makes for a really heavy meal."
3,"For the price, it's not a bad deal. I got the wings today. 9 of them plus rice and a small amount of mac salad. I normally get the seafood combo. It comes with mahi mahi, teriyaki chicken, and shrimp. I always tell them to delete the shrimp and give an extra piece of fish. Normally the fish is thick, moist and good. Last time over cooked and dry. The teriyaki chicken always good. The shrimp always horrible. Don't get it. Too thin, too much bread, too dry. Step back from their shrimp. \nAll in all, the chicken always good and the mahi mahi most times good. Not great. But good, and enough of it."
0,"I will NEVER  go back!    The food is good, but over priced!\nThey charge you for drink refills, they charge you for togo containers.  The blinds are broken and nasty, the ceiling fans are nasty.  And then they have the nerve to post a sign no plate picking!  Give me a freaking break!  Make your place upscale , then maybe put a sign up like that!"
1,"I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster."
1,"I actually like coming to this location although they can get really busy and the wait times can be long. \nThe servers are friendly ... and who doesn't like to write on the table with a crayon?\nI really enjoy the eggplant parmesan or chicken parmesan- their salad is remarkable and fresh with a lighter dressing than that of Olive Garden.\nFor an Italian Chain Restaurant it is really good. \nThe decor is nice with cafe italian style look. \nDefinitely a fun place for a crowd... or an intimate dinner for TWO.\n\nOk Addendum to the above review : Went here last night on a date. He ordered Chicken Alfredo , I ordered Chicken Parm. I liked my dinner ... did not like the appetizer stuffed mushrooms... (crab is usually not that fishy tasting)\n\nAlso the salad had a funny taste.\n\nMy server was nice ... but he was more interested in flirting with my date than serving us. Also getting a refill on water... Good thing I wasn't dehydrated because ... i had to keep asking.\n\nHe did somewhat make up for it by filling a bag full of bread with our leftovers...\n\nWhatever!\n\nWon't be back for awhile!"
1,"I hate to give 1 star, so 2 will do. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here for dinner around 6:00 on a Sunday evening, it looked a little busy so the 10 minute wait for a booth sounded great! The manager apologized and I assured him we were fine with that.\n\n \nFirst, the poor hostess was so lost and confused,  she was wondering around looking so stressed out trying to help buss tables, looked like her first job. The busser was no where to be found I only saw him twice the whole night, it almost seemed as if he was washing dishes and didn't have time to buss. The whole night we sat with the last tables dirty cups and dishes stacked above our head at the booth.\n\nSecond, Our bartender was our server so I expected a little wait, no one brought us bread until we asked, and when brought out it was just thrown on the table, no oil was served or anything,  nobody even introduced themselves. Meanwhile,  our order went in at 6:20 at 6:50 our main dish was served, it looked as if it was sitting on the counter for 15 minutes and a little cold, but wasn't to big to complain so we just asked for some extra sauce to moist it back, by 7:10 the extra sauce was delivered as well as our appetizer salads... My boyfriend has order the chicken parmesan,  he asked for bowtie noodles and unfortunately got thick string noodles.\n\nHey my pinapple mojito was delicious!!\n\nFinally, our check was brought out our bartender apologized for the horrible service he knew was served and comped everything from our bill except  our salads, I was thankful.\n\nI wanted to add a server in particular,  unfortunately I do not know his name, but I made sure I went out of my way to thank him for everything because he was the one making sure we ordered, our food was delivered, our condiments were brought out, refilled waters, he basically did everything, defiantly the only one who could hold his composure at a busy rate."
1,"How you gonna call it Macaroni Grill and there isn't any macaroni on the menu, WTF?!? I mean the had deep fried macaroni bites but no macaroni & cheese entrees?!? Seriously?!? Very limited on the vegetarian choices too. The service wasn't bad, wasn't superb either. The only good thing is the two of us got full for $40."
4,"Service was great.  Chicken Parm.  was huge.  Great bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, yummy.  Wife had chicken fettuccine alfredo.  She was very happy with it. Good grilled chicken and the sauce was really fresh, clearly house made.  Good Caesar salads too.  Didn't have any wine.  Server advised that they have half price bottles of wine on Thursdays.  Might come back for that.  Kids liked there pasta and pizza too.  Pizza was really good sized.  Good fresh brewed iced tea too.  No complaints."
3,"I got a good haircut and style at a decent price. The girl did what i asked when i showed her a picture. Theres a special right now - 7 foil highlights,cut, dry, waxed brows all for $60!"
1,"This Borders closes very early compared to other stores and is always low on stock.  You can never find anybody to help you find something, but the line is short and the clearance section is nice.  The bathrooms are so-so.  The music selection is great and so are the DVDs."
1,I used to enjoy the store because they had the best newsstand in the area. I don't know what happened but that is no longer the case. There are a lot of empty spaces and the magazines that are there are out of order. The newsstand is practically unshoppable. It's sad when I can go across the street to Target and get a better selection and more up to date selection of magazines. \n\nIn addition to the poor state of the newsstand they no longer carry music and DVDs. It is also difficult to locate new book releases. You are better off going around the corner to Barnes & Noble.
2,"I got my oil changed in 30 minutes.  It was quick, painless, and I wasn't \""hussled\"".  They mentioned I would want to replace something but they didn't try and force me to do it then and there.  I also got my oil change through groupon so it was nice to see a big company like Midas giving out discounts!"
4,"Love it.  I wish there was one closer to where I live, but rumor has it they are opening up on Eastern @ Horizon Ridge in September. I can't wait.\n\nThey have great prices on everyday cheese, tp & energy bars.\n\nI also love all of their seasoned nuts.  Yummm."
4,"This was my first time stepping foot in a trader joes and it's pretty weird for me. I'm just unfamiliar with a lot of their products and all the organic, grass fed, & natural products. \n\nI'm all about being healthy tho so it's just right I come back and actually shop intensively. For they do offer a lot of things that sparks my interest. \nPlus, all natural, grass fed, bone in ribeye. I will cook n taste u soon!"
0,"I had my excursion detailed here for $65 (Dec 2, 2010). It took them over 2 hours and when I got it back it had dirty patches all over.  Especially in the door jams.  But what is worse, that night the truck was stolen from right in front of my house!  The police and insurance both tell me that car wash staff look for certain cars and when they spot one they want- all they need to do is look at your registration for your address. Further, In the 2 hours they had my car it would even possible for them to create a duplicate key and transponder.  If I had another car, I'd never take it back there again!"
0,"No longer a hand car wash place. I had to drive my own car through. (Guess I have to try the 7 Hills hand car wash place.) This place still has great greeting cards, though!"
0,"Not good.\n\nFirst, beware of the scammer who's gonna greet you and ask you if you were interested in fixing \""the chips' on your windshield.\n\nThen, are you interested in paying +$15 for a car wash that doesn't bother cleaning your cup holder or empty your car's ashtray?\n\nLastly, even their express car wash machine is terrible. It left deep scratches and swirls on my car.\n\nThe owners should save their dignity and close this place or consider giving customers better service."
0,"Brought my dogs in here twice. First time I brought my dogs in to stay here for a week, when I picked them up one was limping. Ok whatever stuff happens.  Brought them in a second time for another week a few months later. One of them was limping again and eye was kinda wonky and shut as if had been kicked.  I am never bringing my dogs back here again. I Do not trust these people at all."
1,"I was fooled by the reviews. This was my first time ever going to a laundromat, and from the reviews, this placed seems like they would help me figure it out. \nWell,  I took my comforter in to wash today and the lady working was overly rude when I asked her questions. And if I didn't catch it the first time, she started speaking to me in a slow, degrading manner. She also told me I needed the biggest, $6 washer, which was probably actually a little excessive, but oh well. \nAlso, well over half of the machines are out of order. And the place isn't very clean for a laundry facility. \nMaybe I just didn't come when the right employees were working, but these other reviews had my expectations a lot higher than they should have been."
3,"This is one of the better Barnes and Noble locations in town, not to mention the closest to this reviewer's house. And unlike that one on Rainbow, this one DOES have a video section.\n\nBarnes and Noble carries all things books. Be it reference, works of fiction, periodicals, there is a little bit of everything here. Any subject you could possibly want a book on, there is a good bet you'll find something in here. \n\nThe video section is top-notch selection-wise, but their prices are considerably higher than big box stores. They make up for this with a good selection of obscure titles, but you might just want to go to Zia for that stuff. Still, every now and then they DO have good sales in this department.\n\nAdditionally, there is a small section featuring board games and the like, basically things that can make good gifts. A Starbucks Coffee location is featured here as well, complete with outdoor patio area.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't had to ask the employees for much in here. But when I do have a question, they are generally attentive and help me quickly. I haven't had a problem with any member of their staff, ever. \n\nThe major complaint I have with the store is that they move stuff around every few months. The way I see it, if the store layout ain't broken, don't fix it! This makes it a huge hassle to find what you're looking for if they have just done a renovation. Additionally, their frequent buyer program must be paid for, whereas the one at Borders is free. \n\nAll in all this is a top-notch bookstore, I just wish they had better prices on their (not on sale) movies and that they wouldn't move stuff around so often. The store gets a firm recommendation though."
1,"I love books. I love bookstores. I do not own a kindle or a nook. So i tend to buy real books. The kind made from paper. It is rare though that i get a chance to stop by the bookstore. I wasn't missing anything except a future bodily injury just for standing in the wrong spot. \nI could see that this store was changing the layout of some sections. They were adding a toy section. So\nI guess i don't understand the older gentleman wheeling around a dolly and nearly running over my two year old, twice. No pardon me. No excuse me. Sir i know you are older, so i am sure that manners were around when you were a child. I like browsing \ni do\nNot like almost being ran over!!!!!! There is not an angry mob of early Christmas shoppers just waiting for you and your magic, kid smashing dolly to get all of the holiday crap set up in OCTOBER. Rude. I felt like i was in his way.\n Guess some people don't care about the real human shoppers. I did spend over $100 picking up a few books. The girl that rang us up was less than friendly. Asked if i had a membership card. I said no. That was that. No offer to get a membership. Just a buy my crap and leave attitude.  I believe this is the only bookstore in Henderson now. Love the selection. Guess i will stick to Amazon from now on though. At least I am not in anyone's way while I shop online. The people working there should be a bit more nice to\nShoppers. I could care less about your Christmas set up. Hope you guys got done with whatever it was in time though. Seemed like an emergency. One important enough that you shit on the customers. Me. I spend a TON on books. But seriously am just soooooooo\nOver rude ass store employees. Dont they teach you to be nice or maybe to drive the dolly down another path in customer service 101. Guess going around me would have taken up\nToo\nMuch chritmas display set up time. Those star wars bobbleheads are not going to  set themselves up. Gotta please the angry mob."
0,The worst customer experience we have ever received! My family and I were going to purchase some new books like we have done many times before but the way we were treated by a B&N employee (older women wearing glasses) was anything but family friendly! If you're a miserable person please refrain from dealing with the public. Looks like Amazon will have to be my new book source.
4,"I donate blood here 3-4 times a year. The staff is always attentive and pleasant, and they make sure you are comfortable. They've always been well staffed so I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes in the waiting area. They are very well stocked with post-donation goodies: a great assortment of juices, water, and cookies. Donating blood is easy and pretty painless, and it saves lives. Plus afterwards you get to take it easy the rest of the day, and make your next meal a hearty one :)"
3,"No complaints about the quality of the haircut, but during my fourth visit, the barber (Bob) cutting my hair started negotiating price about halfway through the haircut.  Their standard price for a haircut is $15, and on my previous visits I've given him a $5 tip.  He said that haircuts \""like mine\"" are extra work (I have thick hair, which requires using thinning shears), and he feels that I should pay $25 (!) for all the \""extra work\"".  In over 40 years, I have *never* had a barber complain about my hair being hard to cut.  If he had said this up front, I would have walked out, but I couldn't really leave in the middle of a haircut.  Needless to say, I will be exploring other options in the future.\n\nUPDATE - I complained to the owner (Ernie), and he was very eager to make things right.  He said to come back next time and ask for him, and the haircut would be on the house.  I did, and was quite pleased with the result.  After a number of repeat visits over a period of a couple years (until I moved away), I would not hesitate to recommend this place - just avoid Bob (the old guy in the far back)."
2,"I have gone here several times only b/c it is close to my house and they have good beer on tap and well my team won everytime I watched my games there.. Superstition has never been my deal but.. this year when the Cowboys were winning in December I didnt want to break forumula & chance the lost. Strangely the 1st wknd I didnt watch the game there we lost. (coincidence, who knows..)\nOne thing I have to mention, some of the waitresses are nice, some are not. Some take shots while on the clock and spend too much time flirting, and not serving.... That's $ that their business is losing out on. \n2nd..the ladies bathroom has the worst sewer stench I've ever smelled. OMG It smells the same way everytime you walk in there. I even tried to manually press the air fresheners and they wouldnt work. I'd really like to see the restaurant improve some to these things. The avacado bacon burger was pretty good -minus the burnt charred sections of the outside of the patty. the Stromboli was delicious. The calzone is tasty and the wings are pretty good, the hot isnt really hot but pretty good texture wise. Not too saucy and not too dry, just right.  Will I go back, certainly. (more for the bar scene than the restaurant. )"
2,I just stopped by and the premises were sealed by an eviction order dated 15 June---but then next to it was an order to stay the eviction dated 21 June.  The door was still chained.
0,"Most forgetful server ever! It must have been his first night ever.... he forgot the extra plate, the extra side, chips n salsa, and most bothersome....... our drinks!!!!!! We were eating our meals and our drinks had still not arrived. And our food was spicy so we were in dire need of a drink.... then at the end he brings the bill and forgets to add the coupon we already gave him."
0,Guacamole is made at the table half assed server is rushed and unpleasant. If  I wanted shitty guacamole I could of made it at home for alot cheaper very disappointed I will never go back and it was super expensive for shitty guacamole
2,"I am not a good golfer, so it's not entirely my place yet to judge a course's quality.  This is one of the few affordable places for a local to golf without having to drive outside of town, so that makes it attractive.  Even without being on top of my game though, I would tell that the fairways (when I was actually on them) were a little thin and sandy.  The greens (after the 10 shots it took me to get to them) were hard, thin and fast.  I would blame my extremely high score on the course, but I'm quite certain that my horrible skill level had something to do with that.  It was a fine course for it's age, and not entirely unreasonable comparably in Las Vegas.  The golf shop people were friendly, the concessions girl was helpful, and the restaurant was quite good.  I would say something nice about the bev cart, but we only saw it twice in 18 holes.  I think that's not quite often enough."
4,We were at the Wildhorse for a fundraiser a few weeks back. The course was in phenomenal shape and the team running the Wildhorse was up to par! We had massive requests in which all were fulfilled with a group of 400. A great place to attend a round or organize an event

1,"I took my wife's 2000 Chrysler LHS to this place for an oil change on Tuesday, September 9th, 2014.  No problems, however they informed me that her water pump had a leak.  It did, and after the leaky part was replaced the next day on Wednesday September 10th, and showed to me, I was satisfied with the work, and paid the $727.00.  However, within 25-30 miles of driving, the coolant began leaking severely, by mid-day, Thursday September 11th.  Alarmed with the timing, since my wife takes impeccable care of her car, and since the coolant had never leaked before, and since the container where the coolant gets poured, was less than one year old and installed by a dealership, I took the car right back to the repair center within 10 minutes of my wife telling me there was now a coolant leak.  I was told by the manager at the Purrfect facility that it is possible to put too much coolant in this car, and that was the problem, and they just needed to remove some.  This was after the leak had started, and this explanation was given to me after four of these guys put the car up on the rack and looked at it with flashlights, with their faces 6 inches from the system.  I watched them do this, and was also walked out there, and the hose where they said the leak was coming from, was pointed out to me.  Anyone who fixes these cars, is supposed to know that this cooling system is pressurized.  The leaky water pump was causing the coolant system to run at less pressure than normal, all summer, and then as soon as the leak was fixed, and optimal pressure was achieved, it immediately caused a crack in the container where you pour the coolant into this car.  The change back to normal pressure was too sudden for the integrity of the coolant bottle.  The Purrfect guys completely missed this crack, incorrectly identified the source of the leak, and gave an explanation, that since, I have re-told to three more garages in three different states, a Chrysler dealership in my hometown, another Purrfect location in Las Vegas, and a Napa repair center, and they all have said the same thing, that the too much coolant explanation is a complete B.S., nonsense explanation.  The Purrfect manager told us the car would be fine, and my wife and I drove it to San Diego on Friday, September 12th, to see her family for her baby shower, because she is 7 weeks from giving birth to our first child.  The first time we stopped for gas in Barstow, and turned off the car, the coolant leaked out all over the ground.  We put a little more in, but barely made it the rest of the way.  During the trip I called the Purrfect place back, and the young man that answers the phone said that everything would be fine, there was still just a little excess coolant in there, and the temperature would not be an issue.  We made it to San Diego running the heater at full blast with the windows down, and at midnight, finally had to pull over on Interstate 5, in Carlsbad, and had to have AAA town the car to my father-in-law's preferred repair center, because the engine temperature gauge was approaching the red zone, and it normally is just below the middle.  By 5pm on Saturday, September 13th, my father-in-law's guys had caught the crack in the coolant bottle, replaced it, gave the correct explanation, and since then, the car has run perfectly, and cruised all the way back to Vegas from San Diego on Sunday, September 14th, with not even so much as a rattle.  My basic 10th grade knowledge if the ideal gas law, is how I smelled a rat after that too much coolant explanation, however, my benefit of the doubt initially, with these guys, caused me to be stranded on the side of an interstate after midnight, with a wife a few weeks into her 3rd trimester of pregnancy, 300 miles from home, and caused me to be at a repair center rather than my wife's first, and possibly only, baby shower.  Thank God I have AAA, and thank God I paid attention in chemistry class, because these guys obviously didn't.  The only two contact numbers listed for this company on the website, also, are not valid.  They are dead ends."
2,This place beats Taco Bell in the face with a baseball bat. I have a guilty love for Del Taco and I come in whenever I'm in a hurry or on a road trip. The fish tacos are delicious and truly rival some of the ones I've had from real Mexican places. The other favorite menu item is the Big Fat Steak tacos. They're wrapped in a pita and come with a spicy white sauce and finely shredded cheddar.
4,Extremely courteous and expedient. Fixed my tire for no charge. A+
4,"These people have had my business for quite awhile now and they will continue to receive all my business.  From greeting you at the door with a bottle of water to the quickness of service, they excel above all others.  I recommend this place to all."
4,"My favorite place to eat in all of LAS VEGAS...! Hands down...\n\nReasons:\nCustomer service is superb.  I have been in Vegas for over two years now, visited this place at least over 2 dozen times but have nothing bad to say about it.  \n\nI love love the Korean Chicken Teriyaki rice bowl..its under four bucks, you get a good amount of rice and chicken.  The sauce is different then your normal Teriyaki sauce at other places. I've asked for extra sauce so many time, pretty much with every order...They give without charging an extra penny. \n\nI've recently tried their normal teri chicken rice bowl, also the same price but the sauce is less salty.  Feel in love all over again.  I don't know how this place stays in business charging as they do, but I think because its family own, quite affordable that the locals always comes back for more, keeping this awesome hole in the wall in business.  \n\nTheir spam masubi is 1.50, spam is decent in size and enough for a good filling snack.  :) \n\nI think what put it over the top for me was last night.  I order my usual, the chicken teri bowl on the phone,  but when i came to pick it up, their person who took my order thought i order the actually plate which was two times the price, I make it known to Matt, and he, without hesitation, gave me my food charging me for the rice bowl and extra side of chicken.  (I also tipped a few bucks for the nice service)  When i opened it, the size of my order was not the bowl but the plate.  I was amazed at the customer service this place continuous to reflect.  I called Matt to say thanks once again.  \n\n\nNo reason to not try this place if you haven't been in before, its worth the time, the drive and the room you have in your belly! :)"
4,"Never disappointed eating here. Friendly service, hot and fantastic tasting food.  I especially like the spicy chicken bowl.  You can have it with a fountain drink for under $6, what a bargain.\nI want to try their breakfast one day."
0,Ordered the roast pork menehune. Looked like TV dinner.  Not coming back. The Siamin was horrible.
4,Very friendly staff. Little to no wait time. Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing. Very easy to work with.
0,"Poor customer service, especially on the phone. I know it's Home Depot, but the least you could do is introduce yourself when you pick up a phone call instead of just saying, \""hullo.\"" And don't respond with \""yeah, of course!\"" when we ask you if it's Home Depot because you didn't tell us where we were calling in the first place."
1,"Just came here looking for an extension for our outdoor misters. They had one left if the item we were looking for but when we opened the box (in the store) to make sure all the parts were there, the box was missing nozzles, connectors, and someone had switched out the tubing. We told the worker that was helping us about it and they took it. When we were leaving the guy put it right back on the shelf! So some poor sucker who doesn't have the sense to open the box is going to end up buying it"
1,"Let's see, I could probably say one associate took genuine interest in my concern, and I am terrible for not knowing his name, so to the slender man with the long hair! Thank you for that. I ordered something online that came to my apartment in my name and because it was a gift I was a little surprised, nonetheless, I opened it, the box was beautiful, but where was the gift message? Oh I don't know, perhaps typed on top of the receipt. Really unattractive, I went to the store just to inquire on how deliveries were, and was told that a separate card should have arrived. Ok, that's fine but I just shared that I was disappointed that it came this way because had it been opened by that person it would have been sad. Moving on, I leave to find out if things remembered engraved the tiny thing, no, so I go back to ask if they do, a different associate helps me and I wondered if she even considered that perhaps this had any importance to me... She dropped the pendant and I said \""wow dropping it\"" she grabs it off the table and says to me, \""sorry, angel\"" in a condescending tone...  My gift was an angel pendant. \n#thumbsup\nThe manager shakes her head both times I was there when the associates had to ask her something, did she try to find ways to help? Nope, an upsale could have happened there, thanks for the outstanding customer service zales! I really enjoyed my experience.\n\n#sarcasm"
3,"Honestly, wings are probably my favorite food on the planet. I'll get them any way I can. BWW always has good variety and plays just about every sporting event known to man, which makes this place all the better for me. I'll be spending a lot of time here during football season. My new love is the Thai curry."
1,"I do not know what it is with all of the restaurants on Mall Ring Circle in Henderson, but they all suck!   This is the third time I've been in this BW3, and it keeps getting worse.  My server today (at the bar) was nice enough, but it took 30 minutes to get one order of 8 traditional wings.  And then, they're going to charge me an extra 60 cents for some ranch to dip them in?!  They NEVER have enough staff.  The person I had today was friendly enough, but most of them in there, look like they work in the worst place on earth.  And God forbid you ask for a game on a certain TV (even when it's slow) and they act like it's a chore.  It's a shame, because the location on Warm Springs and Durango is great.  This location could definitely use a refresher course in customer service from them.  I am done with this location.  And I am done with ALL of the restaurants on Mall Ring Circle."
1,"I never write reviews but this made me upset enough to write one. We arrived for a quick dinner but waited over 30 minutes for our order to get to us (which was two small orders of wings). Our waitress was horrible, she was late getting our order to the kitchen so two groups of people that were seated 5 and 10 minutes after us got their food before us. Then one of the wing flavors arrived wrong, I asked the order be cancelled. One of the managers arrived and said that our order would be cancelled (she did NOT offer any discount). I told the manager what happened and she said that food is served in the order it reaches the kitchen. That basically told me that our waitress slacked off. We asked our waitress to call the other manager over , she first stopped and talked to some of her coworkers never getting the manager. We had to get the other manager ourselves (AJ was his name) he was actually understanding and helpful. I like Buffalo Wild Wings but this experience has changed that."
0,Bugs in my salad and vomit in the bathroom urinal. After showing the manager the chef came out and half ass apologized and said he's seen worse. Clearly they have high standards...
1,"This place is what it is.. large selection of obviously use items. You'd thibk they would at least give the shelves a dust off every once in a while. Large selection of furniture, that's mainly what I was looking at, but of you want to sell a coffee table for $50 at least try and clean it and touch up the corners that have scratches, cuz I'm sure I could find something brand new on craigslist or online for same price or a little more.\n\nThis is my first time in here but they had a calendar on the front door saying different discounts for the week and Tuesday happened to be today for military,student,employees and a couple other things (but can't remember). The discount I believe each day was 25% off."
0,I would much rather give this place zero stars. I scheduled a pick up and they sent me a window when they would be there and no one showed up. However I got a call saying he's running. A few Minutes behind I can understand. Here I am not calling customer service talked to 3 diff people aside from the guy Jason who called me the last guy then told me that the driver just went back to the warehouse then left and the best the could schedule me for was 2 weeks from now. Annoying. Never going to them again now that I sat at an empty apartment and wasted 7 hours of my day waiting for them.
0,"Sorry - an employee can definitely ruin it for me! I used to take my girls into the Sweet Factory at Galleria Mall about once a month. They each have a fave candy so I let them get 1/4 pound each and it lasts them for days. \n\nNORMALLY, the employees are VERY sweet and helpful. They smile, converse, offer samples, recommend items, etc.\n\nLast Saturday, my girls begged to go to the mall just to visit the Sweet Factory. I agreed, as it had been a long time since they had eaten candy.\n\nWe walked inside and were IGNORED by the new, young girl at the register. My youngest (age 5) even ran up to her and said, \""Hi! We are going to buy candy today\""! \nShe STARED at my child and ignored her. I became irritated but I let it go. \n\nWe grabbed our candy and went to the register to pay. She seemed irritated that we were in the store. (We did NOTHING wrong, we were quiet and quick).\n\nAs we were at the register, I noticed a more regular employee, an older woman (older than the girl at the register) and the girl suddenly perked up and GREETED the next customers who came in. \n\nIt became GLARINGLY OBVIOUS that the young employee was only being \""nice\"" when her boss was around. The older woman went into the back and we continued to pay. She proceeded to say NOTHING to us, not even \""thank you\"" when she handed over the bag.\n\nThe only time she seemed alert was when the other woman was around.\n\nAs we excited the store, I was MAD. She was rude, pure and simple. I made a comment to my husband her rudeness. \n\nAt the same time, another customer (a man and his young son) approached us. He was behind us in line. He asked, \""Was she as rude to you as she was to us?\""\n\nI wanted to call the store and complain about her but I felt like giving her the benefit of the doubt. But the more I think about how FAKE she was around her boss and RUDE to my children, I'm over it. We are not going back."
0,"Walked out. An hour wait no food and a rude waitress. This used to be a good place. They removed the bar,put a bunch of tables. Now it feels like a cafeteria will not go back! People sat after us, received their food, ate, paid and left and we hadn't received our food."
1,"When I heard my manager said he was going to \""treat himself\"" by going out to Blueberry Hill, I almost fell over in my chair. I mean, has he seen my other review of Blueberry Hill on Flamingo? Abhorrent! Wretched! This is a treat I would give to a used car salesman. Or Satan. Or someone else who's bad.\n\nNay nay, says he, you have to go to the one on Green Valley Parkway. It's 10,000 times better. I responded with a hearty \""meh\"" and went back to work.\n\nToday, however, I needed something to get the creative juices flowing, so I figured why not put Mr. Manager's words to the test. I got to the Blueberry Hill on Green Valley Parkway, and was promptly greeted and sat. In order to be most fair, I ordered exactly the same thing as I did at the last Blueberry Hill: Mexican-style chilaquiles and a Diet Pepsi. It was the same plate of mediocrity as the other one. I don't see how people rave about these places when I always seem to get plates full of mediocre.\n\nOn the upside, the service was a little faster. Not that much more friendly, but at least I wasn't waiting forever to get a refill on soda.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm still not sold on these places. If I need comfort food ASAP, I'm sticking with Denny's."
4,"The only thing that I can say is YUM! I love the pancakes, the waffles and the service."
3,"Clean place, friendly staff. The only negative thing I can say about the place is they typically have 1-2 printers down."
4,"Other quick-mex places charge you for adding fajita veggies, or extra salsa on the side, but Chipotle lets you ask for extra of almost any ingredient for free (*not double meat or guac.)  The portions are huge and the whole \""ethics of food\"" marketing is terrific.  When in doubt, I will happily eat here any time, with any number of friends.  :-)"
4,Best place to get a reasonably-priced meal with the freshest ingredients. The place is always clean and the staff very friendly and helpful.
3,"I don't crave Mexican food very often at all, but I think Chipotle is a great fast to-go place when you're just wanting a good taco, salad, or burrito.\n\nI was impressed that despite the growing lunch line forming, the employees at the counter assisted the customers very quickly! I was ordering and had my food in hand within minutes. \n\nWe had the steak salad and taco. Can't complain, it was tasty, custom-made with all your choice of fixings, and wrapped up ready to go. \n\nA good choice for lunch, I'd say..."
0,"I am so upset and disappointed with Chipotle across from Sunset Station on Sunset Road. At 1:45pm 6/24/12, a husky latino young man, gave me the WORST service ever! I ordered a bowl with vegetables and steak, of which they apparently were running out. I get a significantly smaller portion than what I usually get at your restaurant. When I asked for more veggies to supplement the lack of both steak and veggies, the attendant said we are out; I said I would wait; he throws the plate away with an attitude and a dirty look, with no intention of giving me what I asked for. I had to spend my money at Spicy Pickle to get the food and service I deserve"
0,"While perusing I saw this Chipotle and thought I'd share my experience.  I ate here once many years ago and was underwhelmed and wondered why anyone LOVED Chipotle.  Fast forward to last year and I had never eaten at Chipotle again thinking \""gross\""...the more is more concept of globbing tons of food into a burrito that was not dispersed properly and had dried out beans and chicken and charged extra for chips and salsa.  Never ate at a Chipotle again.  Then a year or so ago, I had a weekly meeting and always needed dinner and the only place on the road to my meeting was a Chipotle, so I had NO CHOICE but to eat there.  Well, it was delicious!  So delicious in fact that I ate there 4 weeks in a row and couldn't wait to get there.  \n\nSo I finally go back to my Chipotle in my neighborhood and think I have been missing out all these years.  Nope, still dried out, bland beans and chicken.  This location needs some management intervention because I am now addicted to Chipotle, but not this location."
0,"I can honestly say I have never been so dissatisfied with the customer service of a restaurant as I did with Chipotle. Not only was their service an extreme inconvenience, it was just plain rude. While I was there, the works decided to say each other's names in what sounded like a song. This annoying activity dragged on for quite some time. It continued as I tried to order, and the person serving me decided that it would be a good idea to join in on their singing festivities rather than serving me. They cut me off when I was trying to order and then she ended up getting my order entirely wrong. The burrito I received was tasteless and probably one of the worst things I've ever eaten. It is because of this failure to serve me probably that I did not enjoy my experience and I have not returned since. I cannot believe the workers still have their jobs after being so incredibly disrespectful."
4,"Best gyros I have ever had.  \""thumbs up\"""
2,"I wanted to give this place more stars because of the service. Honestly, its pretty impressive how nice they are considering that they are located in a mall food court and have to deal with rude, hurried shoppers all the time. They were very courteous about my groupon and explained the different pitas they offered over the phone while i placed a carryout order. Service wise, these guys were top notch-- very accommodating, very patient, very polite.\n\nI ordered two of their original gyros, a chicken fajita gyro, and an ultimate chicken gyro which came with feta cheese and lettuce. It's definitely not bad. Their gyros are packed with meat. You honestly shouldn't be ordering fries if you are already getting one of their wraps-- it's surprisingly filling. The quality of the meat was so-so. Better than your average fast food style gyro-- the meat seemed to be more thickly sliced. (Don't ever buy a gyro at a place that doesn't explicitly specialize in middle eastern or Greek cuisine) However,  I think you're better off eating the gyros at nearby Greek Bistro. They added sliced tomatoes--pretty standard stuff. The bread was ok, thick but I would have preferred something that wrapped a bit better. But ultimately, the sauce just didn't impress me that much. I was expecting more of an authentic, cucumber based hint to it and it didn't taste much different from standard plain yogurt. Not saying that it WAS yogurt-- I really don't know what it was. But it didn't impress me.\n\nThe specialty gyros we tried were decent. The fajita style gyro is definitely different. They used what tasted like yellow american cheese and grilled bell peppers and onions. A tasty alternative to a chicken burrito you might find at your average fast food mexican place. But just ok. The ultimate greek chicken did have that tasty feta cheese in it but it didn't blow me away. The chicken was plentiful but could have been juicer. I think it would have been preferable if they had used chicken kabob instead of sliced bits of chicken breast. \n\nAt no point during the eating of the aforementioned products did I think this place was bad or regret my purchase. At the same time, there was no point at which I found myself moaning in delight over the flavors. These guys are probably a good bet if you find yourself in the mall food court, but I otherwise wouldn't recommend them as an outing when there are noticeably better greek places nearby in Henderson. Despite my lukewarm review, I WOULD come back here again in the future, but probably only with another groupon, or to try some of their dessert options."
0,"Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered."
0,"If I could give this place a negative rating I would. My wife, 4 year old daughter and myself stopped in for lunch expecting a nice lunch. Well, as we all know they play Latin music in their establishments. On this particular day they decided to play whatever they wanted. While eating I noticed that there were F-bombs ad S-bombs being played over the speakers. I asked for the manager to complain and he gave me some excuse that they have no control over the music. BULL SHIT!! I asked for the corporate number and gave them a call. Turns out they have assigned stations that are to be played.\n  I have no complaint about Baja itself, I do have an issue with this location. AND for the little sharpy eye brow wearing Mexican bitch. Who the hell are you to tell my wife that my daughter doesn't look like here? you might want to keep you papers near by just incase a few of my INS buddies decide to stop by for lunch."
2,"I was really hoping to order one of my favorite salads but since we were at a different location, different menu items. Not everything was different, but it forced me to try something new, which wasn't bad. \n\nI ordered a Thai Chicken Salad (I think) which was really good and my boyfriend order a hawaiian pizza with sausage and jalape\u00f1os. We both enjoyed our food very much.\n\nThe strange thing was the service. It was kind of on the bad side. There were probably 4 groups outside (including us) and 2 inside, so it wasn't very busy. And we waited a long time to get our waters, get our food, refills, and our bill at the end, we became impatient and got up and handed our waiter the bill as we were leaving. Eh. They were nice, but slow.\n\nLuckily the food tasted good."
3,Fat salad is a fat ripoff.   So is 2.50 for a drink
1,"Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty. The only thing that made it worth while was the shake, still one of my favorite fast food shakes and probably the only thing I will return to get."
1,"Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses."
0,I have to say I really am disappointed in Sport Chalet.  There are few stores who have bad customer service as well as just a messy store.  \n\nWe went in looking for a few camping items.  The store was messy and a little more than a tad disorganized.  It wasn't cheap either.  Really no sales or discounts at all. \n\nMy comment about customer service?  We tried to find someone to help us with a question in the camping section and found no one in the store except up at the front of the store where there were 3 people just standing around talking and joking with each other.  The check out line was 5 deep with one person doing check outs.  The 3 standing there just didn't really seem to care nor want to help anyone. \n\nThis place is a no go for me to go back.
1,"It started out really well. Was seated in less than 10 minutes and our server started out great, but it went downhill from there. \nThe food was great but they forgot our appetizer. Trying to find our server was impossible. Had to keep asking for refills n they forgot to bring out the dessert for my friends bday. When it came to paying the check....once again had to find the server. Keep in mind it wasn't that busy.  Got the busboy to finally take our check. Maybe ill just try another location."
1,"I honestly do not understand the popularity of this place. It's a chain, nothing is cooked up by someones Great Grandma with a secret recipe.\n The Salad and breadsticks are fine. The food seems to be mostly heated up frozen chicken patties etc. Can't I just go to Costco and get the same stuff???\n The pasta is a joke ( seriously how cheap can you get? Pasta is what 99 cents a pound!?) . We ordered Chicken Parm and thought the pasta portion was hysterical for the price. Mainly because a real old school Italian place will give you enough to share with family or just take home. So to us it was pricey for 12.00 or whatever it cost.\n The waiter was fabulous, he was really on top of things. The atmosphere was great, the seats are uncomfortable.\n What Olive Garden has is an A+ in marketing. They stuff you full of a simple salad, and bread so you won't notice dinner is kind of a rip off. The salad bowl is shaped a certain way to make it look huge, all kinds of stuff like that. I have to hand it to them though they are a total genius at making people thrilled over very little. For the Olive Garden fans glad you enjoy it, but it just does nothing for me. Admittedly I was spoiled by old school Italian cooking from my Grandfather."
1,All I can say to sum it up is long! I got here around 7:45 and it's 10:00 and I'm still here. Not to mention that the waitress/waiter (and yes we had a multiple of servers) did not attend to us. People that got there an hour after me received their food before I.
1,"There are only 2 reasons I come here - okay, one big reason - Shellane! She is the best hair stylist I have ever had. I have never once had to bring a picture of what I want. During our first appointment she asked me a lot of questions about my morning routine, did I use product or not? Do I want to use product? How much time do I have to spend on my hair? etc. She then created this gorgeous look that I was able to recreate perfectly again and again afterwards. Every time I see her, I am soooo happy  with the results - she gets me. She is very hard to book, so if you are lucky enough to get her - make sure you book your next appointment right away and don't miss it (more on that later)!\n\nThat being said, this isn't a review on Shellane, it's a review of Ulta. This particular Ulta's customer service SUCKS! When you call the salon nobody EVER answers. I tried at least 5 times over a couple of weeks to book my appointment and nobody ever answered the phone. So I went in-store to book my appointment with Shellane. I waited for 5 minutes at the counter and nobody came to help me. I figured maybe the receptionist got pulled away for a minute, so I walked around the store for a few other items I needed. I came back, waited another 5 minutes and still nobody showed up. I had to go to the front counter and complain to get someone to help me. \n\nI missed one appointment with Shellane and it took me a month and a half to reschedule (after trying to call several times and going in-store I finally got an appointment). \n\nAlso, there is nobody on the floor to help you shop for products and if you're lucky enough to catch someone as they're speed walking from the front to the back, they have no knowledge of the products!\n\nHonestly, if Shellane wasn't the best hairdresser I've ever had - I would have started shopping elsewhere months ago! \n\nOh and if you're wondering what the second reason was - They (meaning corporate Ulta) have a pretty cool rewards program."
1,"Register service was not pleasant. I'm not sure if the girl who rang me up just didn't like me, but she was nice to everyone else until I got up to her."
3,"Being a fan of the $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe, which comes out to $3.87 when I upsize to medium, I made it a lunch stop. It served its purpose by filling me up at an inexpensive price.\n   On my visit here, the service was fine. The restaurant was also clean."
4,Stevie at the print/copy shop is awesome! She bend over backwards to help me and got me out of there quickly with exactly what I wanted at a price I fully expected.
1,"Stopped going to the Sunset road location in Las Vegas about a a year ago because food was not good anymore. When the new one opened up on Stephanie St In Henderson, we'd thought we'd give it one more shot. BIG MISTAKE! Steaks were not cooked as ordered, even when cooked a second time. Service wasn't the best either. Only thing good was the bread & salmon. Big disappointment Outback....."
0,"Why can't establishments higher qualified employees?  This is by far the worst experience at an Outback I've ever had!  Went to eat dinner early at 3pm on 9/21 (Sun.)  Our waitress Melanie A. is the worst most miserable server I've ever seen!  She was so rude and unfriendly....I was almost waiting for the hidden cameras to come out and say it was a joke!  We had the steak and all you can eat shrimp.  What a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!  Save your money and go to a buffet!  The steak was like shoe leather.  We ordered it Medium rare and it was Well Done and about 3 bites!  Both our baked potatoes were only half cooked!  The shrimp with garlic/herb was so disgusting that I can't even express it enough!  It was like salty mushy shrimp you buy in a can!!!!  It was not even edible!!!!  So we changed it to the fried shrimp.....after waiting 20 minutes for our server to be seen!  I still can't get over how rude she was!  Finally after 35 minutes we get 6 small fried shrimp in a dish!  Wow!!!! Don't hurt yourself Outback!!!!!  Usually \""fried shrimp\"" come with cocktail sauce.....but nope!  Our server Melanie A. didn't bother bringing us any!  I am floored that they can hire such incompetent people to run this place and think it will succeed!  I can tell you that we will never be back here again!  I use to go to the Outback in Detroit.....and it was excellent every single time I went!  So I have to assume it's the people running it in Henderson....that will run it in the ground.  The quality and quantity of the food in Henderson is pathetic!  And almost $4 for a soda?  Are you kidding me?  And NO REFILLS?  You can go to any crappy buffet in this town and get way better food and service!  This place is an over priced joke!!!!!!!  Oh and before I forget!!!!!  The bathrooms were filthy and the floors in the restaurant were horrific!!!!  This place needs to shape up bigtime or ship the hell out!!!!!!"
1,Hair in my salad. No refills. Didn't ask how my food was or how my steak was cooked. Unpleasant waitress. Need I say more?
4,"If you're looking for a great, casual but fun and friendly place, you've come to the right place. The owner, Rick, is generally there and loves to talk to the patrons. The pizza, hands-down, is one of the best in the entire city - thin crust is excellent! You have gaming machines at the bar, a juke-box, and t.v.'s. There will be KARAOKE on Sunday night's starting on 4/22/2012 at 8:00pm. The bar tenders are trying to bring some extra fun by having movie nights!"
0,"Really poor service, I fixed an appointment for test driving 2 cars. After being made to wait for over 90 minutes, they informed me that one of the cars has been sold and the other one cannot be found. Worst experience ever"
0,"Where do i even began, I would recommend  for no one to purchase any vehicle from ANY CarMax! I purchased a car from them and I believe it came with mechanical issues and of course CarMax in my opinion did not try to fix the issue they just brushed it off. The worst part about it is the car salesman that sold me this vehicle after me calling him multiple times telling him the issue DID NOT DO ANYTHING! And his name was RICKEY JORDAN. They are quick to take your money, but when crap hits the fan no one is there to help. No one should buy a car from this place because you might have to deal with headaches and stress!  I would just recommend getting a car from a big car dealer as in Findley or Fletcher dealerships. I put so much money into this and no one there is qualified to help besides take your money that you worked HARD for and run off without a warning. IN OTHER TERMS THIS PLACE SUCKS! I REGRET EVERY SINGLE DAY EVEN STEPPING INTO THIS BUILDING!"
0,"I actually took in vehicle today because my window wasn't going up. This is not only a mechanical issue but a safety issue as well. Someone could break into my vehicle! I did not make an appointment because it had happened the night before. I get to Carmax and after I explain my situation the woman I spoke to says \""so did you make an appointment?\"" Of course I didn't it just happened. The way she said it made it evident she didn't care about my situation. After asking her if there was anyway they could at least take a look at it she told me if I wanted they could tape up my window. That's ridiculous. When I purchased this vehicle the service was great. But now that I have a simple issue with it I get treated like crap. This definitely makes me reconsider my future business with Carmax when they gave me a hard time about a window."
3,"One of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Vegas! I love the reuben, especially how it's packed with corned beef, light on the cheese, and kraut. The portions are big, and I never skip on ordering the Matzo ball soup. Nice, casual place to eat."
1,My food was just ok. Not exactly what I ordered. Asked for ham but got bacon. The service was very bad. I had to flag them down to fill up coffee and they acted as they were doing me a favor. But the coffee was good. I may give them another chance.
2,"Decide to whip out a magazine or your MacBook, and voil\u00e0, you WILL stop receiving coffee! They weren't even subtle about it. Eye-rolls and whispering about it among the waitstaff. Wowsers!\n\nThat's exactly what happened to us. And we weren't even there for 25mins at that point. The impressive waitperson-to-table ratio makes this a turn-and-burn establishment that clearly does not want you to linger. Eat and run, or else!\n\nI guess that's OK because Weiss's 1970s decor, cramped booths and low ceilings do not inspire a lengthy meal anyways. You get the feeling that by 9AM the rent has been paid; the rest is gravy.\n\nFeeling 3-star-nice because the food was pretty good. But it's true that bad service keeps you from going back. Too bad - when we're recording at the studio on East Sunset Road, we're there for 3 or 4 days in a row for at least 2 meals each day. Still looking for our go-to spot in that neighborhood!"
4,"Breakfast, brunch, whatever; be ready to enjoy an absolutely delicious meal. The customer service is outstanding and the food even better. This place has a family feel to it. The Hall-ah french toast could not be more heavenly. The tongue sandwich: tender. Their latkas: luscious. Even their coffee will satisfy your cravings. Go there and be ready to be happy."
4,"Excellent in every aspect.  Had the White Fish platter, comes with 2 bagels, cream cheese,choice of salads,6 sliced tomatoes, capers, green and black olives, lettuce, pickle, etc.  Too much.. will be back without a doubt.  $16.95"
2,"We went to Weiss' for brunch on Sunday.  We had not been here in years and it seems like it may have gone downhill a bit.  Per other guests crammed into the waiting area, there was a 35-40 wait, but no one came to put our name on the list until we were standing there for 15 minutes.  He actually started taking the name of the group that just walked in the door instead of us and the others that came in before that group.  Unimpressed with that.  \n\nWhile I was waiting, I noticed that this place needs a major overhaul.  It looks really old and run down.\n\nWe were taken to a table after about 35 minutes and the chairs had standing water on them.  I asked the waitress if I could have a towel to wipe it down, but she was too busy filling the sweetener containers and was rude.  She never brought a towel so I had to ask a bus boy who brought some napkins.  Of course, she ended up being our waitness...figures.  \n\nI was torn between breakfast and lunch.  But I went with lunch and ordered the French Dip.  The meat was fantastic and would have been good on its own, but dipped in the au jus it was heavenly.   The pocket bun looked good, but it was so massive I just eat the meat with a fork.  The awesome food is the only thing that saved me from giving Weiss' one star because the experience was utterly lacking."
4,"Overall, it's the best deli in Vegas. Huge portions, fresh ingredients, courteous and efficient staff, and reasonable prices. Open faced Reuben is a fantastic meal sure to promise a full second meal's worth of leftovers, although it's not a perfect \""Reuben\"" sandwich per say. I've never been a huge fan of eating chicken salad sandwich's from restaurants, but their's is outright amazing and is in my usual rotation. Matzah ball chicken noodle soup is always the highlight of the meal for me, and I always get an order to go whenever I start to feel sick; it's the closest thing to \""mom's\"" you'll ever get. For breakfast, it's always hard for me to try anything other than the \""Ceily's Stack\"", it's savory breakfast heaven with massive latkes and meat covered in cheese and gravy.\n\nHas a nice family diner atmosphere, and service is definitely focused on efficiently turning customers over quickly; which feels nice when your from the Midwest or East Coast like I am. Get in, be smiled at, eat, get a refill, finish eating, and then leave. The way it should be; no lollygagging around with laptops out or any of that nonsense."
0,"Never will I return here.   Eh food and rude management!! Willing to lose a customer over $2 well he succeeded!!! Internet here sucks so I checked in on four square 2 min after I paid when I sat down.    I went up to the manager with my receipt and showed him the four square check in special which is $2 off a $5 order , we spent almost double that.  He refused to honor it because the transaction was done.  It was done 2 min ago!!! I won't be back and I told him that.  It's not that he couldn't do anything it's that he didn't want to.  Horrible management and customer service here.   My first and last time here.   They lost me as a customer."
0,"Imagine going to McDonalds for a Big Mac and finding out they've decided to only serve that particular sandwich (their most popular) once or twice a week.  That's what purchasing bread at Great Harvest Bread Company is like.  Well, no...that's what Great Harvest would be like if the girl behind the counter was flipping you off with a smile on her face at the same time.\n\nIn my opinion, their best item (besides their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies) is their loaf of Cheddar Garlic bread.  It's quite possibly the only reason why I still stop by this place anytime I'm in the area.  However, it's been a few years and I figured they may have replaced that item in that time.  So, I called one of their locations and was told that they still serve that particular bread on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n\nThis past Saturday, my father was looking for breadbowls for a soup his wife had prepared and I suggested Great Harvest.  We walked in and each got our complimentary piece of bread by the rudest girl that I have ever been helped by.  I looked at their racks and noticed a lack of Cheddar Garlic bread.  At this point, my sister asked the same girl if they had any in the store to purchase.  She responded with a scoff...\""I only make that bread on Thursdays.\""  Trust me when I say that you informing me that this item is unavailable will hardly lead to a meltdown on my part.  What I can't handle, however, is your show of annoyance at my inquiries and complete lack of customer service.  I not only won't be back, but I'll make sure to provide any friends, business contacts or general aquaintances with an alternative business that is only too happy to treat their customers as if they're actually wanted."
4,"Love this place!!\nWhen you go in wether  it is to look or order they give you a slice of homemade bread with butter as your there!! I have had sandwiches, rolls and bread from here and they all are fantastic..\nThe service is always great and this time we were welcomed by the store owner in which he told us how they make the breads. They do the whole wheat there where in back they have an area where they grind the wheat etc by hand!!\nAwesome place and will always go back"
2,"I've only frequented the one in Henderson on Sunset and the one on South Rainbow, both have been great for breakfast, the steak and eggs especially.  The happy hour at the South Rainbow location, with $2 drafts and 1/2 price appetizers. fantastic.  For that, these two places get an \""A\"".\n\nBut as someone noted, their reward card is now pretty much of a joke.  They changed the earning levels so dramatically, it would take me years to get a $10 credit...so on that, and for doing so without any advance notice or taking into consideration past credits earned, they get an \""F\"".\n\nSo they have 3 stars, the average between an \""A\"" and a \""F\""."
0,Hadn't been here for a while and decided to get some food to go.  Fish and chips was good.  Wings tasted like they had been cooked in old oil and the French Dip was horrible - the meat was as tough as shoe leather!  Will NOT eat here again!!
4,Took my daughter and her friend to get their nails and feet done.  The two of them had so much fun picking out what they wanted to do.  They chose ladybugs in a pink flower for the fingernails and ice cream cones for the toes.  She even put on SpongeBob on the TV for them too.  They had so much fun.
0,Horrible job on my nails!! Never go there! I had a smudge and the fixed it by putting three extra coats on and then the polish still smudged!
2,"From time to time I get into a hobby that will keep my interest for a little while. Most recently, it is jewelry making. Gentleman's accessory tend to be bland and cookie cutter, so the best remedy is to make your own. The act of sitting down and working on something is also good for the mind. It provides time to just sit back and concentrate on your hand/eye dexterity. Mine are as efficient as a toddler's, but that does not deter me from trying. Look in the local newspapers or mail for Michael's 40%-50% off coupons. Twine, wire, beads, clasps, and other jewelry equipment are inexpensive. It just takes some time to weed through everything."
0,"I ordered for delivery, they did not include cheese on my sandwich, the pizza was stone cold, but the worst part was how rude the worker was when I called.  I will never do business with them again even if they gave me everything for free, HORRIBLE"
2,"So I want to give this place 7 stars because they have zeppoles (and amazing zeppoles at that!), which I've found are hard to come by outside of NY.  But unfortunately I can't rate an entire restaurant on those, can I?  My husband ordered a meatball hero and fries, which he said were both awesome.  The garlic balls are delightful and, did I mention the zeppoles?  LOL.  And the prices are totally reasonable!  Now the not-so-good stuff: pizza was too salty and service was questionable at best.  We waited a long time for food to come, and when it did start coming, we waited longer in between each item!  Also, it came out in kind of a weird order.  Zeppoles before meatball hero before garlic balls before pizza?  I was so confused.  Our fault for not specifying \""appetizer, meal, dessert,\"" I suppose.  I noticed a family who came long after us had food before us!  Anyway, the prices and the zeppoles will keep me coming back and for those reasons you should give it a try too!"
0,I would not go to or order a pizza from this place. Raw pizza when asked for well done. Employees have a bad attitude the worst pizza restaurant in Southern Nevada. I will never go back to this place.
4,One of the best pizza places in town great food! good value! Im from the East Coast it's really hard to find a good pizza place tastes as good as theirs!
4,"I can only say good things about Napoli Pizza! Lord where do I start?! Well first off the prices are amazing! Even getting a medium pizza for a family of three feeds us for more than four days. The mushroom and pepperoni is mouth watering good! We usually order our pizza for pick-up or delivery, but going into the place is nice as well. The place is very quaint, and very nice. They have a couple of big screen TVs as well as a nice dinning room. Their staff is also friendly, friendly and extremely patient. Napoli will always be are go to for pizza, and I dare another pizza joint to even TRY and be better than Napolis!"
4,"I've been taking my dog to GVAH since he was 8 weeks old, for about 2.5 years now. I've been completely happy the whole time! Both vets are so nice and totally understand the \""pets as kids\"" thing. They are very calm and are open to questions any time. Walk-ins are welcome and there is rarely  a wait more than 5-10 minutes, even on the weekends. All of their shots are $10 and the rest of their prices are very reasonable. I love these vets and won't take my dog anywhere else!"
3,Allow me to start this review by introducing my partner in crime to the Yelp community; everyone meet Ashley D!  Ashley D was my date for this brunch meal at Mimi's about a week ago.  She enjoyed her previous experiences with Mimi's and recommended we try it out.\n\nMy initial impression of Mimi's for Sunday brunch was pleasant.  The decor and setting was fast paced and friendly.  The Cafe offered fresh coffee while you waited to be seated as they were slammed when we arrived.  We  were seated shortly and our waitress was easy going.  \n\nBoth of us being benedict fans couldn't resist the plethora of menu choices in that category as you can tell by the photo I submitted.  The food was all enjoyable and we had a great time.  I'm definitely returning for my Sunday brunch with my partner in crime real soon.
1,make sure you check the price on the shelf AND when they ring you up. very misleading and disappointing.
0,"It sounds like the food here is spectacular and I wish I'd have been able to try it. Unfortunately, I'm not cool with being pointedly ignored when I walk in somewhere and say hello to the person behind the counter. \n\nLong story short I walked in, was ignored. Went to counter, was ignored. Got order taken, tried to use a coupon, the lady said \""No.\"" \""I can't use it?\"" \""No.\"" \n\nOh. Alright.\n\nI was ordering the daily special and wanted to use an Entertainment coupon. I'd have understood if she had been really nice and just let me know that she would be losing money on a coupon. Then I'd have pocketed the coupon and went about with the order. I just don't like being treated like a stupid jerk. I get ignored and given attitude like this when I wear a name badge, I don't need it when I enter an establishment to spend money. So I told her I'd just go somewhere else and she shrugged.\n\nNo big loss for either of us, I suppose!"
0,"I'm always at Smith's Grocery store in the same plaza and am always curious about this place, so when my parents were in town visiting, I suggested we check it out because it just looks HUGE from the parking lot and plaza.  Umm not the case. It's a really small casino, and you're lucky to get a machine. We went on a Wednesday night and found it difficult to find one. Stayed maybe 15 minutes and decided to head to Sunset Station. Won't be back."
0,Me and my wife stopped by the place because of a 20 dollar groupon that we bought because we were checking out that sweet theatre next door. So we went to there cafe. After being seated we were ignored for a good hour. Even trying to flag anyone down was impossible. The waiter just walked by us as if we weren't there. Finally a bus boy took our order. Salad bar was good. Then they messed up on my check and charged me full price on my card. Completely ignoring my groupon. I will never come here again. No wonder there so dead inside.
3,"We really like this place.  The bartender introduced herself, and shook our hands!  We started talking about the beers they had.  So we decided to go with there special beer....I can't remember the name of it.  But they don't have it all the time. The brew master was present, he introduced himself to us as well, and the hubby and him started talking beer.  We tried a sample or 2 of the others, but didn't care for them.   As long as they still have the one we were drinking we will be back.\nThe menu looked pretty good, our hearts were set on something else for dinner.  But this was a nice change of pace.\nBefore we left, the bartender started telling us about there happy hour....SAY WHAT!  $2.00 beer....I'm not talking about Budweiser!  Premium beer 20 oz!  Yes, you will see a check in tomorrow!  lol"
0,"Worst. Barbecue. Ever.  We have been told by employees how great this Saturday night \""all you can eat\"" barbecue is for at least a year or so.  So we decided to finally try it and made a huge mistake.  We got there early, and waited while they brought the food to the steamtables - it must have been cold, since they were just carrying the metal pans and setting them in to warm up.  Then, when we finally got to eat - well, everything (except the chicken, which was swimming in sauce) was dry.  Dry ribs, dry brisket.  The brisket was also fatty and tasteless.  No real flavor to any of the meat.  Pulled pork was flavorless.  I guess they cook the meat, and then since they have a pan of barbecue sauce at the end, you're supposed to add all the sauce yourself.  How is that barbecue? It was way overpriced for the quality of the meal.  The only good thing was the coleslaw and cobbler, and that's not worth $13 a person."
1,I went here on recommendation of friend of friend. I missed lunch and crave Mex carbs. Traveling to LV I know this town is a virtual wasteland when it comes to good Mexican food.\n\nAs I walked in I had the feeling of deja vu knowing I had been here many years ago but no recollection of the food. There's a reason I blocked it out. \n\nDecided to sit at bar. Bartender was attentive and best part of the experience. Great chitchat and good Margarita. \n\nI had the (recommended) enchilada and chili Verdi burrito. The burrito was ok. The pork was pretty tender but there was potato chunks as filler. The beef enchilada was cold. She took it away and said they would put it in the microwave... Says it all there.\n\nWon some money in the bar slot machine and no charge for the drink. So the meal was cheap. No repeat
4,"One of my most cherished spots for the last 15 years and home of the Best Margaritas in Las Vegas.  When you walk in prepare to be hit with an authentic Sante Fe New Mexico feel and a southwestern food with a slight twist. Free chips, salsa, and re-fried beans wet your appetite for an experience that is sure to lift the spirits. I normally stick with the carne asada or flautas but I've never had a bad meal in 15 years at this place."
0,"I haven't been here in a really long time. This place has been in Green Valley longer than any other place I think. It was just terrible.The walls are a dingy yellow, with plaster repair spots all over. The plastic holder on our table was so dirty it stuck to my fingers, and you could hardly read through it. I ordered the crab enchilladas. They used mealy ground up canned crab meat that tasted like crap. Stale old rice and beans. None of the food at our table looked good, my friends said it was OK. There are many mexican places in town, I won't be coming back here. The best part of the meal was the margarita, large is $13, no thanks."
4,"Ah, yes, Bangkok Orchid...My family has been coming here for the best local Thai food since 1994? My father found this place and we loved it ever since!  We sometimes go there when my mom doesn't feel like cooking...sorry Mom!  We seem to order the same thing everytime.  Mom orders the Glass Noodles with Chicken, Dad-Spicy Beef Salad ( and he orders them really spicy!), lil brothers likes the Satay Chicken and Red Curry Chicken, and I like the Pad Thai and Spicy Fillet Fish(I think it's catfish).  At the end of every meal, mom orders the Coconut Ice Cream in a real halve Coconut! Which is heaven!  The service is great , the crew is really nice, and the price is reasonable.  If  you never been to this place, try going there during Lunch time for their specials!"
0,"Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better."
3,"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Really nice people run the place and it's relatively inexpensive. I had the pad see ew, the mint chicken and the tom yum soup. Their soup is probably the best tom yum I have had in town."
1,"Not impressed with this Walmart McDonalds. As the cashier told the two customers that asked for a Frape Caramel, \""This is the only location that doesn't have Frape Caramels (not sure about that ).\"" The tables were also dirty (felt consciousness about taking a picture with the customer there). With an In & Out Burger in the parking lot, I would have to be craving a Big Mac or not want to deal with a walk in hot temperatures to eat anything more than $5 here."
4,"We recently discovered our sectional sofa pieces were on sale and excitedly decided to add another ottoman to our collection.\n\nMacy's makes it so easy to shop over the phone, and they even went out of their way to try to locate the piece locally to save us shipping (darn, it's coming from CA).\n\nThe quality is very nice, especially for the price point (we purchased the Vice Versa leather sectional after much research and trepidation).  Can't wait for the new piece!  We'll be able to configure the pieces like a large lounge/chaise - or any other way we want."
1,"Shopping in a mall has become a thing of the past for me, but I have a gift card that has been burning a hole in my pocket so we decided to do some good old-fashioned shopping in a department store. The store is pretty outdated and I was little disappointed by the lack of inventory to choose from. \n\nI was pretty sad by how little enjoyment I had in this shopping trip. It felt like more of a chore than anything."
2,Draft shouldn't be blank.
0,Terrible wings and service was not great. Waste of money the waitress was nowhere to be found anytime we needed anything.  Also she was too busy rubbing her stomach to pay attention to her customers!  NEVER AGAIN HOOTERS!!!
2,"We love Hooters!! Wednesday Wings day is awesome and the peanut butter pie is to die for! Girls are cute, but not amazing..  All in all it's a great place though I wish it had the same menu as the Hooters in California. Lemon pepper wings... Just saying!"
2,"I was in the area after getting my car serviced and I needed to pick up a couple of things for my wife.  Siri led me here.  Almost all Walmarts are the same unless they're older one.\n\nI found what I needed quickly, went to one of the quick checkout lanes that had NO ONE in line, and I was out the door in no time whatsoever.  Not bad.\n\nThe woman who checked me out was very pleasant.  I'd come back here if I happened to be in the area and needed something but it's the opposite side of the valley from where I live."
0,Whoever came up with the solution for checkout for Thanksgiving Day should be fired.   The lines were crazy.  I stood for 30 minutes in a line to checkout just to find out that the line lead to NOWHERE.   People were leaving empty handed because they could not figure out how to check out.    There was no way to get from one side of the store to the other because of the way they had the lines winding through the entire store.    People opened the 6pm things way before 6 and since people were still in line at 7:30 they went ahead and took what they wanted from the 8pm release since they would not be to the register until after 8.    I did not get out of there until 9:15pm .  It is my opinion they tried to over organize it and they made shopping crazy.     I did like that they had added security that they hired.   I also thought it was cute that McDonalds had a cart that they were selling things from in the store.  But the stuff was cold if you bought it.  (Great idea in theory but a hotbox would have helped.)    Maybe next year have numbers that people get when they are ready to check out.    Call them by the 100's   all of the 100's please come to the register area.   If they are not ready   too bad they need to get a new number.     That will teach them for getting a number before they are ready.    All the 200's your up.    This would keep people from standing in lines and they can maybe use that time walking around the store buying other things.
1,"So I responded via email per request to the CSR rep below and she was concerned and courteous.  I emailed her maybe twice and another corporate rep also emailed with concern and humor.  I was then told that the local district manager would be contacting me within the week.  That was a few weeks ago.  I am really over a bad customer experience a month ago, but it is a shame the disconnect between local and corporate.  I need no further contact from dsw, but did feel the need to update the review."
2,"Went to Men's Wearhouse today to rent a tux with my friends for my good friends upcoming wedding.  The store was good sized and all the dress items were evenly spaced and very easy to peruse.  \n\nThe service was great, I would definitely recommend looking online and taking a printout of what rental your like so they can match it up and give feedback.  The tailors were thorough and concise.  I must say this place is great when it comes to the value and service."
0,My husband has a certain brand of pants he needs for work.  Before moving here we've always shopped at Men's Wearhouse.  Unfortunately this location has failed us.  \n\nWe have stopped in here a few times. Each time the items we needed were out of stock.  Each time the customer service was well below par.   I would always try to make eye contact so they would acknowledge us but no luck.  \n\nThe bottom line is to save yourself the aggravation.  Just order online if you know specifically what you need.  Plus we found sale prices online that weren't advertised in the store.
3,"only been there once and have no complaints.\nim not a huge fan of sushi, but actually tried a variety of things at this one and LIKED them. \n\nthe service was SUPER good. The lady that served us talked like she knew us for years. we were also there till closing and the rest of the staff started conversations and joked around as well. very easy going there. which is a big plus.\n\nits a little tiny cute place tucked in the corner.\ntheir prices arent bad at all.\n\nstacie roll, YUM."
1,We normally enjoy Red Robin and one of our favorite things is the fries. We had never been to this location but stopped for a quick lunch. The fries were terrible. They were mushy and we didn't even finish the side order that came with our burgers. We won't be visiting this location again.
2,"I've been to local Red Robin's in the Bay Area and considering that it's a franchise, they make everything the same at all restaurants. Needless to say, this place isn't all that great. I can come here to eat every now and then, but it's not off the wall where I tend to want to come back more than often.\n\nWe ordered an onion ring tower which was HUGE! and ok tasting. I'm not much of a onion ring lover and that might have an impact on why I didn't think it tasted great. Me and the wifey also shared a chicken pasta which wasn't all that tasty in my opinion, probably won't ever order it again. But what I do like about this place is their fish, fries and shrimp sampler appetizer, although we didn't order it at the time we came to this place, I did have it a few times when coming to another Red Robin and I do recommend it to others when coming here.\n\nAll in all this place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars as food wasn't that great here when we ate. Sorry Red Robin I just know you can do better."
2,"I happened to be in the mall of all places while on vacation in Vegas.\n\nDecided to pop in and relax while I had a little lunch - seeing how shopping can really drain your energy as well as your wallet.  I know what you're thinking - Red Robin? There's a TON of great places to eat in Vegas - why the hell would you end up there?  Well- I was craving a great burger, and I needed one FAST.\n\nThis RR is probably just like all the other RRs you've ever walked into in your entire life.  I was seated in a small table near the window, looking into the busy Galleria mall.  After checking out the menu, I decided on a \""Keep it Simple\"" plain burger.   The server apologized for the longish wait and took my order.  It took what I thought was a long time for my food to finally arrive - but I was pleased with both the quality and how large my burger was.  I wasn't in a big hurry, so the wait didn't really bother me.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a gourmet burger, check out RR in the Galleria mall.  I'd like to explore the menu and try different burgers the next time I'm there.\n\n3 outta 5 stars from me - worth checking out if you're in the area."
3,"Well for gourmet burgers it was ok. The server Dominic was pretty awesome. The establishment is clean, friendly, and family oriented. I know this review is coming a few months late but I honestly have nothing memorable about the food except for the bottomless fries and I do remember the burger I ordered was a bit dry and thinking if I come back here I'm never ordering THAT again. Wish I could remember what it was called...That was a plus. I will come by again if I'm in the area...have to give the place a second try. :)"
1,"Waitress and waiters are really nice but other than that this place is not the best service.\n\nOur table had no drink menus. Our cheese sticks were not hot, warm but the cheese wasn't even melted. No utensils or napkins and took forever to get one. Main dish wasn't hot. \n\nMy main thing was hot food! Probably coordination between when to take the food to the guests needs help!!"
2,"We never, ever have good service here.  About a year ago, we waited at the hostess stand for so long that we decided to leave.  When we got to our car and put it in reverse, all of a sudden, a waitress comes knocking on my window!  It scared the living daylights out of me and made me almost feel sorry for her.  I guess times really ARE hard when a waitress comes outside and figuratively begs for her lost tip.\n\nAnyway, I was dismayed when that same waitress ended up at our table last night.  It was obvious why we waited so long to be seated during the previous visit.... she was slooooooow and seemed completely oblivious to my agitation.  There were only two tables in the whole restaurant, so a glass of water shouldn't take 15 minutes to deliver.  Ugh.  \n\nThe three stars are for the STEAK TIPS.  Oh my, they are good.  Whether you get them as a breakfast platter or a dinner platter is irrelevant.  The sides don't matter at all either way.  I haven't actually had more tender, flavorful, and consistently good steak tips anywhere else.  I don't say that lightly either - I'm a carnivorous sort of lady.\n\nSo come here if you've got all night to waste, because it's probably gonna take that long to get your order.  But if you order the steak tips, it'll be worth the wait!"
1,"Our server was pretty cranky. We have a large group (8 adults and 5 kids under 4 years of age), which I know can be stressful. But the service was terrible and the food mediocre. There weren't enough table settings (and they never got us any more, so none of the kids had silverware). The only upside is thy the food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly."
0,"What a terrible experience at this one! I have never seen a worse ran store of any type. If you are a regular you get to skip non regular's in line because they walk in the door get their order's made skip you in line and you don't even get asked what you want until that regular has their food and has paid! We were in line before three of these regulars walked in and they had everything and paid before we were spoken to. I called the area manager Rosita and didn't even get a call back, too bad that this area of Einstein's has failed miserably! I was a huge fan of Einstein's in other cities but will never visit another one again. I know these are very strong words, but they are very well deserved!"
1,"I use to actually work here a few years ago when the economy first tanked and I had to do something outside the scope of network engineering/administration. I saw first hand what it was like at this auto center, and besides the fact that the meager commissions I made were often times stolen by one of the other associates, the customer service here is just typical of a large corporation attempting to service the public. Let us continue.\n\nI too purchased tires here because of the warranties. However because of the tire size on my car I had to go with some BF Goodrich traction T/A's. They're not the best tire out there by any means, but they should be good enough to not have to worry about cracking and other things. Well, my rear tires are now cracking all over the place, and regardless of what anyone tells you, tires should NOT crack after a year or less of owning them. That doesn't typically happen until they've been on your vehicle a few years. And yes the incredibly hot climate in Vegas might speed this up a tad, but these tires were cracking far too prematurely. \n\nSo I went in to see if they can swap them out and give me some type of manufacturer defect (premature cracking) on the tire and just swap them out with new tires of the same brand. Well as it turns out these particular tires were discontinued but they did have some Goodyear tires in the same size, but they were of course more expensive. After all the tread depth discounts were put into the system the total still came out to $211 for new tires. That's unacceptable. First off, its not my fault these tires are discontinued, that's BF Goodrich's fault for making garbage tires. Secondly, in the case of customer service, I should've just been refunded close to the full price of what I paid originally. This did not happen and yet Sears again fails on customer service. This is probably why so many of their stores have closed nationwide. Their craftsman warranties are great (lifetime) but dealing with many of the associates there can be an uphill battle. (I worked for Sears Auto Center in California for 4 years while I was going to school and management just makes one bad decision after another which ultimately effects you, the customer)\n\nIf you are intending on visiting this particular service center, only speak to one man by the name of Rick. There's one other gentleman I've had good luck with there but I'm unsure if he even works there anymore. The rest of the sales associates seem like they're just passing time there before they die. They have a very lackadaisical and cavalier attitude toward work in general (remember I've worked with these people, I know them more intimately than an average customer) and they just really couldn't care less about your customer experience. \n\nAs an aside, my mom brought her car here to have her alternator tested because it literally died on the freeway while she was driving. After they tested it they said the alternator and battery was fine. This was not the case. Sears likes to tell people that they can test for these things but they have a cheap, piece of junk miniature sabre voltage testing machine for this that doesn't even give accurate details about your vehicle. Long story short, she took it to MY mechanic at T&M Automotive and of course it was a simple alternator swap. She had it replaced and its been months without a single issue for her.\n\nSo perhaps Sears should seriously evaluate the people whom they have interacting with the public, both behind the counter and in the shop a little better. I know they're bordering on Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but surely you can do better than this. Furthermore, instead of having their vehicle technicians sit behind a computer and take multiple choice tests on vehicle diagnosis to get the job, (yes, aside from brakes and such, the guys back there are just techs that take a test on a computer to work there, none are ASE certified) maybe an in person interview with someone actually asking questions about car symptoms and what the likely remedy is would be more constructive. Also gauging how they are with customer service may be helpful as well. I've seen so many managers fired from Sears Auto Centers who have actually done the RIGHT thing for customers, its not surprising why these places run as poorly as they do."
2,"Not bad for the prices- we happen to be in the neighborhood and the mister was crazing \""olive garden\"" so we decided to try this instead.  They have a spaghetti and meatballs special for $6.99 that includes a salad and bread so I decided to get that.  The mister got the chicken piccatta and we ordered dipping sauces ( marinara/alfredo) for the bread.  I also ordered the minestrone soup and Caesar salad.\n\nThe caesar salad was good- they were a little heavy handed with the dressing but at least it did not taste like the caesar in a bottle- tasted almost homemade with a slight anchovy flavor.\nMinestrone soup was also okay- had plenty of vegetables, beans and was not too salty.\nMy spaghetti and meatballs was, well, spaghetti and meatballs- something I could've made at home.  The meatballs were nice and moist but had an odd flavor to me, tasted like they seasoned it with alcohol or something but it was fine after a few bites.\nThe mister's chicken piccatta was actually pretty good, plenty of mushrooms and capers.  Just the right amount of lemon too.\n\nOverall, I would say it was a success. Not sure if I would make a special trip back but if we happen to be in the casino and craving italian, we might venture in again..."
0,"First off I have to give this place 1 star but if I could give it NO stars I would! \n\nA group of us are in town for a bowling tournament at Sunset Station and decided to have dinner at this place because its inside the casino and convenient, and the decor looked like it would be a nice place for a nice dinner with friends. About the only this this restaurant has going for itself is the appearance. The furniture is nice and modern and the restaurant itself looks remodeled. But don't let that fool you, what comes out of the kitchen is terrible, but more about what they call \""food\"" later...\n\nWe had a reservation for 12 people at 8pm. We arrived early and requested to be seated, it was about 10 mins before 8pm. It wasn't like they didn't have the tables ready because we did make a reservation and no one was sitting at the tables we were going to, but nonetheless we sat down about 10 after 8pm. Because of the size of our group we had to split into 2 tables. We sat for about 10 mins before anyone even came by to greet us or offer any drinks.  The water boy finally came, then the waitress about 10 mins after him. We were starving so we ordered our drinks, appetizers/salads, and entrees at the same time. I wish someone would have told us that it would take over 30 mins to get our salads and another 45 mins to get our food. In fact people who came in after us, ordered their food, got their food, ate their food, and left before we even for our entrees. Bad, bad, bad service only gets worse.\n\nThe food was terrible! Overall it was just bad. Only 1 person out of our entire group was satisfied with the quality of his food, he got the steak. I ordered the veal scaloppini, and when it came it was a disaster! I asked what was in the sauce because it looked creamy and I'm lactose intolerant, the waitress said it was lemon butter. I made my bf taste it, he said it wasn't good and had cream in the sauce, so I sent it back and asked for just some plain pasta with marinara sauce. The veal was pounded super thin, and it was hard to cut through and tasted really bland according to my bf. The waitress didn't even know what was in the food she served, SMH. After waiting for another 20 mins without the food coming I decided to cancel my order all together because everyone else was done with their meals. My bf ordered the chicken marsala, which was so gross that when I took a bite I chewed on it for about 30 seconds before I had to spit it out! It was BAD!!!\n\nWe had to call a manager come over because everything was so bad. But he must know how bad the food and service was because it seemed like he heard it all before. He wasn't apologetic or seemed to care at all. He did say, however that our waitress Jessica is one of the best they have, which didn't mean much because she wasn't great and our service sucked! I asked for a split check, she acknowledged it, then brought one check with everyone's meal on it. Ummmmm... Hello?????\n\nFood service was terrible, food quality was worse. Oh BTW, I should mention that the same jerk manager who did nothing for us ordered his food after us, sat down and ate it at the bar in front of us, and finished before we even for our salads. You would think that at some point he would've looked up and said, \""hey they've been sitting there for a while without any food, I should go see whats going on...\"" but no, he sat there watching tv, eating his food.\n\nI should mention that the restaurant was a little busy when we first sat down, but after an hour of us being there, only 4 tables were seated in addition to ours. So it wasn't like they were busy and that's why the food and service were Bad...\n\nI wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!!! DO NOT EAT AT PASTA CUCINA UNLESS YOU WANT TERRIBLE FOOD AND EVEN WORSE SERVICE!!!"
0,"Horrible service, 30 minutes to get dry steaks and it was not even crowded in the restaurant! What a waste of money to dine here! Trust me people do not waste your time or money at Sonoma unless you want your night ruined"
2,"The place is beatiful, the food was ok, nothing spectacular...  The service was SLOW!!!!!  we all got rather irritated over how long it took to get our food, and we all ordered the same thing, the steak and lobster, we must have waited almost 30 min... \n\nI doubt i will be returning."
3,"3.5 stars\n\nI had seen this place driving by but found out it was an in network benefit when I checked my insurance website.  I'd been sick for 4 days and was in denial that it was anything more than an upper respiratory infection, or a cold.  I finally decided to head in knowing my symptoms weren't ER worthy, but realizing that my primary care wouldn't be able to swab for the flu.  \n\nWhen I walked in I noticed a very strong scent.  Being sick, it was actually a little unbearable.  I wasn't sure if it was a strong cleaning product or a room deodorizer but I was really bothered by it! \n\nWhen I checked in at the front desk I asked the woman if they swabbed for the flu.  She said yes but that I'd probably be there for hours.  I wasn't sure if she was just informing me of the long wait, or discouraging me from waiting, but I proceeded to sign in.  \n\nThe good: I was only there a couple of hours in total, which was better than I though with how badly they were playing up the wait time.  The place was clean.  Plenty of seats in the waiting room.\n\nThe bad: One of the techs or medical assistants didn't introduce themselves when they came in to do a test on me.  When I received my discharge papers no one went over the prescription (side effects, how and when to take, etc.).  I'm not sure if this was because they knew I was in the healthcare field or not, but either way I would never hand my patients a prescription and then say, \""you're free to go.\""  \n\nIt's never fun to have to go to Urgent Care but if you really need to, this isn't a bad place to go.  It's better than waiting 8 hours and clogging up a busy ER with flu-like complaints, and it's probably more beneficial to you than waiting a few days to see your doctor.  I'd go again if needed."
2,"Had the Crunchy Chicken Spinach Salad while waiting for my oil change and it was totally great. Service was fine, though the place was nearly empty.\n\nThe decor involves a lot of red, black-and-white checkers, that nostalgic glitter diner furniture, and a bit of automobile nostalgia. My coffee was slightly stale, but that's any diner for you. I could have asked for a replacement.\n\nThis is also the first place I've seen in Henderson with an actual lunch counter, if that's your thing. I'm sure there's gotta be more lunch counters in Henderson..."
0,"liars, thieves, dont keep their word and are worse in customer service. i will never return again and neither will my friends or family. i love toyota vehicles, but i will have to invest in a honda."
0,"I took my car into the dealership to get the first oil change (new FR-S I bought in February). I also mentioned that the air pressure light would randomly come on but it was no longer on and the tire pressure was fine in all of the tires. The service staff member carefully looked at all of the tires and also stated they look fine, no noticeable issues with pressure, and he did not see any nails. He said they would change the oil and look at the tire pressure light issue.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later he approached me in the waiting area stating that there was a nail in my tire and that they took it out and tried to fix it but then they realized it was a little close to the wall of the tire and they could not repair it so I needed to purchase a new tire. Then he handed me an invoice for almost $300 for one new tire. \n\nI explained to him that I did not authorize anyone to take the nail out of the tire and asked him why they would do that without first consulting me? I did not authorize such work in the service agreement I signed. I have never had a situation where a service shop would do something like that without my consent. I explained to him that Findlay's actions were not authorized and that I am now being forced to purchase a new tire which sounds a little like a scam to me. His response was that if I didn't purchase a new tire they could put the spare on for me and send on my way. I asked if the spare was a true spare or a donut and he said he would go check.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later he came back and guess what.....all of a sudden the story changed. Seems the service guy did NOT take the nail out after all and he is just going to pump the tire up and put it back on the car. Without even getting into how much of a SCAM this is, I told him the tire was not flat, or even low, when I brought it in so I don't understand why the guy had to \""pump it up\"". He had no answer for me.  \n\nI fully believe this was a scam to lead me to believe that I HAD to buy a new tire. Had I not questioned the actions of the service and blindly took them at their word that the nail was removed, they tried to fix it but after it was out they couldn't, I would have been forced to spend $300 on a new tire for THEIR unauthorized work. To further my belief that this I a total scam, only after I refused to blindly pay $300 and questioned their actions did it come out that in fact they had NOT done the work they originally claimed to have done.\n\nI don't know if it was because I was a single female and they thought they had a sucker on the line, or if this is status quo for Findlay but either way it is so wrong.\n\nI got my car and I left.  At that moment they lost me as customer and forever lost my recommendation."
4,Love Honeybaked Hams... and their Turkey is excellent too!  \nYou can even get sides for a complete and delicious meal!\nOR... you can go for lunch and order a tasty sandwich and side.\n\nSuggestion... call ahead and order the size ham you want.... especially if you are ordering during holiday times.
0,Worst bank/cu I've ever used. Fees for everything!! They're just crooks trying to rip off hard-working people.
1,"It's been a long time since I've been here.  I will have to edit this once I figure out what I ordered, I can't remember what it is at this time. But I didnt like it!!!!! I should have ordered what my husband got was the pastrami, it was huge!  looked just like the picture!"
1,"I have been to this Jasons Deli several times, it has always been good.  We have ordered delivery from here several times, it has always been very delicious.  I ordered delivery from here today, and it was very forgetable.  The butter croissant that held my turkey sandwich together was really dried out, it was actually breaking as I ate it, it was that dry.  I have said before that they have the best brownies I have ever had....... Just not today. The brownies were overcooked,  one of them actually tasted burned.... they were very dry, not moist and fudgy the way they have been, when I have had them before.  Everything was disappointing about this meal...... it might be awhile before I order from here again."
0,"My credit card information was stolen after I purchased lunch from this location. I called the manager the next day to simply alert her that there may be an issue with their machine. She absolutely denied any possibility of the fraud charges coming as a result of her store, she even went as far as to tell me that \""None of my employees even know anyone in California\"" (CA is where the fraudulent spending came from). Her reaction to my call was that of a remarkably poor manager, particularly considering that I didn't call to complain, just inform.\n\nBe warned-- fraudulent charges appeared on my card after paying for a meal at this Jason's Deli. That, coupled with a ridiculous reaction from the manager are enough to keep me from returning."
0,"worse than the garbage they call their enchilada sauce.\nMy husband and I went there this evening, the man who took our order (finally) spoke one word the whole time we were ordering which was \""combo?\"" To my request for the #3. We got home to discover his beef nachos filled with bell pepper and onions. No big deal, maybe we should've asked. We go back, I explain he doesn't eat this and ask to exchange it. The man has to call the manager (while I'm at the car explaining to my husband that ALL their meat choices apparently come with the peppers and onions) I come back and he gives me his phone so the manager can explain that her employee told us there would be peppers and onions in the meat. I asked if she would just refund my money and she very condescendingly said \""well just this once\"". No apology, no customer service  .\nI would rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the next closest one than go back."
4,"I have been coming to this salon for about 2 years and i have always been extremely happy with their work. My hairstylist, Valerie, is super. She is great to talk to while I'm getting my haircut and is really great at doing my hair. During the shampoo she does scalp massages with mint shampoo that relax even the most stressed person. If I wasn't moving I'd still go there for every haircut."
4,"I called in an order after leaving a near by tanning salon. I arrived earlier than my estimated pick up time by 15 minutes. Instead of making me wait, they got my order together right away. Very fast, friendly service. \nI've never been disappointed with their food. They are consistent with the quality and quantity every single time I eat here."
4,"Among my favorite places to eat. Fair price, great food, outstanding service, \""hot\"" means hot. The staff is always friendly, my glass NEVER hits half empty and I drink ALOT of water. They also almost always give my kids free desert. They are awesome."
3,"This restaurant is one of those strip mall hole-in-the-wall types.  It's tucked away, unseeming, and with little character on the outside.   Frank chose this place on yelp and, to my dismay, we sat in the car justifying our choice for eating here.\n\nWe hesitated a bit while walking toward the door, unsure of what lay ahead, but we sucked it up and entered the front door holding our breath and expected the worst (dirty floors, bad service, poor food).  Thankfully, we were wrong.  This cute restaurant has the old school bamboo chairs and tables with menus ready to go.  There are a few servers ready to take your order and watching each table for refills or other needs.  We were seated promptly, received our drink order within a minute and took a good look at the menu.\n\nTheir lunch menu is simple--choose a meat, choose a sauce and it's 5.95. We wanted the regular menu, though, so we glanced at it and discovered some interesting dishes we never heard of; two, in fact: Bangkok 9 stripped crispy chicken and the beef.  They both had the same finish--a sweet chili sauce with garlic.  I decided to jump in and try something that sounded different to me, and we ordered off the regular menu at 8 dollars a pop.\n\nThe food didn't take long at all, and we were occupied with their lovely steamed (by request) vegetable dumplings that had the thai flavors mixed in.  The sweet soy dip was great, too, and judging by the appetizer we assumed that the lunch itself would be great.  We were right.  First off, the food was beautiful.  The chicken dish was shiny and glazed over with this transluscent, orange chili sauce.  It smelled fantastic.  Although flour coated fried stripped beef doesn't look as appealing, it didn't taste anything like the visual expectation of it.\n\nTheir sauce on these dishes are great; sweet, slightly spicy (you can order no heat) and had a garlic (subtle) finish.  The chicken and beef remain nice and crispy despite the sauce, which is something I always look for in fried dishes like that.  It was like eating crispy light pieces of chicken heaven drenched in sweet love.  The plates were piled high, too, so sure enough we had leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nThey provide a bowl of rice enough for 3 - 4 helpings between 2 people, and because the sauce is slightly tangy and sweet (it's really like a thai version of a sweet & sour, but better) the rice is nice to cut that while eating.  By the time we finished the rice bowl was cleaned out and the leftovers neatly packed with more rice (they did it on their own, which was nice).  We patted our tummies and paid a 20 dollar bill (not including tip) that includes 2 dishes, an appetizer and drinks!  Their lunch menu, although cheaper, was good, but I'm so glad we tried their Bangkok 9 dishes instead.\n\nIf you're looking for cheap eats in a place where two worlds collide on a plate, try this hidden restaurant in Henderson near Hobby Lobby.  It's good, it's filling, and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet.  You know how I know it was good?  I dreamt about it and craved it the next day.  As a matter of fact I'm going to end this now so I can drive down there for dinner.  Ciao!\n\nPS: If any Guam people read this review, remember House of Chin Fee?  The chicken dish I refer to tastes like their sweet & sour chicken.  I grew up on it, so I'm a fan :)"
0,"Lunch specials & staff have always been consistently good, but we ordered dinner for pick-up and it was awful, just AWFUL.  Two noodle dishes were overcooked to a stuck together glob. Just over-spiced with hot sauce and had almost NO veg mixed in.  Spring roll was tasteless & poorly assembled too.  It was so bad we have decided to even stop going at lunch as we will not support a restaurant that would put out as sub par as we they gave us tonight."
1,"Boy how things have changed.  The staff and menu are the same, but the way the food is prepared is completely different (not in a good way) and the service has become very slow.\n\nI'm not sure what happened, by I hope they get their act together."
2,"Lunch with my mom\nNot Thai spicy\nOK\n\nSo, last Saturday, I had lunch with my mom at Bangkok 9 while waiting for the dealer to finish up repairs on her car. We were actually heading to L&L but when I saw Thai, she didn't argue with me when I suggested it. \n\nNice, clean place. Open dining room - friendly staff. It wasn't very busy but it was a little on the warm side and if I lived in the Las Vegas Valley, I'd be out on the lake cooling off.\n\nAnyway, I opted for the Pad See Oew and I asked for Thai spicy. She didn't understand my request and asked me for a spice level from 1-10. I told her a 9 or 10. When my dish arrived, I was excited because it was steaming hot and it looked to be spicy as I could see the pepper flakes on the noodles and even on the vegetables. \n\nBut it wasn't. That was a big disappointment for me because I wanted and I asked for really hot. Either they didn't feel like I could handle it or they just don't make it Thai spicy. Otherwise, the food as far as taste goes - was ok. It wasn't bad and I actually finished off the entire dish. But it wasn't so good that I'll make a trip out to Henderson to order that same dish again. \n\nDecent prices overall. Decent service as well. My mom really appreciated how they packaged up her to go container with the left over Mongolian Beef and white rice she didn't finish. They actually separated the two selections using foil in the same container. Attention to details like that got them the third star for me."
0,Absolutely disgusting.  Ive been here before and it was good. I just tried it again and got pad thai. The chicken was old and smelled and the shrimp was overcooked and not cleaned. I will never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
0,"We ordered to go, and the food was not great. We will not eat here again.\n We ordered the red curry chicken. It was watered down like soup, and other than the hot chile, there wasn't much flavor in it.  We ordered the chicken satay. My 6 year old said,\"" How am I supposed to eat this, it is so hard?\"" It was so hard and dry she couldn't even bite into it. We ordered the ginger chicken- again watery broth and you couldn't even taste the ginger."
1,Awful customer service.  They swear they are a high end store.  All I did was ask for a military discount and they swore I was robbing them or taking it out of their paychecks...come on!\nGEEZ...
0,"I had a horrible experience here! I am from Hawaii and usually get my nails done there but I am often in the Vegas area for work so I thought I would give this place a try. I am sorry that I did! I needed to take off and do a new set since my french nails had grown out. Instead of telling me that they did back fills, she took them off. First of all though, they did my pedicure. Normally, while doing my pedicure, most places that I have patroned will soak my nails to make it easier and faster to remove them later. Not this place! So, she starts to take off my nails using another nail tip. The place where I get my nails done in Hawaii does a really good job of bonding the acrylics to my natural nails so she had a hard time with taking them off. I have a pretty good tolerance for pain but after a while, I couldn't take it! She kept saying over and over again how this was the first time she had had any trouble taking off nails before. I mean constantly saying it to the point where I started to get irritated! I wanted to tell her to just shut her trap because she kept saying it like it was some excuse that she sucked at this! I told her that normally, nail salons would just soak my nails and sand them down until they were gone but she kept on trying to pry them off. I couldn't take it any more! It hurt so bad that I pulled my hand away and yelled in agony! She still didn't get it so I had to raise my voice a little and tell her to stop doing what she was doing since it wasn't working and it was extremely painful. I told her to just soak them and sand them down because this was obviously not working. When she finally got them off, She did the acrylics and she did an ok job. I did have to tell her to fix one that she had made crooked. Finally, I get gel overlay, so after they were dry, she noticed that there were bumps on most of my nails. So she files them down and puts gel on only one nail! I didn't understand why only one when there were others that were scratchy on the surface! I told her that I wanted them all smoothed out by putting another coat of gel but she said they were on the sides and I didn't need it. By then her appointment had sat at her station and I didn't want to make a scene. I will never go back to this place for my nails! The next day, one of my nails started lifting. A few days later, More than half of my nails started lifting. By then I was out of town already! The pedicure wasn't the best I had but it was still good. I felt rushed though. : ("
0,"This place is HORRIBLE. I went in for a set of French gel nails and they looked BAD. The nails weren't painted all the way, the white lines were crooked and uneven. They chipped within the first 15 minutes. I went to another salon because I didn't want to complain and they said it would be $15 just to remove the gel. I went back and waited for the lady who did my nails (no trying to make a scene or get her in trouble) and told her I didn't want my money back and to please just take it off. At first she said no they look fine. Another girl looked at them and I asked to speak with a manager. I was told no manager would be there until tomorrow. The original lady then kept saying I am too picky and that I want to look like a model, but can't so I blame her.. (lol really?) At that point I said either have someone fix them or take them off and refund my money. The other girl finally got the manager on the phone and said they would remove them and refund my money. Then the original person began drilling so quickly that she was hitting the skin and making me bleed. I asked her to slow down and that it hurt and she's rolls her eyes and says or what are you going to call the manager? She doesn't care. She also said you can't be a model and I bet you do this all the time. I said no, I went somewhere else to get it fixed first and told you they were full of bubbles.  I asked the other girl to finished. They refunded my money and I gave the girl who finished $10. I went without my nails done and returned without my nails done. $10 to fix her mistake. NEVER AGAIN!!"
1,"We have gone here a few times. \n\nMy gf being a vegetarian really loves the fresh salads and vegetables they have, It is a good selection and it is always fresh, but dang, its expensive for salads. \n\nService is always prompt. They also walk around with cookies and offer them to the tables, my kids love it of course, who doesn't like a nice warm cookie???\n\nAnd something else I hate is getting banged for drinks. I think they were 2.50 or 3 bucks. For soda fountain drinks???? \n\nIn the back section of the restaurant it always smells like feet too.. Just an observation.. :)                    \n\nThe pastas are just OK. Sometimes the soups are good. A friend of mine told me there is no way you can eat as much food as you paid for. I kind of believe that every time I go there.. \n\nThe funny thing is, with all this mediocrity, the place is always packed! \nI guess people love a so so place.\n\nI dunno, Sunset Station is just down the road, its cheaper and better and drinks are included!!!! \n\nI'm just sayin,,,,"
3,"I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations available. Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's $2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft. \n\nThe price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too.\n\nThe service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here."
1,"Oh Sweet Tomatoes how I USED to love you... Seems like this location has gone way down hill. Went for dinner with my hubby on a Thursday night at 445pm to try and beat the crowd. So many veggie bins on the salad line were empty or looked less than appetizing since someone would spill other stuff into another bin. Yuck. There were tons of kids running amuck thru the line as well putting their hands on everything. One kid had an entire plate full of just boiled egg crumbles and was running up and down the line with no parents in sight. Where are the parents or management/staff to control this kind of stuff? Putting hands on everything is so unsanitary, which is why I usually stray from buffets... When paying, I was shocked at the prices now. I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in about a year or so, but $28 for 2 dinners and 2 drinks at a salad bar seems way ridiculous. Another $10 or less and I could have gone to Outback and we could had some steak with our salad!\nAfter seating we went to get drinks and I was so disappointed that their tea was empty and they dont have apple juice anymore since I am not a big soda drinker. We then ventured to get some bread and soup to go with our salad. Almost all of the soups had that crusty layer on top from sitting so long. There was no butter for potatoes or bread. The foccacia and pizza bread was just the crusty outter layer that no one ever seems to take. The pastas were crusty and dry looking. So much for my appetite. After eating our salad and little bread/muffins that weren't old looking we went in for some of their gooey chocolate cake. Again only the outside rim of it was left and it was rock hard. The guy behind the counter said it would be a while before a new one was out. He just stared at the kid who was digging around the cake and using his finger to scrape the cake off the self serve spoon. Gross. We then just settled for a dry brownie muffin and ice cream. We never did take anything from the fruit/pudding bar since that was covered in kids as well and all the bins were almost empty. \nKnowing that I am pregnant and hormones are raging, I decided not to complain since it would probably turn out ugly with me either screaming or in tears. Just left hungry and disgusted. I will not be back to this location. Too bad the express location is closed now since I did frequent it all the time. Guess I will head back to the 215/Flamingo location with higher hopes. That one always seemed to hit the mark."
2,The locations in phoenix have chicken we can add to our meal. This location does not. We drove an extra 10 minutes to get here  to find out they don't have chicken was not a pleasant surprise.
0,"Never again , crab cake salad tasted like vomit , crawfish was way to plain and flavorless . Not worth my money sorry ."
2,"Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine."
3,"I have been to a Joe's Crab Shack in New Jersey, but the experience we had at the Henderson location was very surprising.\n\nFor one thing, I don't recall ever seeing the staff dancing at a Joe's. I have seen it at Johnny Rockets locations where the staff half-heartedly does performances every so often. There is a clear difference between what I have seen there and the staff at this location; the staff members here actually seem like they are enjoying themselves. If they really aren't, then they are adept at making it seem that they are. Even the \""Happy Birthday\"" routines were different from table to table. For such things that the staff is required to do regularly, I could see how difficult it is for them to be \""convincing.\"" I give them quite a bit of credit for that accomplishment.\n\nFood and service were top notch here. I would consider returning to this location in future trips to Vegas as an \""honorary local.\"""
3,Great atmosphere.  I like to visit once in a while.
3,"We went to try there Fish fry for $10.99 available Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday.\nI have to say, you get a lot of food for the money.  But the fried calamari was the best.  The plate was full of calamari & frys.  Could not finish it all.  One of has the fish and the other the shrimp.  Also comes with green beens, onions rings, hush puppies & coleslaw.  Signing up for there club also gets you $$ off coupons almost weekly."
4,Two words: KIDS SUITE!\n\nThe kids have an area all to themselves. It is cute and clean. Staff was kind and helpful. Aaron did a wonderful job before we even arrived by checking us in (as we were worried that we'd arrive too late - and lose the room)! Inexpensive stay but it feels comfortable.  Great hotel!
1,"Service is good not to be confused with great, the happy hour specials are awesome draft beer for 3 bucks you cant go wrong , clam chowder is dismal , overall it is ok , waitress could have upsold the beers and explained all the specials a little more .."
0,"A friend and I stopped here after a movie. Walked in the front door and the place was nearly empty (3:00pm Mother's Day!)\nWe were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated! Honestly, the place was half full and plenty of tables were available. \nWe asked if we could sit at a small table in the bar area (which was TOTALLY empty) and were told we would have to wait fifteen minutes to be seated.\nA little puzzled, we asked about getting food while sitting at the bar. Hostess told us that would be fine.\nWe decided to leave. Before we left I asked the Hostess , \""Why the wait? The restaurant is half full?\"" \nHer response was, \""Because my kitchen is backed up\"". I said, \""Wait, we can get food without a wait if we sit at the bar, but the kitchen is backed up and you are half full.\"" This does not make sense?\"" She just got mad so we left. Went to Sammy's Pizza in the same area, great food, great service, even a glass of champagne for Mother's Day. We called the manager of TGIF from the restaurant and asked her about the \""wait\"". She told us there was no wait and no back up in the kitchen.\n\""You need to let the hostess know there is no wait\"". Manager did not really care.\nThis place should be packed on Mother's Day-every other eatery on Sunset was packed.\nThis TGIF's is on its way to closing unless the owner gets a grip on his staff. ..Call in the Restaurant Recovery program! This staff is killing what should be a successful franchise!"
4,"KIDS ZONE! Enough said, they will babysit your children as you gamble. IM SOLD! Hotel is clean and the rooms are amazing!"
1,"This place is super sketchy! \n\nI met my friends here for lunch since it's about the half way point for her and I. We went to cabo, the waitress was excellent, the food was great... just the other customers....ah, something  interesting to see. I wouldn't come here alone at night."
3,I think for the price of the rooms it is a great place it is very clean and the costumer service is great. Wish the buffet lines weren't so long though!
3,"Never stayed in the rooms I eat there and the Grand Cafe is fab, the price is okay, the portions suits the price. However the food tastes great. \n  I don't do the buffet often but when I do I have never had any complaints. Nice selection. and if you have a Players Card you can get a good deal. \n  Yes its a casino so its smokey and there is no real non smoking place. The smoke is everywhere, its Vegas Baby.  The machines are pretty good, run when you win is my advice. Lol. \n   As for the service Its not easy to find someone to help, the cutbacks seem to still be in effect. Little tip, those guys in suits with badges, grab one. lol.\n   The Station Casinos love Locals!!!"
0,"I stayed here Labor Day weekend 2013 and had so many problems from  being given a room that was occupied , locked out of my room, no maid service, double charged on two credit cards and told that I had two rooms reserved instead of one. They offered me a free upgrade which I decided to take for the same weekend this year, Just four days before I am to leave I just got a call rescinding the same offer that they offered and set up. \n\nI was offered food and beverage comps that do me no good unless I cancel other reservations. They also offered to pick me up at the airport and that does nothing for me as a friend I am meeting is picking me up. I don't think a hotel could do any worse than last year but they topped it by ruining my vacation two years in a row. \n\nMy past stays had been good but they wiped out years of good stays with these two and I think it is time for me to stay where my business is appreciated. I would never recommend staying here to anyone for fear they might get the same treatment."
0,"Avoid this Kidsquest Boulder Station location and go for other locations at Las Vegas if possible!\n\nI was extremely dissatisfied about the child care service provided to my 19-month old baby from this center. First, during her 5-hour stay, not food nor drink was provided or attempted to be provided to my baby. My baby was crying like crazy when I picked her up. I need to give her formula immediately. She consumed it non-stop and stopped crying after that. I read the check-out form and no meal/snack/fluid was noted. Second, when I checked her in, the staff said a meal will be given to her since she will have a 5-hour stay from evening around dinner time. Obviously, it was just a lie. In addition, I was not reminded at all about the additional charge if I pick the kid up late. I was charged $25 even I was a few minutes late. Finally, the staff over there were totally unfriendly. I was treated like I have been giving them trouble. Their attribute was unacceptable and they were irresponsible for my kid's stay. I called the customer relations department and told them all these. They said they are going to research and talk to the director of this center. I will wait for their callback and may need to escalate this to Nevada Department of Health and Human Services of their inhuman treatment to my baby."
2,"BLUF: You get what you pay for.  Excessive Chip Repair = Excessive Orange Peel\n\nTook my car here to get a paint job.  I had no significant body damage other than minor chips in the paint.  I did have significant oxidation to the hood and the roof.  I was painting the car the same factory stock color.\n\nThe positive: The cars paint job is a vast improvement to what was on the car prior to the paint job.  \n\nThe negative: Massive Orange Peel all over the car!  The excessive chip repair I paid for only covered most chips according to the informative panel on the wall of the shop which they were happy to show me after I showed them the remaining \""excessive\"" chips.  In fact, I'm convinced that the excessive chip repair is done by fixing the big chips, and the smaller chips are fixed by spraying on the paint on thick which causes for excessive orange peel which help to hide the chips.  Since I didn't pay for the \""deluxe package\"", I'm stuck with the orange peel paint job.  They took off the emblems and didn't put them back on.  I asked the manager if they kept them, he said they were in the glove box.  I should have checked it before I left, but I didn't.  I came home, checked and of course they were nowhere to be found.  Contacted the manager multiple times and they have yet to locate them.  They also pained over my plastic air dam at the front of the car, which was black, but now matches the car color.  \n\nI understand that when I go to Maaco I can't expect the greatest quality.   But I feel like they didn't care about me or my car to do a thorough job to where I would feel I got my money's worth.  These guys need to know that it's the attention to detail that really impresses people enough to recommend their business to others.  Unfortunately, I cannot.  The car's badges are going to cost almost $200 to replace if they don't find them.  If they find them or replace them, I'll up my rating to 3 stars.\n\nUpdate:  They found them.  I had to show up so that they would take me seriously.  So I'm upping it to 3 stars."
0,"Horrible service!!! Why even have an appointment if you are not going to be seen for HOURS after?! This is absolutely ridiculous!  Just because I don't have the best insurance,  doesn't mean I deserve to sit around for hours! I WILL be finding another doctor TODAY! Anything is better than this!!!"
4,"Highly recommend anyone to go here!:) the staff is really nice and Dr.Goldman is a very good doctor and he's honest,prices are also reasonable. He saved my dog did surgery on her and I'm so thankful for his work!"
4,"Very polite service when I called Rakeman plumbing yesterday.  Charlie was at my house within the hour without having to pay a diagnostic fee as with two other plumbers I called.  Fantastic service, polite, efficient and knowledgeable.  Will definitely use again.  Thank you Charlie!"
3,Always excellent service and food at this location.
2,"Super disappointed w/civiche de camarones.  Seriously lacked flavor other than lime.  Nice server, loved the tableside guac & all the chips and salsa.  Entrees took forever.  Exc margarita!  I would eat there again, everyone else liked their food."
1,Slow service. I thought the food was kind of tasteless. I had to smother it in salsa to taste anything good.
4,"The hubs and I were there for dinner last night and it was amazing! The service was impeccable, the were very attentive to us, even thought there were some large parties seated near us. The servers were not wandering aimlessly throughout the restaurant, they were on a mission to please the customers and make sure that they felt as though they were the only guest in the house! Jose, our waiter was excellent, his other server-bus was literally running throughout the tables cleaning up, serving chips, and checking on tables...Our food came out in a timely manner and was excellent! The homemade flour tortillas are outstanding and the manager inquired as to how our meal was @the end of dinner and was genuine about it! It is close to nellis afb which was perfect! We may have to go back for cinco de mayo!"
4,"First of all, I live in Henderson and come to this place when I am craving authentic Mexican food. In other words, I travel about 30 minutes and pass a lot of restaurants along the way. I have tried a few dishes that have been really good, but I think I have a favorite- the pork marinated in Coca-Cola. The pork is tender (not fatty), and is covered in a sauce that will make you slap your momma. Oh, did I mention there is a lady in the back making homemade tortillas? Please remember to tip this nice lady -- she is working hard back there. The staff is friendly and attentive , and there is a good chance you will catch live music while enjoying the best Mexican food in Las Vegas."
3,"There are a couple of things that make you realize you are at a LEGIT mexican place.\n\nMenu has lots of things that you have no idea what it means\nThere is a random guy that plays a guitar in the corner\nAnd the most important : there is a chubby nice mexican lady making tortillas ..fresh ones \n\nThis restaurant was amazing. Service was impecable. Drinks , salsa and chips NEVER went below half before getting refilled.Impressive!\n\nI am not giving 5 stars because of its location. Why so far?? and why behind a truck stop?? \n\nWhat would i recommend? The coca cola steak, carne asada and the refried beans. Epic win plates!\n\nWe were a group of 12 and the food came outstanding, service was impressive, ambiance was legit and overall experience was great. Check it out !!"
4,"Fantastic atmosphere, great service and the food was delicious. I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas!  3 years later..."
3,"I think I was the only person in Vegas who has not part-taken from this hidden local gem.  I've heard all great things from everyone over the years but never had the chance to experience it.  \n\nWe met some friends there on Friday night.  The parking was a nightmare.  They had a huge section chained off where I believe alot of their customers usually park.  We ended up parking at the 7/11 and our friends had to park across the street in a vacant lot.  There was a 20 minute wait and there were people everywhere inside and outside waiting.  We decided to get a drink at the bar.  The bar is big however every seat was taken.  There were some 2 seat high tables on the side so we decided to grab one and just order drinks at the bar.\n\nSo taking a look around I felt like I took one step into Mexico.  Colorful flags draped the ceilings. The d\u00e9cor is fabulous.  I was already sold one minute into the place. There were a couple large parties which occupied a lot of their tables and a lot of their attention...which is probably reason for everyone waiting in the front.\n\nWe were finally seated and immediately served fresh chips, salsa and bean dip.  All of it was fantastic.  The warm bean dip was my favorite.  The BF and I ordered the chicken fajitas to share and the tortillas were fresh and homemade.  It was just enough food for us with all the chips we ate! ;).  \n\nAmbiance - Beautiful authentic Spanish atmosphere!  Service - as quick and attentive as they could be being there was a full house and large parties.  Food - a definite score.  And Parking - a bummer but we lived.  Overall good time had by all!  It wasn't just a meal it was an experience!  Totally whole heartedly recommended!\n\nWe will be back soon."
4,"Ate dinner here tonight. Sorry that we didn't take any pictures of our meals. The food and drinks were delicious. Especially the Queso Condido con Chorizo. Our server Ramon was excellent, and so was Osmani. Will definitely be returning. \nGood service, good food, good drinks = A GOOD TIME !!!"
0,"Went out with some coworkers last friday to chicas bonitas. We had a pretty good time,  with the exception of having to wait 20 mins for a jager bomb. I proceeded to wake up with strep, shoulda skipped the bomb. I may go back, but i will not touch the glassware"
0,Order 2 large Chilis\n2 spicy Chicken Nuggets\n2 large Drinks (Fruit Punch and Diet Coke)\n\nSimple order you would think...........NOT\n\n2 large chilis were filled only half full\nNo spoons to eat it with\nDoes Diet Coke sound like Regular Root Beer?\n\nI will keep writing reviews on this place until they change their ways. Give someone else a job if you don't want to work there.
3,"Great college! Many people resort here if they can't get into UNLV. \n\nThough it has enough credentials to educate and produce successful and driven people.\n\nOnce pass through the \""beginner\""/\""intro\""/\""101\"" classes to the upper \""pre-med\""/\""transfer\"" classes, is the change in atmosphere with the type of students. Great people who are hoping to achieve and succeed. \n\nMost the student staff are not helpful or informative, don't let them hold you back in going to this college!"
2,I ordered the 4 pc fried chicken (I think it was $5.29). It came with fries and a couple rolls. The chicken was ok. The fries were too salty. There was a lot of food for $6.\n\nYou probably want to phone in your order before coming here because it's kinda greasy inside. \n\nI'll probably come back and try their philly cheesesteak.
1,"The fried perch came pre-battered out of a box in the freezer.  The fries came out of a box next to it.  I saw the chicken strips on another table that looked like your basic freezer strips also.  The burger reminded me of my high-school cafeteria except with three times as much mustard as was necessary.  The hot wings were your standard deep fried with a sauce that I'm sure was straight from a jar.\n\nThat said, it was all pretty cheap.  However, I don't think it deserved the rave reviews.  I might try the fried chicken if I happened to be in the area but I'm not going out of my way for it."
3,"Good find in the North! \n\nFried Chicken - best tasting fried chicken I've ever had! Nice size portion for 2.\n\nCatfish - very good, just wish they gave a little more.\n\nBurgers - ok. tasted like a regular ol' hamburger to me. Which brings me to my next question, why is it called Hamburger Hut when they're burgers are mediocre as hell? Haha\n\nIt's a convenient store/restaurant. But more of a restaurant. It seems busy all the time and I hear people always ordering the fried chicken.  That's all imma get here too. \n\nParking is limited. Like, only 7 spaces limited."
0,"The only reason I am giving this a one star is because this was my second time there, and this time, they messed up on processing my credit card and charge me $84.01 for my chicken wings. the lady said she voided it, then swiped my card again and fixed the price, 5 days later it was still taken out of my bank account. My bank is going to fix this for me, but I should not have had to go through all this hassle just for these dang wings. Because of this mistake of theirs I will find another wing place. I mean what if I had needed that money for a bill or something. Get it together."
3,"Great instructors, spacious well equipped gym. My 4 yr old daughter attends weekly in the firecrackers class. I love that they have many different class times to choose from. They offer gymnastics classes for every age and experience level, cheerleading, adult gym time, parties, and different camps throughout the year. I'm so glad I found this place for my daughter, she absolutely loves coming here!"
1,This was my 3rd time trying to win any money at this place.  What a rip!  Didn't win a thing.  The sad thing is that the Station Casino's are geared towards the locals.  They don't even give any play anymore.  Just keep taking money from the people who live there to build more casino's...\n\nTwo stars for Fatburgers within the casino.
0,We are LOCALS. Station Casinos SUPPOSELY love locals. We are not pleased. We were ripped off by a bartender. I will NEVER walk into that dump again. GAME OVER.
0,"Texas Station or bust -I'LL TAKE BUST\n\nTEXSH#T Station - I use Yelp all of the time, but have never before left a review.  I am writing this one while in my room at Texas Station.  PLEASE heed my warning and don't stay here!  This place is disgusting!  There is a stench outside of raw sewage that permeates throughout the hotel and smells sooooo bad it was hard to sleep in the room with window shut and AC running.  We were forced to stay here with son's hockey team and even for one night it is AWFUL!!!!!!  Spoke to the manager and he ignored me and said I am only one who complained of the stench.  I doubt it since every parent on our team has complained when they step outside how awful the smell is.  The sink, tub and shower  have such slow drains that you are standing in 6 inches of water before you realize that yes, the drain is open!  If there was actually any water pressure, tub and sink would overflow before water drained out.    They ought to implode this place, but it is in such a bad area that no one would buy the property!  Any positive reviews are obvious plants by hotel staff.  Y'all Come Back Now - I think NOT..."
2,No bad room. Ideal size for two people with king size bed.  Looking forward to show tonight. Clean with plenty of amenities.
1,I have came here a few times to play craps.   Some of the dealers are extremely rude.. I dont know how they make it through there shift with out getting knocked out.   \nBuffet is okay..  oyster bar is great. Movie theater are decent
2,"I love this place, not sure why but hey it's Texas ;) this is simply my best buffet. They have Mexican, Italian, Asian and American...everything I like. I have always had a great dining experience at the Texas buffet and will be back, time after time!"
4,"I simply have to write about Neil Smith's Vegas Guitars Custom Shop.  I have many guitars, and have been disappointed that I could not find a high quality luthier to address setup work on instruments.  I am no longer disappointed!  I found Neil Smith using an Internet search, and found his site to be of interest, since I had a Les Paul which seemed to have some high frets, but I was too afraid to take it anywhere local.  I set up a time to bring the guitar in, you can't just 'walk in,' as his shop is small, a one man operation, plus his assistant, Susi, who is also wonderful!  When I got to the shop, I was astounded at Neil's obvious attention to detail.  He was anxious to discuss all aspects of guitars with me, and his years of experience gave me that \""warm fuzzy feeling\"" I'd never found in a Las Vegas luthier.  While I had not been expecting to have this particular guitar receive a total setup, after talking to Neil, I was convinced that that is exactly what it needed.  Not to say I was talked into something, just that his logic made complete sense to me.\n\nI was not in a hurry to get the guitar back, but I got a call in less than a week, telling me it was ready.  Now, I must tell you that this guitar already had super low action, even with the fret problem.  I had not expected that the action could have gotten any lower.  But it was, indeed, amazingly lower!  The nut slots were perfect, the frets were crowned and smoothed and look like jewelry.  It felt like a different guitar, and this from an instrument that was already outstanding!  \n\nI have taken one other instrument to Neil, a Gibson Historic Korina Explorer, and it, too, got the same setup, simply perfect!  I plan on having many more of my guitars set up by Mr. Smith.  Oh, and if you're in the market for a new, custom guitar, he does that, too.  Spectacular work, from the few of those I've had the privilege to see.\n\nIn the interest of complete transparency, after my first experience, I've since done some photography work for some of Mr. Smith's guitars.  However, this took place only after that first Les Paul was completed, and had no bearing on how well that guitar work was performed, or on my opinion of that work."
1,Staff is nice and friendly but the car wash did a terrible job. They had employees dry my car but when I got home I discovered spots all over. I'll stick to Fabulous Freddy's from now on.
0,"I was there today and there was only one person running the store. After 15min trying to find what I needed with no help I went to the check stand and there was a former employee complaining with a store associate about how bad it was to work there and that she had quit her job there, and I just wanted to buy my stuff and leave but the only checker was busy with another customer. Point is there are people who really want to work for this company and do a great job, but when employers become picky and will only hire because of  your looks or your friends or employees with benefits, the business will suffer badly.  This Petco is dying a slow death because of very bad business practices. It wont do any good to contact the EEO about this, they just turn the other way. Sorry Petco you've lost my business permanently!"
2,"This place gets a 3 star because they've never blown my socks off with anything, but I've never had experience with them that made me want to quit pizza. It's pretty close to my house and my nephew loves pizza so I'm here a decent amount. They're very consistent, very friendly and my food is always ready on time. On the single time my order was messed up, they were very quick about fixing it,  which was majorly appreciated. To be honest I have nothing bad to say about them at all. They get the job done"
0,As usual they slop a whole bunch of secret sauce so you can't taste the beef or the rest of the sandwich.  I had the new advertised Rueben and sure wasn't impressed.
4,Probably in my top 10 things I have eaten in Vegas. I love the Bobbie and probably get one every other week. I did branch out and get a Slaw B Joe and that was unreal too.
2,"This place is small, located in the strip mall on Craig, next to the Pets Mart. After picking up some doggy items my boyfriend and I stopped here to grab some sandwiches to go on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nI went in to order while my boyfriend kept our four-legged friend busy outside where they have some tables set up for out-door eating. Um, too bad it stinks outside right around the area of the store though. Definitely not appetizing to eat sandwiches around a sewer-like smell.\n\nI have given Capriotti's a 5-Star Review before, but this was kind of \""meh\"". I'm bumping it up to 3-Stars though because the Bobbie was yummy per usual. Unlike a lot of people, I'm not a regular at Capriotti's because I'm more of a Port of Subs girl for my go-to sandwich. However, Capriotti's hits the spot sometimes.\n\nThis location is tiny by the way and there's not much seating to speak of inside. Also, the set up to pay/get your sandwich/get your drinks is a little clumsy to say the least."
4,Had the carne asada burrito. Excellent service from Ernesto and Gabe. I like the fresh made chips and salsa.
0,"I currently go to LVAC but my dad goes to 24 hour fitness. When he came to town he wanted to take me to one. So we went to this one and were sad we did. \n\nFirst strike: They refused to let me as a guest try the gym without paying. Seriously ten dollars. Weird because I thought every gym had a 7 day pass to try the gym. Nope.\n\nSecond strike: He told my dad he needed to sign the parent/guardian portion of my guest paper. I was like I'm 28 and the reception guy said oh you look really young. Seriously I don't look like I'm 16. He was also very rude about it. I wanted to say \""dude not only do I get paid a whole lot more than you but I have my flippin masters so suck it\"".\n\nThird strike: I was trying to figure out out to watch the TV since there wasn't a plug in on my machine. Tried to find another employee to ask but no one was around. Of 3 of there TVs were out anyway. OH and no FANS!!!!!\n\nMy advice go to LVAC this place was so unfriendly."
1,"Also known as stab mart in the military circle this Walmart is not the best by any means. However, I must admit with the increase of security recently it has made me comfortable with once again shopping there. \nIt has been a welcome change to not have to travel all the way down Craig to the next Walmart to buy things. \n\nThis Walmart does offer some things that other Walmarts' do not normally offer. In example, around holiday times and season changes you can snag some great clearance items. They almost always have some kind of clearance specials going on in buggies along the backside of the cashier stations and have a clearance aisle behind the jewelry department. \n\nA couple of downsides to this Walmart is that the service is very limited. They have minimum cashiers and their deli department always takes forever to service you. However, the service you get is rarely bad once you get it. The people tend to be friendly.  \n\nI would also never recommend buying produce there. Their fruits and vegetables go bad super quick. During strawberry season I purchased two large flats of strawberries for a dessert I was making. The next day when I opened my 2 flats I found that 90% of my strawberries were ruined and molded toward the bottom. I had looked the day before and had not seen this. I have also had this issue with some of the bread products I have bought there so beware on fresh products. \n\nOverall, this Walmart could be better. There are some things such as cleanliness that could still be improved but in the 3 years I have lived in the area I have seen major improvements to what it was previously."
1,"I'm only giving this location 2 stars for being open 24 hours and having merchandise although I'd rather go with Eh, Me thinks NOT!  \n\nI absolutely HATE this location. I refuse to even shop here unless I am in dire need, which I make sure doesn't happen. \n\n This place is so Ghetto, it's dirty and there is no customer service. Spare yourself, if you live in this area travel over to the 215 and Decatur location which is cleaner, quiet and a lot less hassle."
4,Was recently in town on business and stopped by for lunch. Pad See Ewe Shrimp. It was amazing !!! Good portion size as well.  I liked the food so much I went back the next day and tried the Pad Thai - equally as good !!  I will definitely come back here on my next trip.
1,"This location may be too busy to get some real service.  The last couple of times I've gone my orders have been messed up.  They have two kinds of fries, but even if you ask for fat ones your getting skinny.  Don't bother asking for condiments when ordering because they are not going to be there when you get your food.  Maybe it's just too busy for them to get it right."
2,"My guy had his Christmas party here.\nWe had the dining room exclusively to us.\nWe were served buffet style. With salad, (ranch or italian) \nchicken tenders, and chicken wings (with hot sauce available)\nspaghetti, chicken Parmesan , and toast.\n\nI thought the food was fair..It was decent. The chicken was cooked well..Tender and juicy. There just wasn't any WOW factor to any of it.\n\nThe service staff was nice and attentive. However, I just think that their drinks are slightly overpriced. I ordered a margarita, which was VERY strong, and my guy ordered a beer. Some how, these two drinks came out to $11.50"
3,Sadly in this part of own there are not too many steakhouses and over time even restaurants have been going under.  This Outback's food has been consistently good and the service is always on point.
4,"Yes, you can find a cheaper tire. I like this place because they offer a warranty and a bunch of other services with your tire purchase.\n\nAnother great thing - I was literally out of there in less than 15 minutes! Extra star for their awesome service!"
3,"I just bought my third set of tires here.  The price is always good compared to other competitors, and the service is swift and friendly.  On the phone, the manager said my 4 Michelin tires would be at the store in one hour, and I would be out the door in 30 minutes.  I would receive a $100 rebate to boot.\n\nI arrived at the business in 1 hour and 15 minutes; all new tires were already there; and, despite about 10 people already in the waiting room, all tires were quickly mounted on my car and I was out the door in 29 minutes, with the $100 rebate processed online by me without any glitches within an hour after that.  So why the loss of half a star?\n\nI was asked by the manager if I had picked up a complimentary bottle of cold water, and I responded that I had helped myself to a free bottle, but it was not cold.  Although several salesmen were moving about, no one had apparently noticed that the refrigerator was totally empty; only warm bottles rested in cases on top.  As I was leaving, I saw an employee start to restock the refrigerator with water bottles.\n\nMore importantly, when my car was returned to me I noticed that visible white lines (probably from sealant) had streaked all four tires.  It took me less than 5 minutes to wash all the streaks off with water at a nearby gas station.  But it should be obvious to the service techs that when a car owner spends several hundred dollars to buy new mounted tires, he or she would like to see them looking better upon receipt than the old worn ones that were just removed.  I feel that the technicians should spend a few extra minutes making sure that the tires are properly detailed before presenting a car for return--even if that might throw off the 30-minute promise a bit.  Speed is much less important than mounting and tightening the tires properly and presenting a nice-looking final product.  \n\nI know these particular tires were all properly mounted and tightened because I just arrived intact in southern California without incident after driving at high speeds from North Las Vegas in the middle of the night (to beat the heat) following an enjoyable UYE at Settebello's in Henderson.  So, I highly recommend this store to others overall, despite the two minor gripes just expressed."
0,"DO NOT SHOP HERE!  My wife bought hair for my daughter, and the size was not what was indicated on the package.  They refuse to allow a return or even an exchange because they have a no return policy.  We are out over $100."
0,Ordered a pizza to go very light on toppings and sauce asked to reorder said no not very good customer service
4,"UNBELIEVABLE!  I'm not talking about the prices!  Forget the fact that a suit is $5 and they do it onsite!  I am a magician and have some tough suits to clean with special pockets and all sorts of stuff.  The real problem is that my suits are made of shiny material with a really tight special weave.  Stains are hard to get off.  The first time I went in they didn't notice there were a few stains that stayed on (you have to look at them in the light at an angle anyway to see through the shine of the suit sometimes.)  They happily and gladly redid it twice, until the spots were all off!  When it came time to pay (The stains and suit are my fault not theirs) they asked for $5.  I thought they were joking!  All I can say is GO HERE.  I've paid $25 to $45 at expensive places and the service was not this good!  These people are amazing!"
3,"I remember when Krispy Kreme Doughnuts opened on the west coast.  I remember these doughnut shops were found in almost every city.  One thing about a Krispy Kreme, the quality and taste is consistent.  \n\nFirst from the inside, you get to witness how a Krispy Kreme donut is actually made.  It's actually pretty cool to watch the process. Because of the assembly line process, it's no wonder why their donuts are always consistent.  \n\nService here has always been great.  When it comes to their donuts, the glazed is what they are known for.  \n\nTIP:  Whether you're going ordering inside or drive thru, request for their fresh batch. Nothing beats a fresh hot glazed Krispy Kreme Doughnut."
0,Crappy service.
2,"I recently went to this restaurant to celebrate my coworkers birthday. I have never had any problems with Applebee's; however, this particular time, I ordered the shrimp and spinach salad and found some type of plastic in my salad. Both the manager and waitress apologized for the incident and were very quick to fix the problem. I was offered a new salad (which I took to go because my coworkers had finished their meal already) and when the food was brought out to me, the manager came back again to apologize. My meal was also free. I gave them a 3 because of how both the manager and waitress quickly fixed the problem. I don't think it was their fault but rather the fault of the cooks who were preparing the foods. My salad was also very good!"
1,Wife and I had dinner on 9/18/13. Usual service was good for the establishment. We tried the new additions to the menu. I had the Honey Pepper steak and the wife had the Honey Chicken Shrimp. The honey really overpowered the dish. The steak was cooked how I ordered. I tried the wife's shrimp and thought I was eating candy. This dish will never be ordered again. The onions and jalape\u00f1os were smothered in the honey syrup. It should have been fried and placed on the steak after it was cooked. That's how it looked on the menu. On a scale of 1-10 I rate this dinner a 2. This Applebee's is In my neighborhood and we will keep going but will not be trying any new dishes especially if honey is added.
1,"Pretty bad.  I was given 2 Applebee's gift certificates, meaning I've been forced there multiple times.\n\nThe Food: It's typical Applebee's food, not great, just good...although, my coveted artichoke dip was cold last time.\n\nAlcohol:  The bartender's suck, I ordered a \""Long Beach\"" two separate times and the first time it tasted purely of tequila (WTF?), the second time I ordered it with a kicker (that the bartender recommended) but it tasted purely of sugar...and I don't mind sugary drinks but this was bad.\n\nThe Service: Probably the best part of the restaurant, very friendly in my experience (the reason for the second star).\n\nManagement: incredibly unorganized, managers clearly disliked their jobs, one told us how ghetto the clientele is...which is probably true considering some of the stories I've heard...\n\nIn essence, the food is hit or miss, the alcohol sucks, and literally most of the management hates their lives...do yourself a favor and go somewhere where there's a little TLC put into the place..."
1,"In person, the staff can seem friendly or helpful. But over the phone, they don't even bother. They've called me to show up early only to switch doctors on me. The office isn't very clean. I had hoped to never go back, but they wouldn't respond to prescription refill requests and I had to go in person to fix the situation. First they told me I would need to come in and be seen every three months for my refills, but when I began to question this they folded and gave me my prescription. They seem like they want to force you to have as much done as possible to line their pockets with your insurance (hopefully) money. I'm back to hoping I never need to go back."
4,"This FBO is about as good as it gets...especially for a county owned facility.\n\nEver since this ramp and terminal were remodeled it is the only place we have gone.  I think i have only been into KLAS once since then.\n\nMost think it is too far from the strip, but honestly it is only a 10 minute drive.  For how low the ramp fee is, and the fuel price, we are more than happy not to pay hundreds at KLAS each night just to save a 10 minute drive.  The fuel price is also worlds lower than vegas.  Even in a small jet...if you are taking only a few hundred gallons, then add in the ramp fees, we are saving around a thousand dollars every trip.\n\nEvery employee we have met is been super helpful.  The line guys are always there to help...and let me tell you, when there is a big event in Vegas this place can be hoppin and they still manage to give you a piece of attention.\n\nThe staff on the inside is helpful too.  We used to come here A LOT, but we don't make it to vegas near as often and Donna and Scott still always treat us like we are in big iron instead of just a small CJ.\n\nThey aren't open 24 hours, which has been a problem a few times, but the security officer that is on duty is one of the best i have seen anywhere.   Usually these guys are unfriendly and wont get out of their golf cart.  this guy acts like he owns the facility, and helps you out with anything he can.  It is refreshing to see someone who takes so much pride in their job.  I wish i could remember his name to give him due credit.\n\nTHERE IS NO FUEL AFTER HOURS.  this is the only negative.  We have had to make some special routing arrangements at other local airports to get fuel before we could make it home because of this.  I would say this is the only negative and honestly as long as you put in the fuel order before you leave (or call in during normal hours) it's no big deal.\n\nthere is a restaurant upstairs and their food is pretty good.  Not the best i have had, but not too shabby for a small airport place.  I had the roast beef once, and ham and cheese a couple times and both were good.   The restaurant hours are very limited though, which is annoying but that doesnt effect the FBO score since it is a seperate place.\n\nanyways, i guess the point to all this is.....why would you fly into KVGT or KLAS when you have this option??   yeah...i can't think of a good reason either.\n\nN525HS"
4,"I wanted to take off a star for the weird bendy line that I always have to wait in when I go through the drive thru. However, the truth is that if I simply parked my car and walked my lazy a** inside, I would not have to wait.\n\nSpeaking of their drive thru, wow. You could be in a line all the way out to Eastern and you would be through that line in 5 minutes. They really have an operation going on there. This is what happens when you have the budget to hire sufficient amounts of employees.\n\nOne time this one girl was kinda mean to me...but I can't blame McDonalds.  It felt like an anger caused by something such as a breakup or a stressful issue with not paying rent, so I let it go.\n\nHAVE YOU HAD THEIR FRIES?!?!!?  I don't care what people say. I think are putting crack in those. Salt and crack. If one day down the line we find out that McDonalds fries were so good because they were laced with something, I won't be shocked."
2,"I will start out with the disclaimer that I lived in Italy for 6 glorious months and, consequently, I am a total Italian food snob. I found out about this place from a friend and I was especially pleased to find them on restaurant.com. So my husband and I printed our $50 gift certificate and headed out on a Friday night. I started the meal with the best cosmo I have ever had, it was definitely strong but I didn't taste any alcohol. The bartender is masterful! I then moved on to the bread basket on the table. The regular bread was delicious and warm. There was also an herb, almost pizza looking bread that I was not very fond of, but I am sure somebody enjoys it. I did notice that other tables were getting bruschetta as well as bread, but I got the feeling they were \""regulars,\"" but it made me feel left out! We moved on to appetizers. I had the caprese salad, which has roasted peppers and onions on it. I was surprised how well the whole thing worked, given its non-traditional nature. I would definitely recommend it! For the main courses, I had the papardelle with filet and my husband had the trout special. The pasta was delightful and the filet was melt in your mouth delicious, but the dish was missing something. It was earthy and rustic but there was a flavor profile missing for sure. The trout was well cooked, but the skin of the fish was not at all crispy and we felt it should have been. It came with a side of pasta that was delicious! Since we had the restaurant.com coupon we decided to go all out and get a dessert. We decided to go out on a limb and try the Sicilian cannoli. The cannoli was almost inedible. It has an overwhelming lemon flavor and is just very off-putting texturally. \n\nThe service was wonderful, until the end of the meal. The restaurant had filled up very fast and people were asking to be seated in our server's section. The poor man was running from table to table! It took us over 15 minutes to get someone to swipe our credit card so we could leave, but other than that small ordeal the service was impeccable. Overall, it was a mixed bag for us. I have had better Italian food in Las Vegas, but I may give this another try sometime in the future."
3,"I've been here twice now and it is phenomenal. I'm so in love with pasta, and I would way way way rather eat a $20 plate of homemade pasta from a locally owned business than eat a $15 plate of Olive Garden pasta with bottom of the barrel ingredients, crapola service, and a host of corporate BS. \n\nThe first time I went was spring Restaurant Week. I have to say that I wasn't overtly impressed with the meal for the price, but I did enjoy it enough to buy the Groupon and try it again. Last night I had the fig appetizer--goat cheese, balsamic, wrapped in proscuitto ($14 for 3, noooot worth it but still good) and the butternut squash ravioli. That dish is absolutely superb. The portion size is perfect. My mom had a marsala special which was also absolutely incredible....we cleaned our plates and then some. Dessert was the tiramisu, which I didn't really have room for and didn't need, but I still enjoyed the dessert like I do. \n\nI would definitely come here again or recommend it to someone who wanted good, high-quality Italian food and didn't want to venture to the Strip for similar quality at twice the price."
2,"We had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.\n\nThere is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.\n\nWe were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.\n\nWe ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e was the winner of the two desserts.\n\nI think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price."
4,"My friend/ex-roomie and I love this spot for our QT dates. We've always had a great experience but this last one was the best by far. We had a restaurant.com certificate, so our bill for a bottle of wine, an appetizer and two entrees came to $40 each (including tip). That's a great deal for amazing food and fine dining service. \n\nWe got the eggplant app this time, and it was so good. It's like a cheesy crunchy layered veggie lasagna with light tomato sauce. We devoured it. I couldn't decide between the mezzalune or the special italian sausage and shitake mushroom ravioli so the server offered to have the kitchen make me a half order of each. I was amazed by this generous offer!  And when I got my food, I was so happy as each dish was so delicious. I ate my entire plate.  My roomie got the fettucini alfredo and she too finished her entire plate.  \n\nThis is just one of my fave restaurants when I want to splurge on calories. If you have a Groupon or restaurant.com, it's a steal for the quality of food and service you get."
2,"Way too expensive for the quality & quantity of food you get. I had purchased a groupon & we went last Friday. The place was not very busy which was surprising for a Friday night but according to some of the other yelp reviews, not unusual. \nWe ordered the calamari & fried artichokes for our appetizers. The calamari was $13 & the portion was tiny. The fried artichokes were either canned or jarred artichokes which I could not believe. At a restaurant like that, it's completely ridiculous to use any kind of canned ingredients. My husband got the veal with mushrooms & I got one of their specials, Chilean Sea Bass. My husbands veal was nothing special & the sauce had a weird texture to it. My sea bass was good but the accompanying side of orzo with different veggies in some type of sauce was very boring & unimaginative. \nVery forgettable meal & we won't be going back. I can think of at least 3 other Italian restaurants that blow this place out of the water."
1,"Dang how in the heck can you work in a theater and not know about the movies playing.  Its 2011, please stop being cheap and have paper towels in the bathroom. Popcorn was ok i should have went to Popcorn girl and brought my own(pissed i couldn't really eat it due to the smell). The only thing that was good was the movie hangover 2. I enjoyed the movie but since it was packed and some *ick-head had his feet all on my seat. (yeah i gave him the eye several times but I guess he was to dum to figure out  the deal-he got me on a good night). The smell was so foul he had my eyes and nose burning. (Man he needs to spray some big Oomp spray or something on those dogs, and the theater @the same time.) All and all i may need to continue to drive to fiesta or go early on tuesday.  \n\nThey better be glad i don't know any movies man around here- because I could have gotten the 2 for 1 deal on the streets.(jk)"
0,"Overpriced with a moody staff. Far more expensive then south point with bad service.  It was dead when I went, and for good reason. GVR is the only theatre I've ever had problems with the staff. Plus it's ridiculously over priced (even though all theatres are) at most theaters it's about 45$ for me and my boyfriend to see a movie and get snacks but here it was 55$ and we didn't even get candy. My boyfriend got a hot dog that the staff shoved into the bag so the bun got all ripped up and they shorted him on his 6$ small drink. It had an inch and a half of space left when he recieved it. I wouldn't normally care that it wasn't all the way full but when you pay 6$ for a drink you expect it to be filled. Then the girl checking us out had no people skills and kept looking at us like she wanted us to leave.  But we finally get into the movie and it's a good movie but the usher kept patrolling constantly through the movie and he was distracting. He walked through the theater at least 4 times clicking his counter each time. The movie was great but I don't think I'll be back at GVR again I'm gunna stick with south point and save 10$ and not have to deal with an usher who doesn't know how to do his job well enough to not distract people from the movie they payed good money for. It might have been nice and clean but the service was severely lacking."
3,"Fast cheap Mexican food. Very addicting. Love the chicken bowl from there. Pretty decent healthy option as well, as long as you don't add the sour cream and cheese. Only problem I have with Chipotle is that the amount of food you get each time is different, depending on the server."
1,"We love Chipotle and this location used to be a great weekday lunch destination. Lately we've tried it on the weekends and probably won't go to this location anymore. The food is still OK, but the service has gotten slow and the restaurant is generally messy or they let the fountain drinks run dry. One time we had to stand and wait while an employee held up the whole line as she ordered food for her family members - and for some reason this confused the rest of the staff and they had to re-make a couple of other customers' orders. Maybe they don't have a weekend manager? Not sure. The location on Las Vegas Boulevard & Warm Springs is where the A-Team workers are. We'll keep going there instead."
1,"This is the worst chipotle that I have been too! The service wasn't all that good, and the portions were the smallest I've experienced. \nThe chipotle Location on Sahara is much better!"
4,I have to admit I have minimal yoga experience (basically prior to this I just did the p90x yoga video.). I just go to the beginner classes and they are great. The classes aren't so packed that the instructors don't get time to come over and help with your poses (trust me I always get special treatment as I'm particularly retarded.). I go primarily for relaxation but I always end up with sweat pouring off of me. Highly recommended!
4,"Found this place on Yelp by accident and what a happy accident it was!  Arrived around 7:30 on a Friday night and there was a very short wait. We waited in the front by where they make pizzas and that was interesting to watch - also looked delish.  We got the last table in the back which was very cozy, warm bread with olive oil and vinegar to dip,  Waiter Dave Z was delightful and joked with us throughout the meal, as well as being very attentive.  Wine all around - now we were set to read the menu.\n\nI had the Chef's signature eggplant and it was outstanding.  My husband had the penne pasta with broccoli and chicken, which was also excellent.  My friend had spaghetti with meatballs which was very good, too.  But my friend Coleen had the sausage and mushroom rigatoni which was out of this world.  All the portions were heaping and I was amazed to see her all but finish it - I have NEVER seen her eat that much!!  She's an awesome cook in her own right and could not stop saying how incredible this dish was.\n\nThe owner came over and shared some of his thoughts and stories about his business - this was truly like having dinner with an extended family.  We are sad that this place is over 2 hours from home but we plan to stop in each time we have to visit Vegas.  Had no room for cannoli so we took one home and shared it for breakfast.  Yummmmmmm.\n\nHere's the hard part - I easily give this place 5 stars and that's uncommon for me.  Usually something about the restaurant turns me off or isn't what I thought it should be.  Not Buon Gusto.  And if I give it 5 stars then I'll have a longer wait next time I go because all of you want to try it, too.  Hmmmmm.  My karma would be all FUBAR if I gave this place anything less than a five - so have at it!"
4,"I come from a big Italian family and I am grown to my family's cooking. I must say that it is very difficult to find a place that serves food as good as Buon Gusto. I have been to so many restaurants throughout my life. I lived on the east coast and the west coast and been to so many places that just served mediocre food. Some of it was good, but not great. I remember my cousin went to Buon Gusto and she told me about it. She said to me that she could not believe how authentic-tasting the food was, and how it was just like our family's cooking. My mom is such a wonderful cook so I know the difference between Italian food and great Italian food. Everytime I come here, everything is on the money. Every detail, ingredient, and server is incredible. The place is so welcoming, warm, and so intricate. The food is TO DIE for. And I don't know about you but if the food is this good, I don't care how much I pay for it. This place has yet to disappoint me or anyone that I recommended it to. I honestly feel like I am eating right out of my mother's kitchen. Incredible food and service, and I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great quality and great, authentic Italian food. You will not be disappointed at all. I will be coming here for as long as I am in Vegas. There is no other Italian place in Vegas that can fully incorporate true  quality Italian food the way these guys can."
3,"Finally had the time to try this place since it's been in my bookmarks for quite a while. It has a really casual feel to it and was really clean. Their menu had a lot of different options of pastas, entrees, pizzas, salads and sandwiches including 8 lunch specials for $8, Tuesday- Friday, 11-4pm. I wanted to try them but I  was craving pasta and for some reason I'm really weird and feel like if I have pasta without any meat/chicken (what all their pasta lunch specials were ), I feel like my meal is incomplete. I know I know, I'm weird lol. Sooo I ended up trying the sausage and mushroom rigatoni and my boyfriend tried the chicken trieste. It took a little long, about 20 minutes for them to come out when there was only us and another small table dining. Oh and all entrees come with a salad and fresh baked  bread but just like Jill D. said in her review they didn't bring us any bread so we asked for it since my boyfriend's entree didn't come with any pasta and he needed something to soak up all the delicious sauce! Definitely ask for it if they don't bring you any, it's a little bread loaf of perfection; warm, chewy and comes with garlic evoo! Yum Yum!!  The main thing I was surprised about and not expecting were their rich and creamy sauces and the fact that they definitely were not skimpy with it or their ingredients. And thank goodness their sauces actually stuck onto the pasta and didn't slide right off.  Usually when I order a type of sausage pasta in other places,  I'll get like 5 pieces of sausage perfectly placed on top and we call it a day but this pasta here was LOADED!!!! I feel like there was 3 links of chopped sausage in there and same with the mushrooms! The pasta also was cooked well, not too mushy or too hard. Sometimes I feel like Goldilocks describing porridges lol but really, it was \""just right\""! :) My boyfriend's dish was also a little plate of perfection! The flavor of the sauce was just soo delicious! Yes I know, I'm sprung on their sauces lol. It had a really nice wine flavor and was loaded with artichoke hearts and mushrooms on top of two chicken breasts. \nWhy is there missing one star you ask? Well, it's because of the service. Everyone was really nice and professional yet I had to request our waiter to fill my water after waiting a few minutes and after he visited our table and didn't notice. I also had to request for the bread. I hate requesting for things, I mean if it says it comes with it, then just bring it out! I also had to request extra silverware when he took it away with our salads but didn't bring any new ones to us with our entrees. However, we didn't have to request our check lol. Don't get me wrong, these people weren't just standing around being lazy, they were all doing tasks and were hard working  but you can't forget about your customers! Overall, better than I expected and will definitely be back especially for the price! :)"
0,"Chicken(Country)-Fried Steak, To Go!\nDrive Home took approximately 45 seconds. Upon opening container and cutting first piece, the entire breading-type covering, which was over and inch thick, completely came off the McDonald's Hamburger-sized beef patty. I even had gravy on the side, so it wasn't soggy from the gravy. \n\nAre you kidding me? How difficult is it to fuck up a Chicken Fried Steak?\n\nTotally ruined and a waste of time & money. Threw it away!"
0,"We asked for table side guacamole and our waiter said \""I'll make it for you then bring it out\"" then I said \""no, we want TABLE SIDE GUACAMOLE\"" he again said \""trust me on this. .. I'll make it for you then bring it out and I won't charge you the table side price.. we are too backed up in the kitchen.\"" I told him to go tell his manager what he told me or I was going to tell him.... judging by the managers reaction when he came to our table... he most likely told all his servers to do this on their shift. Eat at the one on Las Vegas Blvd or go elsewhere."
0,"Yikes,  the memories of DQ.  You know, ice cream, treats, a nice nostalgic feeling of the past for kids.  What happened to this place?  I haven't a clue.\n\n1.  Ambiance - Been here several times now, and always the same, bland, not exciting.\n\n2.  Service - Hmmm, perhaps they should turn this one to a self service facility, this would definitely improve the service. A guy was there waiting for his kids sundae. The servers assisted and prepared orders for two other customers that came in after. The guy goes to the server to remind them, they said it was almost ready. Then I put my order in, the guy starts to make mine and I remind him about the guy's kid from three orders ago. So, they start to make it and it takes like 10 seconds. Poor kid.\n\n3.  Service Part 2 - they make my order and the shakes are like slightly thicker than milk. I said no whip and guess what, whip. I ordered one dipped cone and guess what, i got two. I guess you can say that this ying yang approach is balanced???\n\n4.  Air Con - What the heck happened here? No air, no fans, hot and stuffy?  Hmmm, what would a normal store do? Offer free dipped cones!\n\n5.  Service Part 3 - to use the toilets, you have to get a key from the cashier. Guess what, they cannot find the key.  I wonder what the dealio is since this place is usually empty anyway, no need to manager the bathroom.\n\nThis is not a bad place, the cones and stuff are decent, but the service and customer care is not in existence."
0,What a mess. \nAfter making my pumpkin blizzard. They tried to use a regular soda lid on the large then forgot the whip cream.  Next after asking for whip they forgot the pumpkin spice.  Asian guy working was on the side using his cell.  \nHad to ask for the spice in another container so I could put it on the blizzards myself for the kids.  \nWtf?????  It was soo freakin messy and it looked like an ice cream shoved into a cola container at first. \nThis place needs a serious employee training so they know never to serve something with less quality to the customer.
2,"Fado seems to be the default hangout for my friends and I.  Basically, if we can't think of anywhere else to go, and we don't want to think too hard about it, we go to Fado.  It's close and it's not too pricey.\n\nThe beer selection is not fantastic, as far as I'm concerned.   I end up drinking cider half the time, which is a far cry from the usual ambers I tend to enjoy.  The do have Smithwicks, which is a decent amber, but not much else I'm excited about.  Of course, they've got the British/Irish kinds of beers, but not as many as I'd like to see.\n\nTheir happy hour appetizers are very good, and fairly cheap.  The crab and cheese dip is tasty, as are the beef curry bites and the guinness mac and cheese (all are 3-5 bucks).  \n\nOh, yeah, FYI, there is absolutely nothing healthy at all on the entire menu, so...be aware if you're into that kind of thing.  Tasty, but not healthy.\n\nThe ambiance here is nice, and it's what keeps me coming back.  The bartenders and servers are very friendly, and there's a laid back vibe about the place.   Basically, it's as close to a decent neighborhood Irish pub I'm going to get in Henderson."
2,"I've been to see a lot of urologists.\nA lot.\n\nI'm not a fan of male doctors, but it seems that most of the urologists or kidney specialists in this town are men.\n\nI attempted several times to set up an appointment or consultation using the web form on the website, and never received anything...not a call or an email.\n\nI called on Thursday, after noon, and was able to schedule an appointment for Monday. \n\nWhen I arrived, the staff was polite, and quiet.  \nThe paperwork was a bit much...I was literally filling in paperwork for a half an hour, but I understand that new doctors need to get information.\n\nThe nurse was nice, and made me feel comfortable while I was getting my bladder ultrasound done.\n\nDr. Kaplan was nice.  He seemed a little abrasive at first, but later it seemed he was more...appalled at the fact that previous doctors hadn't done much to help me.\n\nHe's the first urologist to offer me a preventative antibiotic, since I get frequent UTIs.  I'm not 100% sold on taking an antibiotic every day, just because of super bugs, etc, but at least he offered.  No other doctor has done that.\n\nHe's also the first to offer me a medication to help with the other bladder issues I've been having, that are starting to cause problems with my job.  \n\nHis office staff filled in paperwork for me, for help with work.  The woman I worked with was absolutely wonderful.  \n\nI like the office.  I'm not in love with them yet, but I'm always VERY cautious about feeling out doctors and their staff.  I have a follow up appointment next month, so we'll see how they do then, too."
0,"So you're not into gambling and you're not much of a shopper and you're looking for something equally as wasteful to do with your last $20 or $40, set up an appointment at this dermatologist office! \n\nI'm pretty sure the only thing redeeming about this visit was the front office staff that checked me in (shocking for a doctor's office, I know). \n\nI merely wanted to check in with my epidermis, being the sun bather I tend to be in the summer months, I made my appointment. I showed up early and they were able take me in early which was fantastic. \n\nLet's just say that I have sneezed and it has lasted longer than the time the doctor spent \""evaluating\"" my flesh. \n\nUnless your face, or body is covered in undefinable matter, painful to look at or abnormal in a major way, don't waste your time or cash at this joint. \n\nNo care, no time and no concern was shown to me during this visit; rolling down my car windows and letting go of the $40 would have even sufficed as a more rewarding experience in my opinion."
1,"Not very impressed. The crust tastes like something you would get from a bargain frozen pizza. The sauce was not very flavorful and didn't have any spices to it. I had to add a bunch of crushed red peppers to get some kick into it. The cheese was good and tasted real, but the mushrooms seemed like they were from a can. $23.78 for a 13\"" medium pizza to go, was way more than this was worth. Disappointed."
3,"What a great pizza!! We had the thick crust pepperoni, sausage and garlic pie with a couple of appetizers. First appetizer was \""Bosko sticks\"", they are cheese filled bread sticks topped with garlic seasoning and served with marinara for dipping. The second appetizer was an order of chicken wings. Every thing was great, pizza was very flavor full with crispy crust. The Bosko sticks were great and the chicken wings were cooked perfectly.  If it was closer to my home I would be a regular for sure. I do agree with some on here about the price how ever, 65 bucks for an 18\"" pie two orders of the cheese bread sticks and 12 wings!!!!  OOFFF"
1,"Went here for drinks on a Saturday night and the place was not extremely busy but for some reason it was like pulling teeth to have my beer filled.  Maybe the bartenders were having an off night but after 5 minutes of the bartenders walking by i had to flag them down for a cocktail.  \n\nWe ordered 12 of the boneless wings that came out extremely quickly...maybe 2 quickly.  The chicken totaly dry, the sauce didn't even seem present.  Perhaps said chicken had been from a previous order or cooked before ordered. \n\nIf you're just looking for a place to watch a game and do not care about service, food, and drinks this would be a great choice as they did have many games on."
3,"My boyfriend and I were torn on where to go for a bite to eat and have a casual nite out.... and we decided Buffalo Wild Wings- this was a great choice! We had a fun time! We sat at the bar and Jason was our bartender/waiter, he was great! We had great conversation, and then my boyfriend and I were able to play the silly trivia game they have and enjoy some good competition. The food was good, but chicken wings are their specialty here- so they know how to make them!"
3,"Hubby and I happened across this place while I was 7 months pregnant and seriously craving some good Chinese eats. We didn't want to go far from our new house, and we found a coupon on our doorstep a few days earlier for free egg rolls with a $10 order, so we thought we'd give China A Go Go a try. Thank heaven for pregnancy cravings!! This is our new go-to Chinese place. Everything is hot fresh and tasty. \n\nThe Hot Garlic chicken is my favorite, and they even substituted vegi chowmein for one of our white rices. Nice!! The Chicken Mu Shu is super yumm, and their prices are on point. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. :)"
0,SHUT DOWN as of 3/31/2014 by Southern Nevada Health District for having 46 outstanding demerits. I will most likely never eat there again.
0,"These people butchered our poodle. If I could add a picture to show you how terrible she looks, you would think that these groomers had no formal education and I brought the dog to supercuts for $10 trim. \n\nWe will be taking the poodle to another groomer to fix her haircut and for them to shave the spots that Hap E staff missed. \nThe poor dog is sleeping underneath a pile of blankets because I'm sure it was a traumatic experience and she is exhausted. \n\nThe Rottweiler that we brought was fine, because she just got a bath. Don't go here. If there was a zero star possibility, they would get it.\n\nF rating and the business is run by a bunch of no-talent hacks."
0,Never once has my prescription been ready when I'm told it's supposed to be.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm told it's going to be 10-15 minutes. I don't have time to sit around and wait with two kids in the car. I so wish I wasn't pigeon holed into using this pharmacy. I miss Walgreens!!!
3,"I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :("
4,"Our son was never interested in any sports.  When a friend invited him to an open house at Rico's he really enjoyed it.  For this summer we thought we would give him a few weeks to decide if it was for him.  On his first day of instruction it was clear it meant he fit in somewhere and was welcomed.  Now he's learning respect and honor and his behavior has really improved.  He is not only learning self defense but gaining the confidence that will keep him from being a target to be picked on.  He comes home from school every day with the focus to work on his studies so he can get to class at Rico's Martial Arts.  I could go on and on about the many things our family has gained in such a short time with Ricco's help, but what I love most is how all the instructors and even the parents of all the kids are so pleasant and really make your whole family feel like you are part of something great for all the kids."
3,"It has become quite difficult to find an old school barber shop that uses straight razors.  I'm an old school kind of guy.  It's a haircut, not a spa day.  I don't need my hair massaged and shampoo'd or any of that junk.\n\nVillage Barber does a good job.  I've had 3 different people and all have been fine.  An older gentleman, a man in his forties, and an Asian woman.\n\nRating a barbershop can be kind of hard as everyone who walks in the door has different needs.  But yeah, no problems with this place at all.  The price is reasonable.  The only downside I can think of is that they don't take debit or credit cards."
0,"just ate here tonight. this place sucked big time. everything was so soggy! first off the diet coke was flat and too much syrup. my friend ordered the caterpillar roll and the rice was so soggy. i ordered the cali roll and yuck....too much rice vinegar & crappy fake crab meat....the tempura i could not believe they served me what they did.... the tempura was not crispy at all, it was mushy, almost like it wasn't cooked all the way! the oyako donburi was aight but too much rice and not enough chicken! this place is outrageously over rated! will not go back. Brians Beach is da bes if you want fresh ass sushi!"
2,"I was craving sushi, my fiance was craving teppanayki so Osaka seemed like the perfect place to have both. \n\nI liked how they seemed to purposely make sure each teppanyaki party got it's own table and chef. This could have been because they were mostly empty, but I did appreciate having our own table. \n\nSushi was just OK. It was tightly rolled and they had a nice selection, but the negi hama I had was just OK. Not rotten, not super fresh.. just eh. I did love, however, that they offered half rolls. It was great to be able to get some variety. For ~$15 I was able to try 3 1/2 rolls.. this worked out really well. The rolls with all cooked stuff (shrimp tempura, etc) were great.. but that's hard to screw up. \n\nTeppanyaki was pretty good. Filet mignon was off the hook - seriously the best steak I've had at a  teppanyaki place..very tender and cooked really well. The chicken, sadly, was random end pieces and not too great. Lots of chewy grisley pieces.. eww. The fried rice and veggies were just average. \n\nOverally not a *bad* place , but nothing special. As teppanyaki and sushi are pretty expensive, I'd probably only come back here for the lunch specials. I'm not sure the quality justifies the dinner prices."
2,"Love the teppen grill lunch special! Lunch special comes with salad, soup, fried rice, and your choice of chicken or beef all for $8.95! Definately a good cheap lunch and fillllling! \n\nAs for sushi: MUST HAVE: Roppongi, and Oh My God rolls, they are amazing, other good ones include japanese lasagna and 911 rolls. \n\nSushi can get a little pricey compared to most other places, if you drink definately try the lychee saki! Really good!\n\nSIGN UP FOR THEIR EMAIL TO RECEIVE AN INSTANT 10% OFF.  For larger groups definately worth it!"
3,"Found this restaurant a few years ago when I moved to this area of town. I'm glad to have found a Japanese restaurant actually owned by Japanese! Most of the Japanese places here in Vegas are run by Koreans, which I can't complain about, but I like the authenticity of REAL Japanese food like my mom makes! :) Osaka was also the first Japanese owned restaurant in Vegas!\n\nI love the late night menu. Since Osaka is open until 2am and I'm up late, it works perfect for me! The late night menu is large with great prices! Half size/priced suchi rolls, low priced apps, and great drink specials as well! \n\nSome of my favorite items are: udon, zaru soba, shabu shabu, katsudon, katsu kare, and their selection of fish! Their soups and sauces are very good and similar to how my mom makes!\n\nThe sushi chefs are very nice, friendly and Japanese. They are great at recommending menu items and love how creative they are. \n\nThey feature teppanyaki (table grilling) and tatami tables by request and live music certain days of the week."
0,We are regulars here. On may 2. 2014  our usual party of five showed up for my sons birthday. Now we love eating here but as we were seated in the back at the teppan table a large cockroach crawled out from the side of the grill and headed toward my daughter....the manager just smiled said he would kill it and moved us to the next table! No offers of any kind followed! This was disgusting and will surely end our  twice monthly dinners there-gross!!!
4,Best green tea! Garlic tuna nigiri. Yellowtail w ponzu n jalape\u00f1o nigiri. Wild salmon. Best spicy tuna rolls. Asakusa roll is redic! Dessert great too!!!
3,"Stopped in with a group of 5 guys who love this place.  We basically told the sushi chefs to have at it and make whatever...everything that came was very good.  Sashimi was very fresh, rolls were excellent with some interesting flavors and the sushi chefs were very fun.  If I could find this place again, I'd certainly come back for the creations."
4,"Great sushi, first place i goto when i get into town, all you can eat is awesome. The staff make you feel wecome and also give some great suggestions if you cannot make up your mind from the vast selections of roll's"
1,"Average food. Lack presentation, ingenuity, and tasty. Taste like something I've picked up from a grocery store."
2,"Looking for a good place to go when you're craving authentic Mexican food but don't want to pay high prices at some Mexican sit-down restaurant or pay really cheap prices for questionable Mexican fare at a fast-food establishment? Search no further because Fausto's is that place plus more. The employees are nice, the food is made-to-order, the menu is simple and inexpensive, and there's a complimentary condiments bar complete with pickled veggies (jalapenos, carrots & onions), fresh cucumber & radish slices, and two types of salsa (mild tomatillo & a spicy red salsa). Sure, the ambiance may be lacking, but that's okay because you can just order your food to-go. You can order food a la carte (located on the menu above the counter) or you can order a combo which comes with an entree and sides of Mexican-style rice & refried beans. The combo menu is posted on the side wall adjacent to the counter, and it is composed of images of the food, making it easier to choose what you want to eat. I've been here multiple times, and everything that I have ordered so far has been good. Here's what I've ordered:\n\nChimichanga combo plate: A humongous flour tortilla burrito stuffed with shredded beef, onions & bell peppers, then fried to golden perfection and topped with sour cream on one half & guacamole on the other, along with a nice layer of melted cheese. The plate comes with a side of rice & refried beans, as well as a small serving of pico de gallo ( I assume to bring some sort of healthy to the dish). \n\nShredded Beef combo plate: The shredded beef is the same concoction as the shredded beef inside the chimichanga, but instead of it being encased in a fried tortilla, the meat is served all by itself with sides of refried beans & rice, and your choice of freshly made corn or flour tortillas, which you can use to make mini burritos. The tortillas are wrapped in foil to keep warm. I prefer the flour tortillas over the corn because they have better texture, are bigger & taste better. Store-bought flour tortillas can't compare to the fresh-made tortillas at Fausto's. \n\nSuper Nachos: Heart-attack on a plate! But so addicting & super good. I usually ask for the toppings (meat of your choice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes & cheese; I may be forgetting something) on the side to prevent the fried flour tortilla chips from becoming soft. The chips are oily and they layer on the toppings, so be warned- Addicting, yet so bad for you. \n\nTacos: I love the tacos because of the way Fausto's prepares the shell. I think they fry the whole taco after stuffing the tortilla with meat & cheese, resulting in a very crispy shell. They then take the fried taco and add lettuce & a another type of cheese (crumbly, reminiscent of feta). I like to add salsa to the taco, which makes the taco juicy & yummy. \n\nI haven't had a bad experience with Fausto's yet, so I do recommend this place. The next time you're searching for good Mexican food at inexpensive prices and large portions, then stop by Fausto's and try some of their menu items."
4,I know I gave Roberto's 5 stars but Fausto's is way better. They are just a lot farther away from my house. I love their carne asada and chips and cheese. Great place for a quick bite of tasty and blessedly unhealthy Mexican food.
0,"f I could give them no stars I would, but for the sake of the rating system, one star it is.  While I did like their selection of glasses, the place has less than mediocre service.  The doctor's appointment was fine.  All I wanted to know was if my glasses prescription needed to be increased.  The final bill was for more things than what I needed, which meant I paid for more than what I'd hoped to receive.  Also the glasses I purchased are transition polycarbonate lenses.  Up until a year into it, they were fine.  Since then the transition film has become covered in tiny cracks covering the entirety of both lenses.  Naturally they only guaranteed their work for 1 year.  \nBeware of the transition lenses from this place.  Do your research first! Transitions Optical, the company that created these lenses that darken in sunlightt, says you should get a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase and are warrantied by Transitions Optical for two years.  I did not receive a certificate of authenticity.  The multitude of tiny cracks going across my transition lenses make things appear blurry, as if I weren't wearing glasses!   I wouldn't advise doing business here.  Although I still like the frames, I'll get my lenses replaced elsewhere and make sure the customer service is better if I should have problems later!"
4,"Staff are very friendly and pleasant. Doctor genuinely cared and did not rush through the appointment . Great eye ware selection, a little pricy, but you get what you pay for. I highly recommend doing business with Seven Hills Vision Center. The office is clean and inviting. I have only one suggestion, and that is to repair or replace the carpet behind the front desk, this is the first thing I noticed when walking in the front door. Everything else was great and state of the art equipment was maintained and in good condition.\n\nIt's great when a business gets it... Customers just want to be treated with respect I know a few businesses that could learn this basic philosophy.\n\nCheers,"
0,The apartments are very nice but the management rips you off!! It's not worth the money to be there.
2,"Even trying to make an appointment at almost any of the locations never seemed to work with my schedule. ..so I did a walk in at this location while in the area for work. It felt crowded and people kept coming in with appointments, pushing me back in line but it wasn't all that long of a wait. The clinic is small and seems unkept, but the workers I encountered were all nice and did their jobs well. I used the bathroom while I was there...it was in need of a cleaning."
3,Played this course on day 1 of our 3 day golf adventure for 2013.  \n\nRate we paid was $199.  \n\nCourse has a nice layout just 25 min from the Strip with some scenic views from a bunch of the holes!  Much of the course looks like it could have been a rock quarry!  Lots of nice homes wrapping around the course.  Some challenging terrain!  A very nice Rees Jones Design!\n\nHole # 7 is the Million dollar hole challenge.  Basically you place a wager and if you get it on the green your money is doubled in pro shop gift certs.  If you get a hole in one then you come back for a second chance to hit for a million!  \n\nOnly challenge for us playing was that we were behind a slow group!  \n\nCheck out the Tee mates program if you want a sexy girl riding with you replacing your divots and raking your bunkers all day! :)\n\nOtherwise a great round!
2,"As a restaurant owner, I am always looking for places to get food/supplies. This place is good for some things, but not for others. Do not go for beverages. There is no deal whatsoever here. Really? A case of vitamin water for $32? It's cheaper buying per bottle at the grocery store with a rewards card. U usually can find deals at Vons, Smiths, etc. for like 10/$10. However they do have items that you can't find at those places like 50lb bag of flour, deep fryer oil, and paper products like take-out containers, 18\""x1000' aluminum foil and quantities of cups etc. Their BBQ sauce selection is a bit lacking, but I am a BBQ sauce freak. The condiment aisle is my favorite one in a grocery store. On the plus side, no membership is needed. It's definetly worth a trip. I will be going for the paper goods."
4,"Came here because dog became sick while driving from LA. Gave great, friendly service. Walked in but did not wait long to be seen. Got examined, medicated, and bloodwork all done within an hour. Reasonably priced too."
4,"Reviewing an animal hospital is a challenge, but so necessary! I've never been a fan of hospitals that have a multitude of vets on staff because of the impersonal atmosphere but several years ago, when my pet was sick, I felt it best to have several vets available to give second opinions. Could not have made a better decision with choosing Sunridge!\n\nWe have gone through it all here and, no matter what doctor we see, we have been happy owners. Our primary vet is Dr. Snead (who reminds me of a sensitive Chris Rock) but we have had several mini-emergencies where Dr. Rosa tended to our care and she is FAB too (reminds me of Chef Lorena Garcia a bit). \n\nAbout 9 months ago, we had a BIG emergency...hesitant that the Animal Emergency Center would charge us thousands I took a chance and called Sunridge at 9pm - the answering service was on the line and 20 minutes later an emergency doctor was unlocking the front doors and provided stiches and xrays - having us to return the next day for payment and follow up, etc. WOW! Unbelievable!\n\nA few flaws is that it is generally crowded with staff frantically swapping computer terminals, no separate entrances for dogs/cats/exotics (yes, they service exotics), and sometimes it takes a minute for your payment to be processed and file to be found. But the care you receive in exchange is worth it!"
4,"I honestly never thought it was possible for a gas station to get 5/5 stars. I really didn't, but this place is great. \n\nThe staff here is super friendly...every time you walk in you're greeted with a \""hello\"" or some other salutation. In addition to everyone just being nice, the store is oddly clean, INCLUDING THE BATHROOM! I have never been into a cleaner gas station bathroom...EVER! I always stop into this gas station on my way home from Henderson to Los Angeles, and I will continue to do so.\n\nIf you are driving down St. Rose and need to fill up, grab a drink, or just \""walk the dog\"", this is definitely the place to stop!"
2,"I have to give it an extra star for not being McDonalds... Panda is average at best. I love their orange chicken, but sometimes it can sit there too long and it becomes in edible. Service at this location is hit or miss and usually the early afternoon is the best time to go... Sucks if you really felt like going for dinner."
3,"3.5 stars\n\nIt's fast asian food so what can I really say that you don't already know?  Their new dining room is very nice, comfortable, and clean.  They have outdoor patio seating, which is cool.  Decent options as far as entrees go and I've never had any surprises in my chicken lol.  I think it can be a little expensive for what it is and the fried rice is a bit bland.  But when I'm looking for something quick but different than the typical burger, this place is a strong option."
2,"We used to go here all the time, but then we found out how much cheaper it was to shop at Walmart.\n\nAll in all the service has been pretty good at this location, but the last few times I have gone in it looks to be a whole new crew... Wonder how that's going?"
4,"I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease (Intolerance to Gluten) in December of 2010 and the first thought that came to mind was \""Oh no, how  can I receive the Holy Eucharist?\"" St. Francis of Assisi has gluten free hosts! I was so happy to hear that, because lets be honest, during cold and flu season we are hesitant to receive the wine. Talk to the sacristan about 10-15 minutes before mass, tell them you need a gluten free host. The thing is, is that you must receive it from the priest because the Eucharistic ministers don't carry it, and you must sit on the right hand side of the church to ensure you get the priest. Nice parish, nice people, and gluten free hosts, are a win -win in my book. :)"
3,"On my previous visit to this Starbuck's, they were experimenting with Dutch seating (a large table). Obviously it did not work. The upshot is that this Starbucks got another makeover. There are now four seating arrangements: 1. square tables, 2. a bar facing the shopping center, 3. cushion chairs arranged in a circle, and 4. an outdoor patio. Regardless that this cafe is over six years old, everything appears new."
2,Nice location with tough parking and a great patio. Staff is friendly but this location is pretty packed.
4,"Love Love Love. There's not much to be said. If you make my coffee good I will love you forever. end of story.\n\nSuper fast service, clean quiet environment. They never make a mistake. I got free coffee from their drive through TWICE =-) because they said I waited too long. Thank you!!"
4,"We came here for an informal inexpensive meal with another couple. Normally I get the Cuvee salad when I come to Winchells . But tonight they had a Tuesday night special for chicken fajitas for just $11. I couldn't resist. They brought out a huge portion of chicken, stir fried vegetables that are typical for fajita. They also had a very large portion of guacamole, sour cream, beans with melted cheese, and slices chili peppers. The portion was huge. I wasn't able to finish even half despite the fact that I came in hungary. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. The combination, in the tortilla (still warm), was excellent. As good as anything I've had in a Mexican restaurant. All of this for just $11. A great deal. I certainly will come back."
1,Trying to figure out why they charged me $14 for two pairs of dress pants. They did offer me a 10% off coupon bringing the total down to $12.60. Still not good enough.
4,"Nothing Short of a Miracle!! \nI had a beautiful, very expensive, cashmere sweater that had 3 holes from a moth. Two of the holes were fairly large. I thought it was ruined, I was heart-broken as replacing it was not an option.\nVillage East Cleaners not only repaired it so no one can tell (and I mean not even me) that there was ever a problem but they reassured me it would be alright when I called worried the repair would be unsightly if not weaved properly. \nThese are talented people who know their craft. Do yourself a favor go see them for your most precious alterations/repairs!"
3,"My first time at a Carrabba's and it surprised me in quality and service.\n\n The dough wasn't good for the pizza, and instead of serving sub par stuff to my friend the GM came out and explained what happened and offered any other entree. It was classy and put a restaurant that can get mixed in with other mid-grade italian places that extra star. We came on Wine Wednesday and had the Sangria which was delicious."
1,My sister and I took my mom out for her birthday.   They changed their menu  not happy about the new menu.   We had asked our server to do something special for her birthday and never did.  The service was not great either.
1,Service was descent but the crab cakes were burnt! This was my first time here and will most likely be the last. The waitress saw that my crab cake was completely black on the bottom. Obviously they put the lesser burnt side facing up hoping that I wouldn't notice. The rest of the food wasn't much better.
0,"Monday at 9:30 pm is when I walked in with my date.  They close at 10:00pm this night.  Two (2) of Carrabba's employees sees us waiting at the host stand, just stares at us for a monument and walks away as if they contemplated whether to greet us or not.  My date and I wait a little longer while few more employees walk around us without any acknowledgement.  So we decided to seat ourselves.  Another customer that was leaving aided us with the menu.   After sitting, the first employee that recognized us at the host stand ends up being our server/waitress, but that wasn't until much later.   \n\nThis is what I witnessed while i waited for service.  There was an employee moving tables around and vacuuming the floors around the table my date and I were sitting in.  This may be a little extreme, but why not really disgust guest by picking noses and farting next to dining guests?  The others were focused on the side work as well in preparation to close and leave.  Yet during cleaning up the restaurant floor, they small spec of crumbs were vacuumed but the food on the floor a few tables down from us was left alone.  I still don't understand their priorities.   The restaurant was fairly empty the this time with me being the 4th or 5th table to dine.  \n\nI give this place one (1) star only because I cannot go any lower.  I never expected to enter a dining establishment where the employees showed such disappointment because dining guests shows up 30 minutes before closing time.  The term \""going above and beyond\"" is not what this particular Carrabba's is taught, so I can only assume.  That assumption come from speaking with the manager for that night.  I was I got her name, but failed to do so because I just wanted to leave after her condescending responses.  She actually said \""well I can't be out here all the time\"" as an excuse when I explained to her the chain of events they led me to just leave.  Yes, just leave.  Not only was the server rude, she sounded annoyed that she had to explain the menu.   \n\nGoing back to the manager, I have a strong conviction that managers are to manage.  The manager for that shift is to blame for either the lack of proper training or the lack of care the employees show to their guests.  \n\nSo we leave and go to Apple Bees across the street.  The bartender there greeted us as we walked in.  The server sat us strategically so they could continue their side work without interfering with my dinging experience whereas Carrabba's just didn't care.   \n\nAll Carrabba's cannot be this bad.  I'm hoping this does not happen often, not because I care where this business goes but because it would bother me to know this happens regularly to other unsuspecting guests.   I'm sure if I decided to stay and dine at Carrabba's and leave a low or no gratuity, I can only assume they would have cursed me under their breath for being a bad tipper and not being accountable for horrible service."
0,"We went there on Christmas day, we called ahead of time to see if we needed reservations, they said no, unless you want a booth. So we reserved a booth and told them we would be there in half an hour. We arrived and no booth available, she says I see your name here, but its first come first serve, so we waited at the bar, when we were seated we ordered appetizers which were really good, but then didnt get our dinner for over an hour later. People were coming and going and we were still waiting, I complained and was told they had a party in the back room, so they were very busy. When my steak arrived it was burnt and dry, I asked for a container, I figured my dogs would like that. Worse service ever and not the friendliest place."
3,"A fairly non-descript place located in a outdoor shopping area just outisde of Las Vegas but once you are inside, it's quite large and festive. Lots of sushi options as well as cooked options too. Service was very attentive and we had plenty of food.  When it came time for the bill, we were actually surprised at how reasonable the prices were overall.  Would certainly go back when we are in Vegas again."
4,"Very high quality ingredients with great service. The atmosphere is fun if you sit at the bar, intimate if you sit in a booth, or great for families or parties at a table. My husband and I love this place. They will custom make anything, also. \nSake bomb, anyone? :-)"
4,Super crowded but worth the wait.
4,The Best place in town hands down. I  bring everyone I know when they come to visit and they always want I love sushi when they come back.
1,"This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here."
4,I started tanning at Las Vegas Tan to prepare for my wedding.  The salon is clean & contemporary and has beds that give you great color because they are properly maintained and technologically cutting edge.  I also had a custom spray tan a couple of days before my wedding.  It gave me fantastic color that lasted for a week and did not rub off on my dress.\n\nI would recommend this salon to everyone.\n\nLori
3,"I always enjoy being able to write a positive review!  This small locally owned tanning facility is clean, modern, and  the owners are friendly. \nGoggles are provided, beds are clean, and coat hooks and chairs are in the rooms!  I have to places that don't have these small but thoughtful items! \n\nIf I had to post anything potentially negative, it would be that they do not have  a stand up bed."
3,"I eat here embarassingly often. I'm talking 5-10x a year or more ! .. I'd like to say I'm drunk everytime I eat here, but like Veronica I eat here sober as well! I haven't gotten food poisoning from Taco Bell and they haven't screwed up my order very many times either. I always do the drive through, but so far so good ! The Beefy Cheesy Burrito for .99 with the rice and sour cream they are serving right now is my kryptonite. Damn you Taco Bell and your cheap crave-worthy eats."
0,"I have been taking my boys to DVP since 2002 and have never had an issue with any Dr's there. As others have said, the staff, not so much.\nNaturally I wanted to bring my new baby daughter here to see Dr. Perez.\nI am sad to see that they now require mandatory binding arbitration in order to do business here.\nWe will not be coming back."
0,"If you like Disneyland and waiting hours to ride rides, you will love this s*!t show of an office. My son has seen Dr Burford, Ky, Greenspon, Blank over the past 4 months Plan on being there all day. They moved to an even smaller location this week which is nicer than their \""prison\"" looking old location. However the prison setting is rather appropriate since their staff looks like a bunch of degenerates on a work release program. Do yourself and child better like I did today and fire these losers."
0,"OK, So I am normally a pretty big fan of Arby's. As far as fast food goes, its near the top of my list, but I will never go to this particular Arby's again. Everytime I go, something gets screwed up, and the last time I went everything about it pissed me off. I got a large drink with so much ice that I could'nt even get a straw into it, and once I managed too, there was about 2 ozs of liquid in a 32 oz cup. I asked for Arby, Horsey, and ketchup at the window, and ended up with 1 pack of Horsey. And I think for an $8 regular combo meal, they can throw a few sauces in. Very disappointed in Pecos and Windmill Arbys right now."
2,"I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good. And only $8!\nDemand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!"
1,I find it strange that people like this place. The food is not good at all. I adore anything chilli cheese..and all of their chilli cheese stuff is pretty gross. I can make better hot dogs at home. I only keep coming back for their ice cream and lemonade float. Yum. But I really dislike the food. I've tried everything on the menu and have to keep coming back here..my favorite food is the jalapeno poppers which are delicious. I just buy a bunch of those.
4,"This place has a female mechanic. We definitely need more women in the automotive industry!\n\nI requested for them to check my clutch too, even though they are not a full service autoshop. Fortunately, my clutch is working fine. I was having problems during the summer and winter, when it's hot the clutch slips too much, and when its cold during the winter it gets VERY grippy. \n\nAnyways, they proved to me that my car is fine. Just some design flaw I guess, since my car has a hydraulic self-adjusting clutch pedal. \n\nDid you know it only took like five minutes of conversing with Adriana (the female mechanic) before they returned my car with the oil, filter, and airbox filter all completely changed?!? \n\nIt may be more expensive than the usual stay at the Toyota Dealership, but appointments at the dealership took me in excess of 2 hours, possibly THREE just to get a oil change. Even though Toyota provides me a 21-point inspection, it basically is the same exact thing with JiffyLube."
0,"I have been to this jiffy lube before and the service here has always been great. However, after my most recent trip here, let's just say things weren't so great.  I parked my car behind the building where the line says 'SMOG LINE' and a manager approached me. He mentioned that the wait time was about an hour and a half. He asked me if I wanted to wait and I said yes. Then he started sweating and looked around nervously and suggested to me another business around the corner with much faster service even after I agreed to wait. I've never been basically told to kick rocks by a manager especially as a paying customer. I'm not too sure what drugs or drinks had been consumed but this was just crazy. I've never felt so embarrassed and stupid leaving a business before. Basically defeating my purpose of getting in the car in the first place. \n\n\nThis WAS my neighborhood car repair service center, but after this experience I will definitely look to yelp in finding a new care center for my vehicle!!"
0,"I'd rather take my chances at UMC Quickcare than to ever come here again. I was basically on my death bed, and they hurried me in and out and I had no idea what I even had. Lol. He gave me a zpak and sent me on my way. Dr. Schlaack was his name and I'm surprised this guy even got a degree. He barely talks. It's funny, while I was in there. He just asked what my symptoms were and only gave me a freaking zpak. Didn't say what I could or could not take with it so I ended up asking the pharmacists at WALGREENS. This place is ridiculous and the staff in general are all whack as fuck... Seriously, if you need urgent care, you're better off magically healing yourself than coming to this dump. Oh and not to mention, I get billed an extra $51.61 for I don't even know why. Although, they do charge an extra $40.00 for a \""Saturday, Sunday, Holiday fee\"" which is NOT placed anywhere in the office nor do they fail to mention that to you. STAY AWAY! THIS PLACE IS GARBAGE!"
2,This place is small... Service is slow. And there's a particular waitress that really doesn't give a damn and you just know she hates her job. \n\nSushi presentation and flavor differ every time we come here. But the fish tastes fresh. Our favorite is the touch down roll and tiger roll.\n\nWe would be here more often if we were more welcomed.
4,"Sushi Bay has been my favorite nearby Sushi joint for over 5 years now.  The staff is courteous and friendly, I have no complains about the service (and I have been here A LOT)..it has always been consistently on par. When they do get slammed it gets a little backed up, but that is understandable for such a tiny hole in the wall place. The sushi chefs are great and a lot of fun to chat with as well.\n\nOn to the sushi....Paradise roll..it's like a redneck of sushi rolls but it is damn delicious. .. shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado with their spicy yum sauce and coconut flakes. My personal favorite is Romeo...it's a less hectic and more spicy take on the Paradise roll. There are so many different choice and variations of sushi on the menu. The fish is relatively fresh and the prices are reasonable, although by no means cheap. Paradise roll is $11.50 I believe, making it the most expensive roll on the menu. The chefs are also accommodating...if you ask them to recreate a roll you like from elsewhere, they will do it.  Being that I am such a fan of Sushi Bay and highly recommend it..I am not sure what took me so long to write a review!"
3,"Not bad, not bad, check it out.\n\nOK!  If you are going for all you can eat sushi, then this probably means  you like the complicated so many flavor and stuff type of sushi. In this case, this place is just fine and you cannot go wrong.\n\n1.  For a lunch place, it is perfect. Just the right size, not too crowded and roomy.\n\n2.  Parking - Easy Strip Mall Parking.\n\n3.  Car Wash - No, just kidding, but hey, you can drop your car off at the Chevron across the street , have it washed and enjoy a good sushi meal.\n\n3.  Pricing - Just right at 21.99 all you can eat.\n\n4.  Quality - No bad!  Now I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and prefer the basic Nigiri Sushi style with the seafood on top of rice.  However, I can and will enjoy the American invented sushi rolls and here they are tasty and inventive.  the Screaming Orgasm is very tasty and different!  I enjoyed everything that we ordered!\n\n5.  Service - Just right amount of service. Just right amount of help!\n\nSide note, being of asian persuasion, I am quite sensitive to the cleanliness of the bathroom. The ole adage is that if the bathroom in the Chinese restaurant is clean, the food is bad.  Well, here,the bathroom is quite good and the food is good. So, it is a Win-Win!!!\n\nCheck it out."
1,"Food was good, thinly sliced, but good. Unfortunately, my one and only experience here was horrible. We (6 of us) were one of only two tables being served and ordered AYCE. The sushi chef did the normal greeting at most sushi restaurants, but didn't smile once the entire time. Our server did an okay job. Although, she reminded us that they charge or left overs. Are you kidding me? This ain't my first rodeo with AYCE sushi. Anyway, when we ended up being the only table left, the sushi chefs were talking smack about us in Japanese. I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected. Going back to Yama off Flamingo/Maryland and for good reason - It's worth the drive, price, service, and overall experience. If they food wasn't that good here, but the service was decent, I'd even give a better rating."
4,"This is one of my two favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. I have lived here since 2006 and I have been going here from the very beginning. They have all you can eat like every other place (they say they will charge you if you don't finish, but I have never had this happen).\n\nThis is not a place to go if you are not into a laid back environment as it is more of a family/friends place. The servers are great and leave you to your meal but the space is so small it is extremely easy to flag them down when you need something. \n\nMy only complaint and I always tell the manager is that they used to make their cucumber salad with shredded cucumbers but they have since changed to chopping them. It just doesn't taste the same, everything else however I love. I will continue to go here until I move from NV or they close their doors."
4,"I have been a long time goer to this establishment from when I was a child with family pets to now living on my own with my own pets. I currently have an Irish Wolf Hound mix (Dakota) and a Snow Shoe Siamese cat (Rogue). The dog is 10 years old while the cat is 2 years old.\n\nThe receptionists are very friendly and will greet you upon entering and they even have a greeter dog named Cheeto. Dr. Costa has been my primary Vet since obtaining both my animals. She has dealt with Rogue since she was a six week old kitten and Rogue is a very picky cat. She doesn't like most human beings outside of me and does not like being held outside of me either. Dr. Costa has such a genuine touch that she has been able to pick up Rogue and calm her down in order to trim her nails down. I've very happy to have the ability to have a Vet like that.\n\nRecently, our dog Dakota had a tumor coming out of her eye. Not only was Dr. Costa successful in getting rid of the tumor, but she also during time of operation cut off a skin growth, cleaned Dakotas teeth, and removed a bad tooth. She took amazingly good care of my elderly dog and also kept it at an amazing price.\n\nThis staff is this whole hospital is amazing---receptionists, vet techs, and vets alike.\n\nBTW, they also have a Pet-Portal Website which is able track and log your pets information. Legacy is connected to this and will send you emails when its time for shots and vaccinations."
1,"Came here to get new tires, because my tread was getting pretty low on the front two. Ended up selling me all four, and I can't honestly tell you if it was absolutely necessary or not.. But its ok, because now they are all new. About a week later I left town and parked my car at the airport to come back to my rear tire completely flat. Upset because I had just gotten new ones, but they said it was under warranty so I took it back in.  First staff member wasn't the friendliest, and  I waited an hour and a half for them to patch a hole or find what was wrong.  They came out to say they couldn't find anything wrong with it( after putting it in water to see bubbles and everything. etc..) I was pretty upset, but figured, well If it gets flat again I will just bring it back. Literally, 4 days later the exact same tire.. flat. Thankfully I have an air pressure pump at my condo because there is no way I could of even drove to a gas station. I filled it, and as I was putting the cap on the gauge, I see a very thick, and metal something sticking out in the tread. Exactly what had caused the initial flat.  VERY upset, that they ' couldn't find it' I took it back, circled it in the brightest red lipstick I own and barged in. Store manager was there that day and was very nice and apologetic, and they patched the tire successfully. However, I don't think I will go back next time as it makes me a bit weary to know that tire tecs can't find a piece of metal sticking out of the tire. Also felt a bit like they tried to take me the first round since I was a female and was upfront about knowing nothing about car specs."
0,Went back there because I had a flat tire and was towed in. They wouldn't honor warranty on tires. Said had too many miles. I had spent $2100 on rims and tires there. They tried to pressure me into buying sumitomo tires which are garbage. I drove across the street to discount tires to avoid their bullshit. They are horrible. This happened 1 1/2 years ago.
0,"My family and I had by far the worst tire experience here! We were there for over 5 hours! When we first arrived they told us an hour and a half, then continued to say a few more minutes every time we would ask to see what was taking so long. Long story short, they ended up putting parts on our truck they didn't even talk to us about. The bill came to $1200 and something but we were told $762 when they started the truck. Avoid this place, they scammed a poor little old man before us as well, came in for an oil change and ended up spending 5 hours and over $700 dollars to leave again...poor Charlie. This place is filthy as well, dead bugs, broken lights, dirt EVERYWHERE......Go to Costco or Sams, trust me!"
0,"Do NOT go here. The doctors are good enough but the wait time to get in the room is at least 30 minutes each time. Check in: 10:35, appt time: 10:45, time now 11:27. KMN! \n\nUpdate: they called and said I couldn't be seen there because I had missed 1 appointment in 2009 and 2010 and and 2013. How rude is that? No customer relations at all."
0,By far the worst car wash I've used. My car ended up worse coming out. I had to go to the gas station next door to wipe down my windshield since there was soap streaks all over it. It looked like my car was rained on and left to dry. Save yourself the time.
0,"I wish I had something positive to say about my hair but I didn't even get a chance to try this place out! I asked the lady at the front if anyone was available for a consultation and after giving me a lackluster \""I'll check\""...she didn't get back to me for 15 minutes! I walked back up to the counter to ask again and it seemed like she had forgotten. Disappeared to the back and came back after another 10 min, didn't acknowledge me at all so I ask again and still not a yes OR no! I wait even longer while she is checking AGAIN. Nothing. I'm standing in front of you!!! I obviously left....if they can't even figure out how to sit me in a chair in front of a stylist then how can I dare trust whatever stylists they may have???? Pretty disappointed to say the least. It would have been an expensive job, too."
0,"I purchased a Groupon for an oil change but after upgrading to Synthetic oil I ended paying $94 in top of the $15.00 for the original oil change. Honesty? I didn't get it at this location. No Savings at all, you will be scam is no way out. You will see it. Also they give a price $239 for rear brakes pad but they did not get me here, I got it done for $89.00."
0,"HORRIBLE! I WAS a customer of this place for several years, until new management took over within the last couple years. Took my truck in for a coolant system issue, and was told I needed a BRAND NEW RADIATOR. After everything, and a \""$100 great customer\"" discount, I was quoted $1,200. I went to the Big O across the street from this terrible Midas, and was quoted $500, and my radiator was JUST FINE. I will never go back to this Midas, as now they're just a bunch of con-men. No wonder their business is so slow now."
2,"It's alright. I had The breakfast egg bacon and potato burrito. HUBBZ had the carne asada wet burrito, he said it was good because he was super hungry.. in man language it means he's had better.\n\nI had the green salsa on the side of my burrito, not spicy enough for me."
0,"Joshua's review was spot on. The first thing recommended to me by the good doctor was an expensive and rather extreme test with no interest in discussing symptoms or any past medical history. He had one foot out the door the whole time. Any input from me was cut off or otherwise dismissed. The whole consultation was terse, bewildering, and illustrated that he sees you not as a patient, but as a walking moneybag. Never again."
0,"Had an extremely unpleasant experience, will not be returning. There are plenty of reviews online on other websites about this doctor expressing the same general feelings. \n\n5 reasons why I wouldn't go back...\n\n1. They spelled my name wrong within the system. After I told the assistant, she notified the receptionist, but sure enough it was still wrong on the paperwork they gave me after the appointment.\n\n2. Came at 11:40am and left at 1pm (Friday) only 4 people were in the waiting area. I could hear the doctor talking to a vendor outside the waiting room they put me in.\n\n3. Saw doctor at 12:50pm and left the building by 1pm. He spent 10 minutes to tell me my lab results were perfect and that I had nothing to worry about.\n\n5. He kept the door open the entire time I was with him, seemed impatient and in a rush. Wanted me in and out, I had to ask him questions as he stood by the door to prevent him from cutting our session short.\n\nI was extremely unsatisfied, doctor did not show any sympathy or interest towards my concerns and was impatient. \n\nIronically my dad had an appointment right after me and his experience was a little different. The doctor was extremely boastful and just bragged about some of his accomplishments to my dad. \n\nI believe he tries to hook in patients that will have a bigger payout for him and spends less time and interest in younger folks. \n\nBe warned, he cares more about your wallet than your health."
2,Very low key kool area. A salon right across and beanch to sit on in front of the wondow. Overall it is like being in San Diego Ca.
2,This time I went online to the web sight and scheduled an appointment. I made it for 8:30am and i got called back at 8:35am. Not to bad!!\nThey were very busy. If u did not have an appointment they had an hour wait!!\nMake an appointment for any blood work
4,My oldest daughter got her braces off six years ago. My eldest son just got his braces off last year. my youngest son has just finished his phase one and my youngest daughter will start her phase one next year. \nWe have loved every minute of this process and I think my children's teeth are absolutely beautiful!  The office staff is so very kind and treat us like family. I feel blessed that I was referred to dr. Noorda when we moved to Vegas. Dr. Noorda is kind patient and intelligent. I highly recommend them.
0,"This place has improved some but is still pretty bad. The staff was horrible prior to the move from Green Valley to the new location on Horizon Ridge. They have hired a nice receptionist, young brunette, to take over for the bad attitude Asian one, they put her in the back. \n\nI always saw a nurse. It took 2 yrs of going here before I finally saw  Dr. Nancy Long.  The Dr. seemed nice but wasn't helpful stating I needed surgery after seeing me once. I refuse to see the nurse Robin anymore. Robin is mean & unprofessional. Robin opened the exam room door while I was in stir ups to have a conversation & made rude comments to me about my medical history. The other nurse Cindy is caring & helpful.  The same experience pregnant or not. \n\nOh yeah & expect to wait for hours."
0,"I have spent a lot of money at this place and will still do, but I do not enjoy the experience there.\n\n1.  Selection - They do have a great selection of furniture, TV, carpet and electronics. Not so much on appliances.\n\n2.  Sales/Service - The sales team are very aggressive and I have encountered some really goods ones and a lot of arrogant or pushy ones too. I just ignore the pushy ones and come back to buy from another later. Why come back, convenience and selection.\n\n3.  Prices - Not bad, not great. \n\n4.  Store - Very nice set up and lots of great stuff. I have bought my fair share of goods here from the \""display\"", so they are quite effective for sure.\n\n5.  Bad Experience - My personal experience at the store is hit or miss. more misses. I used to come here with my family to browse and see what was available on a Saturday. One Saturday, they were giving out balloons to all the kids. I asked for one for each of my three kids and basically waited 10 minutes and no one could help me, or told me we had to get it at the end of our visit and not the beginning. So, I tried it and after 45 minutes we left and asked for balloons and they said no. I asked why all the other kids had them when they ENTERED the store but we had to wait... No positive answer.\n\n6.  Bad Experience - Went there with the family when they were giving out hot dogs and drinks as a way to drive traffic.  Nothing was available and I was a bit annoyed.  I should have known better.\n\n7.  Bad Experience - I complained to the store in writing about my experiences. NO RESPONSES on two occasions. Just a complaint on how to improve.\n\n8.  Bad Experience - Went to buy a Fridge, huge 65\"" flat screen, Microwaves and a 32\"" flat screen for the office. Was dressed in work boots and kinda dirty. Most of the sales staff ignored me and turned the other way. I had to seek out a sales person, a newbie and bout over 10k from him in 15 minutes.  Why do I feel like I have to do all the work.\n\nBut alas, I am a numbnut because I still go there. Why?  Again, selection and convenience. I go there to get what I need, but I am no longer a loyal customer."
4,"I have nothing bad to say about my RC Willey experience.\n\nMy fiance picked out a new couch in the Henderson store.  We were pleasantly surprised - the salespeople were somehow able to strike the balance between being helpful and letting us browse without pressure.  We chose a beautiful tan leather sofa (which, of course, was backordered).  When it was delivered, I was surprised that the delivery was actually made IN THE TIME FRAME GIVEN!  You know how it goes... they say sometime between 11 and 2, and it ends up being 9 p.m.... well, not this time!  The delivery men worked very hard to get the large couch in our small apartment without destroying anything.  I was surprised that we didn't lose a wall, but they were skilled!\n\nOur couch is in perfect condition.  We even got a follow-up call from the store manager to make sure it was delivered satisfactorily.  All in all, we couldn't be more pleased with RC Willey.  We will be returning when we want more furniture!"
0,"Poor customer service! I saw plenty of associates yet none of them even said hello. In fact I was the one who said hello FIRST to the \""greeter\"" lady at the entrance.  She sat there perched like a parrot the whole time. Why are you sitting there staring at ppl instead of saying, \""Hello and welcome to RC Willey are you familiar with our store?? I can help you or an associate can...\""something like that. Anyway, I decided to mention the bad customer service on the way out, (should've gotten a manager, and told him/her I know) and she gave a \""well some of the employees go home at 5:30pm.\"" I thought yeah and???  The good part was that she apologized for any inconvenience.  Thanks. As far as furniture, you can buy comparable, quality pieces for LESS from other nice stores in Las Vegas. Save your cash amigos...NEXT!"
1,"I really needed carpet and I was impressed with a carpet promotional card that came in the mail for RC Willey. $39 installation and 15-20% off all Stainmaster carpets. I thought I hit a lucky strike. \n\nI called to schedule a measurement of my home. The guy was nice enough and ensured me this twice a year offer was one RC Willey actually looses money on. He explained they try to boost sales even if there is virtually no mark-up. Okay, I thought. Seems somewhat logical...I guess.\n\nSo I go in to RC Willey and meet a sales rep. She has me look at tons of samples and has me pick like 10. After 30 mins of this, I ask if these are the promotional Stainmaster carpets. She assures me everything is on sale. Im suspicious but I play along.\n\nFinally I have her quote me for one sample I liked. Mind you its 3 bedrooms and less than 600 total sq feet. The price: $3300. Like as in $1100 per average size 10x10 bedroom I ask, and she says \""yes' with a straight face. So I ask what is really on a good sale like as described in the flyer? She explains the samples with a black dot is what is on special (like why didn't she say this at first?). So out of 1000's of samples like 12 have the black dot (if you can find them).\n\nOf course the samples on sale are the ugliest. Drab grays and browns and cheap materials. One was dark burgundy with rose pattens, I kid you not. \n\nI am annoyed and ask for a quote for the least of the ugly cheap sample I can find. Price: $1700. Plus I will have to move all my own furniture. I call around to multiple carpet dealers in town (there are tons) and get quotes for hundreds of dollars less, some almost half of these prices.\n\nLong story short, RC Willey uses gimmicks and the old bait and switch to get people in the store. A total waste of everyone's time. \n\nNever again"
3,"Huge store, carries just about anything you can think of. Indoor and outdoor furniture, appliances, flooring, a bit of decor and a good size clearance area. It definitely falls on the 'classic and comfy' style of things. Not modern in the least, there a little bit of crossover contemporary but not a lot. They do have a large number of sectionals in varying styles.  My only complaint is although the service is very friendly I felt like I was claimed by one salesperson and then followed for the entire time I was in there. Completely put me off, I was clear I wasn't buying just looking, but still felt a bit pressured."
0,Ok so I have purchased items from RC Wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again. I had a $500 credit limit after I purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (Apparently since I paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) When we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  So I spent my $2300 at Ashley furniture. RC Wiley apparently is balling and they don't need me to buy anything. Good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad.
0,"Several years back I had a horrible encounter and told myself I would never be back. Well, fast forward and few years and unfortunately the couch we fell in love with was lacated at RC Willey, so here we go again. We finally got it down to a good price and the salesperson asked if we wanted the extended warranty. I asked her what it covered and she responded everything. So, I asked her you mean to tell me if my dog chews a hole in the couch you will fix it for free??? She said absolutely!!! It's covered!!! Well, my dog indeed chewed a small hole in the corner of the sectional and guess what they said when I called.....you guessed it! It's not covered. I should of known better. The have let me down everytime I have purchased from them."
1,"I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches."
2,I love the cherry dipped cones!\n\nStill sad they got rid of the cotton candy blizzard- was my absolute favorite!
1,"Back in the days of 2006-2007, I used to be a regular at Pumi for the creative sushi chefs and friendly service. Then, as has been well-documented in reviews before mine, the place changed owners/managers/etc and everything went downhill. The fish was not as fresh and prices were higher. After a couple subpar experiences, we cut Pumi from our lives. \n\nWell a few years have passed since we were in this place, so we decided last night to give it another chance. Since I'm with child, I can't eat sushi for a few months (booo). Instead, we sat in back for hibachi where they couldn't even turn the lights on for us! Seriously, we sat and ate in near darkness back there. The hibachi chef was friendly enough, and his rice/veggies/chicken were decent. Shrimp was rubbery, though, and my husband's NY was so thin, they definitely cut them in half. Hey, I have no problem with a place like that as long as it is reflected in the price, but if anything, Pumi has adjusted their prices up. Another negative - that creamy sauce that all hibachi/teppanyaki restaurants give you was really gross at Pumi. I usually eat the whole thing, but theirs tasted like watery mayonnaise.\n\nService was fine.\n\nOverall, Pumi, it's gonna be at least another 2 years before I try you again."
4,I had an emergency and these good folks were wonderful. They stayed after-hours to treat me. The staff couldn't have been more wonderful and Dr. Scott Manthai gave me great care and follow-up. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0,"Wow, dude was stoned or something.  I was looking for a bike and asked \""how would X compare to X?\""  Answer: \""It's black, it's legit, too legit to quit.\""  I'm not joking.  So maybe this is the greatest shop in the city but I didn't stick around to find out.  It was a very uncomfortable experience."
3,"I love that Bike Shop is a locally-owned place that really cares about the local biking community. They have a full calendar of group rides, and they host special events like ladies night where they have vendors in with specials and they go over simple maintenance, etc. \nI have gotten excellent advice from them, even when it didn't result in a sale.\nThe service is reasonably priced and the staff is very knowledgeable, but they do have a tendency to get backed up. I recently had to wait an entire week just to get a wheel trued, a process that probably took them about 20 minutes.\nThe shop has a decent selection of apparel and accessories, but they are extremely overpriced. I might go there to look at something, but then I would turn around and buy it on amazon or bikenashbar. Same is true with their bikes - all very expensive."
1,"This review is for the Take Care Clinic more than the store itself.\n\na.  The waiting line - 2 star  - I really like the computerized check in system they have here. You can go on line or check in on their computer. It is totally cool, except that it takes a long time to check in. I am not sure if it saved my data from last time, I had to enter everything again. This thing is nice but very inefficient. \n\nb.  The Nurse Practitioner. 5 star - I thought this person was really good and explained everything. Helpful, caring and efficient.\n\nc.  Services offered - Saves you from having to pay high fees and long wait times at the other urgent care places. I think this is great.\n\nd.  Privacy - Limited. As they start talking to you in the main reception area, everyone waiting in this small modest area can hear you.  They end up taking you inside the room for more details, but the privacy is a bit sketchy in my book.\n\ne.  Charges - We are under 60 but got the shingle vaccine.  Cost is over 200.00 per person. This is standard as insurances will cover you after 60, but before it is on you.  I accept this but the system they have and how you check in does not let you know this in detail.  And, what is worse, the clinics billing is poor. I paid all my fees on Amex and still getting a bill to pay the fees from their central billing department. This bill is poorly done, not too much information and on the back there is no data on what to do if you dispute or anything like terms or conditions. \n\nI will come back again, as it is cheaper than urgent care, but this place is not too inviting as the experience is kind of blah."
1,I'm only giving them 2 stars because from the outside the shop looks nice. \n\nBut what I don't like about this place is their false advertising. On their door and on their voicemail they said they'd be open on NYE until 1pm. I am here 25 minutes before then and they aren't. \n\nI drove out of my way specifically to come here and they aren't there. These types of careless mistakes can cost you customers and better yet negative review reporting.\n\nThis type of thing shouldn't happen. Although it might be a little mistake it was careless and it just costed them an angry customer.
0,"Ordered from here tonight. I was so excited to have deep dish! I lived in Chicago for 37 years and terribly miss deep dish. So glad Rosati's is out here in Las Vegas. Until tonight. My pizza I had delivered was raw. The supervisor Alison was very rude. Kept saying they're all timed so it can't be raw. She wouldn't let me get a word in. Amateur supervisor no doubt. Her manager wouldn't let her refund it without the pizza. Are you kidding me?! What are they going to do with it? After I paid for delivery, they wanted me to drive it back. Sorry, have your driver come get it. After too much discussion they finally did. I showed the driver and she said \""that's what it's supposed to look like\"". Sorry, I have had many deep dish and none were raw. This is clearly NOT what it's supposed to look like. They wouldn't refund delivery either. Terrible pizza and even worse customer service! I had to give one star or this wouldn't post, but I'd really give them no stars."
3,"Quiet, good friendly service, huge food portions. 2 people can share 1 meal."
3,"If you're not looking for this place, you just might miss it. It's tucked away in a strip mall and worth the hunt. I went with Elite Emily as we explored Henderson more, and we were practically the only people in the spot. The orders were HUGE. It takes a lot for me to wave the white flag, but I had to ask for a box. All the food is fresh and pretty dern tasty. There's really nothing you can go wrong with here, so I'm looking forward to my next trip to try something else!"
2,"These undercooked biscuits were atrocious! Incredibly salty alone and chewing on them was like biting into the Pilsbury doughboy! I'm sure this isn't a common occurrence however, this review is based off of my experience at this location for this visit only. Our server was freakin amazing and he was so nice to every table. I hope IHOP appreciates him and I wish I can say his name in this revue, but it violates yelps terms. Long story short, the restaurant smells like sewer gas occasionally, my blueberry cheesecake waffles were perfect and delicious."
3,"It was Thanksgiving morning and we wanted to meet friends for brunch. Not a lot of choices in places to eat. It seems that only Denny's or IHOP would be available on Thanksgiving . We chose IHOP. To my delightful surprise we got seated right away in a perfect table in the back in the corner where it was quiet and we could talk. I chose a \""fitness\"" item. This was a omelette with egg whites, veggies, and cheese, topped with lots of diced tomatoes. I had a choice of sides. Being at the House of Pancakes, I chose a small stack of three pancakes as my side. I was absolutely delighted with my choices. The omelette was delicious and incredibly filling. In fact I was only able to eat half. The stack of pancakes did not disappoint. They had a choice of syrups. I originally tried the old fashioned syrup. But then I switched to the butter pecan syrup. That was excellent. I really enjoyed my brunch. We were not rushed and were able to sit and chat with all friends for as long as we liked. The price was ridiculously reasonable, especially since we had a coupon. A very nice choice for a Thanksgiving morning."
3,"I booked a block of rooms at The Artisan for my birthday.  I heard it was a cool, swanky place with an awesome vibe to it.  \n\nThe decor and atmosphere is amazing.  You could visit this hotel many times and discover something new each time. \n\nI checked in as soon as I could, which was around 3PM.  I needed a room with two beds, and they wouldn't let me reserve a room with two beds; they said it was first come, first serve!\n\nThe room was very good for the price ($89.)  It was clean and was decorated in a very baroque style.  The room and bathroom were small and my window had a terrible view (the hotel's location is not the best.)  I stayed in the Gauguin room.\n\nThere were a few minor cosmetic details that could have been attended to, but since I was staying less than 24 hours, it just really wasn't important to me.\n\nIt is important to note that this is a hotel with a loud, active nightlife.  Well, it has an loud, active afternoon life, too.\n\nMost of my guests who stayed here were subjected to loud music all afternoon; so loud napping was impossible.  This was not the case on my side of the hotel, which faced the freeway.  At night, it is practically impossible to sleep the music in the nightclub and pool party are so loud.  I didn't turn in until 4am, but the music went on til about 7AM.  It was so loud for my mother, she went down stairs, complained, asked for her money back, and made the 1.5 hour drive home at midnight.\n\nStay here if you are looking for a neat experience, and you are a partier and want to participate in the nightlife.  Don't stay here if you want a good night's sleep."
0,"One of the best and worst Las Vegas Experiences iv had. Now getting a Michael Angelo Suit with a Pool Table for under $500 a night on a Labor day Weekend last minute sounds great right? Well listen to this story. \n\nWe Went to Las Vegas a day early innately staying at the MGM so we needed a room and they were all out we got recommended to this place by someone working at MGM. \n\nNow we get there at first scared to go in because it looked like a MOTEL 8 from the outside. But we gave it a shot anyways. We walked in and it looked really cool at first so were like this is better then we thought. We made friends fast with Jen the girl working up front and soon checked out there rooms. The first room they gave us with there standard room which was small but nicely decorated that had a busted door so for security reasons we asked for a room change. Instead of getting a room change we decided to shell out the extra cash and get the Michael Angelo Suit. Honestly it was tacky and looked and smelled like a place a pimp would bring his hoes for a Orgy. But whatever we decided to make the best of it.\n\nThe girl who gave us the tour to the room mentioned that this hotel is NON-SMOKING but if u get the suit u can do whatever u want u can smoke there just crack open the window. Like a dumby we trusted her and smoked in the room to only find later  they hit ME with a $250 fee. The room was split between me and my cousin but i got hit with the fee. Then when i called them to ask for my money back they said they would give only half and i said fine. And then i saw my bill they didnt take it off i called back later they said oh yeah we were supposed to take it off but there manager reversed it and that if i want to pay half they decided i should have my cousin pay half of it which i was not going to do..There a bunch of let downs. \n\nMy advice is just stay away from this place its shady get a real room at a real place like Palazzo or MGM or Wynn were u can smoke at least and not get hit $250 for a cheep wanna be motel 8 turned into a \""LOCAL CRACK SPOT\"" hotel."
2,Good service....room was unique...neighbors next door partied til 6am...security n front desk did everything they could! Lounge is always a fun time...want to try Rumors next!!!
0,"I stayed at this hotel the very first time I went to Vegas, which was in November 2006. It was scary from the moment we walked into the lobby. My friend said it best, \""It looks like the kind of place you see in horror movies. The kind where you go in and never come out.\"" I guarantee if you stay here you'll definitely want to come right back out. The elevators are spooky, and so were both of the rooms we saw. Yes, we saw two rooms because the room they originally sent us to was not ready. As in it looked as if the previous guests had left about 5 minutes prior to our arrival. It was a mess. The room we ended up staying in wasn't a whole lot better. the bathroom was disgusting (there was urine on the floor) the toilet barely worked, and the faucet handle kept coming off whenever you tried to wash your hands. Our room was right on the freeway side, so I guess it's a good view if you like looking out the window at the 15 (not to mention HEARING the 15 freeway). The staff did as little as they possibly could to resolve our issues, and the assistant manager was one of the most arrogant, condescending persons I've come across in life period, not just when it comes to hotel staff. He didnt offer so much as an apology, and was absolutely not subtle about the fact that he didn't want to be bothered with us. Our reservation was for 2 days but we checked out the morning after our 1st night there, we have no intention of going back, and want to warn any others that may consider staying at this hotel.\n\nPros: Nothing\nCons: Everything"
1,"I understand that the Artisan has changed direction and while I can see that the changes they've made have increased their business, it feels like this transformation is spiraling out of control.\n\n Gone are the cozy little areas to sit, unless you want bottle service. They've also removed all the tables around the bar and even the bar stools. The bartender explained to us that since they are known as an after-hours place, they don't want people sitting at the bar, because people can't get up to it to get a drink. I might have agreed with that decision,  were we not literally the only people in the bar.\n\n  On a Saturday night at 11pm there were more employees than customers and more confusion than good times to be had. We already had drinks in our hand and were sent outside to get a stamp; great job, team. The bartender had a terrible attitude...until it was time to tip her. Also, our drinks were served in plastic solo cups; how tacky is that? You charge $15 a drink and you can't afford something a little nicer? We went out the patio, where we were told we had to buy a hookah to sit at a table. A hookah? The patio was also nearly empty, so it just made us feel unwelcome and that there were far too many rules to follow for us to enjoy ourselves. \n\n What I love about this place; the decor. It's a beautiful place, there is no denying that. I like that it's been cleaned up, because it felt like it was circling the drain the last time I stayed in a room there. I also love that there isn't any gaming. That's the end of my list, currently.\n\n We had one drink and left. On the way to the next stop, my girlfriend said \""raise your hand if this cab ride is more fun than the Artisan\""; every hand went up."
0,"Not a place to stay if you wish to sleep. Made reservations months ago for the largest suite in the place and was told after checking in, as a side note, \""We have an after hours club but because you are on the fifth floor you should be fine and not hear it.\"" Wrong!\nFinally had to abandon the room at 3AM and the front desk was not willing to do anything. Didn't even have the earplugs their website boasted. (Should have made the connection then.)\nUpon checkout, the manager worked as hard as he could to be unhelpful and explained that it was not his fault we were unable to use the room for sleep and complaints rarely come from the fifth floor. Really? Do they think I'm lying? \nSo unhelpful and the worst customer service I have ever experienced in Las Vegas. \nHated this place and never going back. I suggest nobody come if you anticipate using your room for sleep."
1,"I hear this place is hopping at around 2am.  I were here around midnight, on a Saturday night and it was dead!  The floors were sticky and the service was lacking.  I may try it again sometime but I'm not racing to go back immediatley."
2,"I have had a Chinese food craving so I have been going for the lunch specials about twice a week.  I decided that I am going to go up and down Spring Mountain to check out all of the Chinese food places.\n\nMy first stop was Cafe Noodle, I didn't hear anything about this place until I walked through the door.  I went in originally to get some good noodles, but their noodle dishes seemed standard for a Chinese restaurant so I decided to do the lunch special.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao squid, above everything else it was FRESH.  It tasted like they prepared it while I was waiting.  The special comes with some rice, a spring roll and a won ton.  The rice, spring roll and won ton were more then less forgettable.  For 6 bucks though the deal was good and the food filling.  If you eat there I believe you get soup and tea.\n\nI have been there twice since the first time and judging on the quality of food I will be back again."
3,Great place! \n\nFood was excellent. Some of the best HK style food I've had. Service was great and the food came out fast. \n\nI highly recommend it if you need a break from all the buffets!\n\nI'm definitely coming back on my next trip to vegas!
2,"Their wait staff is terrible but what do you expect at a chinese restaurant,. \n\nSad to say but the proof is out there..\n\nThe place is not so clean.  Their seats are eh.\n\nFood comes Out quick and that doesn't mean it's pre cooked, Chinese food is just cooked fast.\n\nTheir prices are really good! \n\nThey have a late night five dollar specially I've yet to try but my normal orders are usually:\n\nJelly fish, roast duck, whole deep fried chicken,dumplings, BBQ pork fried rice, and of course their hong kong style pan fried noodles.\n\nI really love their HK noodles. They're my favorite in town over Joyful House.\n\nAfter their stint on dirty dining it's hard to return often.\n\nTheir hot tea is mediocre but again, their staff sucks."
2,"Food: \nfood was good, not great. \n\nPrice: \nmore expensive than other restaurants I've been to. \n\nService: \nThe guy who took my order (take out) seemed too serious and uptight, but the woman who gave me my order was friendly. \n\nOverall, would not come back."
1,"I must say, this is definitely not on my \""favorite, oh my gosh I love this place\"" Chinese joints. I love the price of the stuff here, and I always end up finding myself here to feed a big group of people, or to fix a really really late night craving for Chinese food. \n\nService is generally really fast, but the food is normally on the salty side, like \""oh my gosh I can totally taste the MSG\"" and I normally get a headache after eating here and I think it's from the seasoning, or just the MSG they add to the meals. The place isn't super clean, but it's not disgusting dirty. I do like the taste of their hot tea here that they serve. \n \nFood is nicely portioned, so like I said, I definitely like the price of everything here especially because they have the \""special price/portioned\"" menu. It's easy to feed a party of 10+ more people and end up only paying $10-$15 each if you split the bill'' and you'll have order a shit load of food, like over 6 or 7 dishes. This is a good place to come and eat if you're hungry and you wanna split the bill so you can try everything that's ordered.\n\nThey normally do a good job at accommodating very large groups. Bathroom isn't all that clean, so I would suggest hold it if you can. \n\nOh and parking is a total bitch in the plaza where this restaurant is located so know you have been warned. When the parking lot is full (which it normally is always full) you have to park in the Chinatown parking lot next to this plaza."
0,"I really wanted to give this place stars but when you live in the Bay Area and have access to so many pho spots this place just does not meet the mark.  Especially when they want to charge 8.50 a medium bowl..... The decor has been updated since last yet the service and food is the same.. just pricier.  I have heard that their crab/crayfish night is the fun/tasty however I have yet to experience it.  This review is based on 8 different returns to the restaurant... different times of year, different years.  Yeahhhhhh-- not again."
2,"24 hour pho is unheard of where I am from so this place is amazing just for that!\n\nThe amount of meat in the pho is good, there are plenty of the veggie/herbs. I wish there was just a little more noodle, probably because the broth is so salty I'm 98 percent sure there's MSG in it.\nI don't really have a problem with that, I just need more soda than the one can to get through it.\n\nThis place seems a little hyped just because it's 24 hours but there are better pho spots in town by far."
2,"Haven't always been a big fan of pho but this place gets the job done after a weekend of heavy intoxication. Soup, in general, cures a lot for me! The regular bowl was a good size. It had just enough noodles and soup. Though it would've been better if they added more brisket and steak. Gotta love that extra meat! Waiters seemed funny here probably because I couldn't fully understand their jokes but I guess it made up for the o-k service. The extra star really belonged to the desserts I tried on my recent visit. There were these ice cream balls called exotic bomba and bomba. (Filipinos, don't get any dirty ideas!) Both were actually pretty good. The exotic bomba had a fruitier taste coated with white chocolate and the bomba had a coffee taste coated with milk chocolate. Once again, I was suckered into the sweets!"
3,"Love this place. Just took down the shrimp rolls and some pho, always good no matter what time."
0,"First, Saigon 8 is much better. The bathroom smells like a petting zoo at Kim Long, and there were roaches on the floor. The parking is crowded and it smells like an armpit. Trust me, I've been to many pho places in garden grove and Westminster and this place is schwag. \n\nAlso, you'll like what happened there: \n\nThere is a nice looking girl at the front (employee) that drives an expensive benz, and my buddy quietly said \""oh, that's a nice looking girl\"". Nobody at my table cared and our conversation moved on to gambling talk. Then, the bus boy strolled up to our table and instead of asking if everything was alright, rudely said \""how do you know my fiance, and why are you talking about her\"". I almost started laughing because a thought it was a joke, but the guy was mad. \n\nI walked up to the manager and expressed my concern, then I asked the girl why her fiance was bugging us. She said she is not engaged, and definitely not to the bus boy, lol. Then mysteriously the bus boy became silent and disappeared. The kitchen cleared out like there was going to be a fight, in fact the waiter called them up front like an old kung fu movie. It was disrespectful to all the customers, my table, the girl, and embarrassing to mgmt and the bus boy. \n\nWhat a weird place, I also think he might have thought we were talking about the girl because my fiend's name is genny and maybe that was her name, but what a bunch of foolishness. \n\nEither way, if you are not trying out for a kung fu movie where you have to fight the whole staff, I suggest going elsewhere. This is not the best pho, and they are not the best listeners. They are quick to judge. It smells and has bugs. \n\nI will be sure to only stop here if I have to take a dump."
2,"Friends from So Cal were visiting and wanted to come here.  One of them is a FOB Vietnamese (she calls herself that!) and has dined here before.  Her boyfriend also loves the place and so do I, so we had lunch yesterday.\n\nI had the Beef Fried Rice, she had I the Sweet & Sour Pork Chops, and I don't know what her boyfriend had, but it looked good.  All of the dishes were excellent.  We didn't leave hungry, that's for sure!\n\nThe only strike against this place is that the servers here seem so unfriendly.  They don't say hello, have a mean look on their face all the time, and when my friend asked for chopsticks, the server gave her a mean look and pointed to the chopsticks on the table....she obviously didn't see it, but it was the way he handled it that was shocking.  The funny part is that she's Vietnamese, so you would think they would treat Gringo's like that, but not their own....whatever.  They only get 3 Stars because of the service.\n\nWill I return?  Pho-gettah 'bout it, of course!"
3,I prefer the pho at Pho Kim Long over any other pho restaurant in Las Vegas. Very inexpensive and delish! I don't feel overly full and stuffed. I feel healthy leaving. I've never ordered anything but pho #10. Soooo good!!
2,"It is and will always be that late night restaurant that is super fast, semi lively, and satisfying. This place has totally surpassed its name by remotely being called \""F**cking Long\"" by many. It utterly appears to me as having one of the quickest service.. almost as fast as McDonalds.\n\nSince I first came to this place, the quality of the restaurant itself had changed dramatically.. only for the good though! Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed. There used to be an open area seafood, like the tanks you would see at 99 Ranch or any other Asian market, which was cool and all, but they got rid of it and added an extra table. The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!\n\nOf course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well. \n\nGirls, if you're looking for some Viet men or some late night attention, they would gladly tend to your needs and ignore majority of the customers. Don't forget, if there are other groups of girls who come in who, lets say, came back from clubbing, you would immediately become one of the rejectees and may have some difficulty getting employee attention. Real shit, they kind of flirt way too much. I know it's common elsewhere but sometimes.. I just want to eat my food and be treated equally! :\\"
2,"Searched for 24HR pho restaurants that were open and this was amongst the list. You probably already know why my friends and I chose this place.\n\nAnyway, it took forever to get our food. Not the usual in less than 5MIN. so it was kinda strange having to wait for pho.\n\nI got the rare steak pho and it was just... okay. The broth wasn't that great but I was craving pho so it \""I guess\"" it satisfied my cravings.\n\n3 stars because this place is open 24HRS!"
3,"Open 24/7!\n\nHonestly, I don't remember what I had but it was good! \n\nAll I know is, if I were hungover, I will hands down convince all my other hungover friends to go here and have some good, homemade Vietnamese food!"
1,"Rip off. \nThey think they are a 5 star restaraunt. 15% tips was automatically added to the bill. Water was not refilled until I waived down the waiter, waiter did not check to see what we neeeded, we had to pay at register. \nFood B, Service C, Atmosphere B, Price C."
3,"After hearing several people Rave about Pho Kim Long, I decided to check it out; and I can say I was not disappointed.\n\nThe place is fairly big and we were seated immediatley (there can be a wait but they burn and turn pretty fast). The staff was attentive and we had several people swing by the table to make sure we were doing OK.\n\nThe menu is impressive, I was just expecting your average Pho place, but they menu covers much more, apps, Pho, entrees, smoothies, and much much more.\n\nI decided on the #11 Rare Steak and Brisket Pho. I also got an order of the Chinese Doughnuts to start.\n\nMy only complaint is that the doughnuts were plain, when I usually order them they're covered in sugar, but a little quick thinking and I was using the remaining Peanut Sauce from my companion's spring rolls for a great dish.\n\nThe Food came out insanely fast, the apps were good, but the Pho stole the show. The Steak and Brisket were both tender and delicious. The noodles were plentiful, and the broth was rich.\n\nI will be going back without a doubt!"
3,"I wonder how they come up with these names...\n\nNonetheless, the pho was great. The wait to get a table was short and the food came pretty quickly. There were a lot of things on the menu, including some Chinese cuisine. The prices are pretty low too. However, I just wanted some simple pho. I don't really know how you could get pho wrong and I hope to never experience that, but this place did the trick.\n\nAlso, it's open 24 hours."
0,pho is good when your hungover.. so i will eat it where ever but there was this one time the busboy was cleaning up dishes and he brought out this bucket of dirty dishes which smelled like complete ass! completely lost my appetite right there but it came back when the food finally came out. they didnt have any sauce trays stocked at our table and my buddy's food came out a decade after i finished my food.. pretty bad restaurant but you cant complain as it is probably the best las vegans can find
4,"This place gets brownie points in my book for being open during the wee hours of the night. This place would normally be an average 3-4 star rating but it gets 5 stars due to the fact that its open 24 hours, it's located off Spring Mountain and Valley View (relatively close to the strip, making it convenient for late night eats for locals getting off work or after a night of clubbing or gambling). \n\nWhat I also like about this place is that no matter how busy it is, service here is FAST! After sitting down and ordering, I'm pretty sure we almost always get our orders (even with parties of 4+) within 15-20min or less!\n\nI always start off with ordering their calamari which I find very tasty. Then I enjoy ordering the Mongolian beef or the Bun bo hue; a vermicelli noodle soupy have good pho according to my Vietnamese friends who always order that but I usually don't get it because I'm not in the mood for soup and the bun is basically the same ingredients without the broth."
1,"Wow, things change really quickly over in Chinatown. \n\n1st time I came here, I had such a good time that I gave this place a 5-star review. After my last 2 visits..Now, I gotta give it only 2 stars. \n\nThe staff was rude this time around. Very anti-social and easily irritated. \nThe staff was constantly making fun of customers behind their backs. Calling them all types of degrading names and making fun of their hair, clothes, etc. I found their behavior to be very out-of-line. \n\nFood was still really good. So they get 1 more star. \n\nI don't understand why this place attracts such a shady crowd?  People all around me were loudly talking about sexual topics, drugs, and screaming profanity in the air.   I really don't mind that atmosphere because I use a lot of profanity myself, but this place is designed like one of those fancy 5-star restaurants, so I would expect a more upscale crowd.  Infact, I enjoy that kind of atmosphere when I am at a  dive-place like \""Ellis Island\"" or downtown, but \""Pho Kim Long\"" is a fine-dining establishment with it's giant neon fish tanks, marble tables, and chandeliers. I know I am in my 20s, but I have a lot of friends who are 60+, and one of my friends is actually a former civil rights activist from the 1960s. I felt really  bad having a man of his integrity have to sit there and listen to drunks and typical vegas-trash talk so much sh!t around him.  \n\nThis sucks because now I gotta find another 24 hour Pho place. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know."
2,"I just come here for late night meals after work. Everyone from Vegas knows Pho Kim Long. This is why it tends to be the meet-up point for most locals. Always busy, but the food is eh. Nothing special at all. Seriously. Just an average pho place. Weird thing is that they fill their waters ahead of time in case they get busy. If I did that at my restaurant, I would get chewed out. I don't think it's against health regulations or anything, but it's just odd. Cheap, well-known, open late = keywords."
2,Pho Kim long took a pho Kim long time to bring us our food.  Food was very ok.  Nothing to write home to mom about...\nWould come here again because of the name....
3,"So here I am, FINALLY writing a review.  I've been here many times and yet, have not taken the time to state why.\n\nI started coming here less than a year ago with my sister and her bf with the recommendation of one of his friends.  Well, I haven't had pho in many years, it was cold, so sure, why not?!\n\nIt was very tasty.  I tend to get the same things with each visit. Egg rolls, chicken wings, and small #15.  All very satisfying and hits the spot each time a craving sneaks up on me.  I do have to say, I now find myself craving the wings (with TONS of fried garlic on top) more then the pho. My mouth is starting water just thinking about those crispy, juicy little things.\n\nThe baby decided she doesn't like the noodles, so I always get a bowl with a little bit of rice and add the soup for her.  She also, recently, decided she likes the egg rolls too.  \n\nI haven't really tried any place else for pho, but I know I should, to see if I really do like it as much as I do.  But for now, this is where I'll be."
3,"It's your last day in Vegas, you lost all your money...on whatever you did...you don't even remember.\nYou're hung over as a mofo.  \nYour breath be all stank like a dead possum.\nYour head feels like it's being squeezed by a hariy giant.\n\nYou get your hot bowl of pho with extra meat for 1 dolla and you feel a little better.\n\nThen you get in your car and drive the 5 hours it's gonna take to get back to LA where you will work your ass off to save enough money to do it all again.\n\nOh 3 servers will come to your table and ask if you are ready to order within 2 minutes of you sitting down.\n\nAnd it all happens 24/7.\n\nOh and it tastes pretty good too."
2,"24 hour pho place.  Check.  Besides that, I really can't say that much about Pho Kim Long.  The decor is nice and there is a cool fish tank that definitely brings this pho joint up a notch, but the pho itself is slightly over priced and not that amazing.  Maybe I am spoiled having lived so close to Westminster for so long.  I am not saying that this is bad pho at all, I just was not impressed.  \n\nThe second thing that bothered me was that it took forever to be served and to get our food.  Usually pho only takes a few minutes to get everything in the bowl and then it is in your belly in no time.  I felt like this was the longest pho meal ever.\n\nI probably won't be back anytime soon, unless I really really want pho and I can't find any other pho place to go to.  I expected more Pho Kim Long.  You let me down."
3,Great hangover Pho if you ask me!
0,"I am currently sitting in the middle of the dining room feeling as if no care is given by management.Horrible and disrespectful service.  food came out very fast but was extremely cold as if it was cooked an hour ago. Actually it was a fried egg roll and it was cold inside and out so of course it has been sitting for a long time. When we asked for the food to be hot, the waiter said, \""it is hot\"". such bad service and I am even taking in consideration that it is an Asian restaurant where service is not the number 1 concern or priority. I am sitting in my seat right now waiting for a manager, getting looks from my waitress as if I am lying about cold food. Unbelievable."
4,"A bit of a wait, but that's expected for a popular joint. Best pho ever!  Kind and fast service with great food! Open 24 hrs and near the strip. \nEven if you are not into pho, they have great selection of different varieties. Liked this place so much ate here twice during the same Vegas trip."
1,"Pho wasnt all that great, but a great way to cure a hangover...\nbroth wasnt good and the waiters and waitresses forgot alotta things that we ordered."
3,"My inner Vietnamese Pho snob wants to give this place 3 stars. My hungry Vegas cheap college student wants to give this place 4. So let's settle for 3.5.\n\nParking: nice little private lot right in front. Yay I love vegas, you never have trouble looking for parking like in LA.\nService: very attentive. They have a freaking army of servers even at 1AM. I was very mindblown. They came by to refill water once or twice, gave us an excess of lemons when we asked for more lol . \nFood: definitely the best.pho.ever. A very big bowl contains not that much noodles and beef. But I very much enjoyed the warm comfort food at 1AM in the cold dessert weather after clubbing. MMM MMM MMM. Prices are a little jacked up.... but we have to deal because there aren't that many pho places close to the Strip that are open late-nights. Very FRESH and clean bean sprouts. I was very impressed! All the legit leaves were there too!\n\nWe paid and were about to leave. DUN DUN. Ice and Coco for E's Ice Loves Coco came in. THEY EAT PHO?!?! Mindblown part 2. Just for that, I gave Kim Long the extra half a star for their coolness! Will be back the next time I'm hungry for some cheap eats late at night in Sin City :)"
3,"My go to place for Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice!\nAdd in a side order of their crunchy good spring rolls and I'm set. Fast, almost always friendly service, and I've always wondered how that night manager, at least he looks like the manager, is able to stay that skinny when he is surrounded by all this food..."
2,"This place is cool, not only cause the name, but the hours. The food's pretty good, ordered pho and you can get extra broth for just $1. The service is alright, like any other mom and pop asian place. We had a problem with our check and the man was being very rude about it. I'm sure there are numerous large parties that come through the restaurant and want to split checks or pay partial cash, partial card. The man was just being very impatient and fussy and the funny part is they weren't even busy at the time, he was probably just having a bad day. The prices are reasonable too and the food is good. But this is the place to be after a long night of partying or to cure your hangover in the morning!"
3,"Food quality: 4/5\nThe pho here is awesome! I loved my pho tai chin with some bo vien. It wasn't too hot and the noodles didn't stick together. The one thing I wasn't impressed with was the spring rolls which are something my girlfriend and I almost always get with our pho, hence the 4/5.\n\nCustomer service: 5/5\nIt's good for any sort of asian food place. The people were courteous, kept my water filled without me asking, and delivered the bill promptly/returned the receipts.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\nThe place is in the heart of asian town on Spring Mountain Rd. It's nice inside and smells strongly of pho (which is why you're going here, right??). The one thing I disliked was the fish tank looked quite unkempt while I was there, but that could have been something they were in the process of cleaning or something... Still, minus one star."
0,"I typically rate places based on food and food alone. However this is an exception and will explain why.\n\nMy husband and his friends stopped here (at my recommendation and others) for lunch and enjoyed delishly prepared and priced food. The group walked out the door when my husband realized he left his phone on the table.\n\nHe turned back around (maybe 1 minutes time passed) went to the table where it was being cleaned and asked the waiter did someone see my phone it was right there. To which the guy replied \""no\"" and kept \""working\""\n\nAnnoyed and confused the group returned to the hotel by cab. I decided to whip out my phone and locate his.\n\nLow and behold we look at the iphone locator only to find that the iphone (30 min later) was in a car in the employee parking lot behind the restuarant. We were mid-tanning so we figured we'd head over there in the next hour. An hour later it was still thre so they try and hail a cab and locate the phone only to see it moving- in the car that the EMPLOYEE---\n\n\n\nEat at your own risk- keep your phones hidden these employees have no common courtesy."
0,"Pho Kim Long....more like Pho Kim Wrong.\n\nHORRIBLE, RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, DISRESPECTFUL \""MANAGER\"" \n\nI was just at this establishment (at approx. 2:30am) and it was just appalling. I have been here a couple times before and I wasn't expecting such horrible \""management\"" skills from their \""manager\"". The service staff wasn't so bad. Throughout the meal our cups were filled and they made sure everything was up to par. Everything was running smoothly up until the bill arrived. I was in a party of 4 and we needed a split check. We went up to the register to pay and it took a while for anyone on staff to assist us. Once we ask for a split check one server gave us a dumbfounded look and walked away from the register. Then another man went to the register and flat out said \""We don't do split checks.\"" \n\n*Sidenote*\nI have been here before around the same time and they were able to do a split check without any hassle. \n\nI told the guy that they were able to fulfill the request last time but he said, \""Thats impossible, not without my approval\"". He was very rude and when I was explaining this to him he was practically ignoring me and a my group while he was counting money from another party. Flat out ridiculous. He also charged my friend our whole check before we were told we couldn't split it and faked a void. \n\nNO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE FOR FOOD ON THE STRIP LATE AT NIGHT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY BETTER OFF AT SOME GREASY DRIVE THRU THAN PHO KIM LONG."
0,Worst experience ever. DO NOT EAT HERE.The only reason I'm giving one star is because the potstickers were amazing. But that is the only good thing about this restaurant. The service we horrible. The waiters throw things on the table and don't  check back and the check was never brought. The cashier was highly disrespectful and rude. Do not eat here. There are other Vietnamese restaurants in town. Find a more friendly location.
1,Boyfriend and I wasn't impressed \nPho was decent \nBut the bun bo hue was very bland. I also had ask for a hot tea Togo and the guy said they don't do Togo hot teas? How interesting
0,Smelled like they wiped all their tables with dirty smelly rags... I can't eat in these conditions.
2,I mean what can you say about this place that hasn't already been said 1000 times. \n\nFood is always spot on but service is awful!\nWe use to have decent service but past 2 times mine or my fianc\u00e9s food has come out wrong. The servers rarely pay attention to you when you are speaking which is why it comes out wrong.
1,"I love Pho. I love it a lot actually. It's my go to food any time I am feeling subpar. \n\nWhen I was released from the hospital and craving comfort and a quick start to my system I came her. It was 2 AM on a Wednesday and they were kind of busy. My friend and I were immediately sat and 2 seconds later water was being dropped off and a little lady came over to our table and took our order, I stated I needed a few minutes.\n\nWe ordered spring rolls and two differnt kinds of pho, beef and vegan.\n\nThe food came out quickly. The spring rolls seemed as if they had been sitting around because they were all different colors and some of the innards of the roll were mushy. The peanut sauce was also a little off.\n\nOur pho came out a few minutes later. (The food came out so quickly) My pho was okay, but not great. Definitely disappointed. \n\nAlthough it satiated my Pho-fix. It wasn't that good. I wasn't impressed. I don't get what the hype is about... I personally think it's the tongue-in-cheek, punny name sake.\n\nPho Long, I will not be back. I can make my own punnies too."
2,"losing a star.  Since they've gone to 24/7 hours, the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down.  They turn so many tables I don't think they care about service anymore.  Still the best spot for viet food in LV but viet food shouldn't be too expensive, it's comfort food from a 3rd world country!"
2,"Good lunch spot, although it took some time to get our servers attention. We both ordered Pho and it was delicious. Mine (with various meats) and his (chicken) came out very quickly and had nice flavor. We were seated at a giant round table even though it was just the two of us and our 1 year old. They child seemed to have thrown them off, but overall the experience was good."
3,Pho isn't alwasy Pho.  You can end up with some terrible broths.  This place is always consistant and super busy.  I like that sometimes I have to wait in line.  It reminds me that I'm not the only one who likes this place for lunch
0,"Ugh!!! I used to come here every Saturday after Japanese school with my mom. \nI have FOND memories here, but something has happened. Something terrible...... \n\n - The servers don't speak English nor do they speak any other Asian language. \n - I ordered tea and got a green tea bag in my mug... A MUG!! ... GREEN TEA!! \n - The small dish for dipping is a deep black little cup (customary for ketchup or ranch) \n\n\nIf you know Pho.. AUTHENTIC PHO you know those three points are enough for a strike. \n\nThe taste has declined and I was SO incredibly disappointed. \n\nHighly Americanized and the awful parking lot really doesn't make this place worth your time or calories."
2,"Came in late last night for dinner and saw a short line of people. Fortunately, service was swift enough and both me and my bf got seated almost immediately. \n\nThis place is busy! Noticed that patrons tend to be either party-goers or families. Food is ok, not fantastic. I got the rice noodle with barbecued pork and egg rolls while my bf got his usual chicken pho. Didn't think too highly of the food, but when you are starving, it actually left me pretty satisfied. I can see myself coming here before going out for a party or after a clubbing night. \n\nOne of those places to go to if you are looking for comfort food."
1,"If you want to wait 30 mins just to place your order, come to this place. Food is great but the service is lacking."
0,"Worst customer service in existence!   It's kinda funny to see this in this day and age.   But,  if of don't mind the attitude the food is good."
0,"i was the first time came to Las Vegas,I was so hugely when I arrived this resturant,I feel bad when I arrived,bad service,late food and bad food,I don't want to came again."
3,Place is very busy but well worth the wait. People in town say it's the best pho place to eat. My food has been amazing both times I have been there this week. Our server didn't listen to my order and when I told her it was wrong but I ate it she didn't care lol. I will still go back because it's that good.
1,"My friends and I came to Pho Kim Long to eat dinner around 8PM. Upon first impressions, I liked the decor of the restaurant. It was nicely decorated and roomy. We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50). \n\nHere came the most disappointing part. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn't too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn't think that it was too good. The broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the \""special\"" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. \n\nAt this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend's fried rice finally came out. It didn't look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all...\n\nI don't know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I'm sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened. It's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! I most likely wouldn't visit Pho Kim Long to eat again unless I desperately needed some soup or Pho late at night!"
2,"Came here to satisfy my late night hunger. Open 24/7! This place is ok. Nothing close to amazing but satisfying enough for me. They don't have tripe & their boba is nasty & old. Full of loud drunk people & couples who are arguing for everyone to hear. I guarantee you will get a free show to go with every meal, entertaining & full of drama if you come after 12!"
3,"When I'm not eating pho, my other options are chicken pad Thai which theirs are good and Hong Kong style chow mein (crispy noodles). Every dish I have tried has been satisfying, can't complain. This spot is great for after drinking with friend, just lately the wait has been approximately 20 minutes. Vegas heat sucks!!!"
2,"The 24/7 pho spot. I've been here a few times. One time at 7 in the morning they were bumping EDM. Not cool when you're hungover. Other than that, the food is decent."
0,Service is horrible !  Simple as that \nI felt like regulars and member of the same race was being favored I waited 15 mins for the table which doesn't bother me at all ! If your busy that's fine \nI sat down and waited for 10 mins no water or anything was brought to me ... 20 mins passed I flagged down a busser and informed him I was ready to order can he notify my sever 30 mins passed \nAnd nothing I told my wife to just wait a lil longer and nothin \nAfter 35 mins they can we ordered and I waited for my 23 mins for my food it arrived I ate and had to wait another 24 mins for my check ...
2,Food is getting worse and worse every time I came. I get very disappointed even though this is nice place. :((
4,"I love this place.. great friendly, professional and effective service... I came here years ago after my car accident. Now I come with my girl 2 x a week.. Chong is my favorite doc.. They always have plenty of candy... And they are keeping the SHASHI in there somewhere..."
4,"We went here today to get a new windshield for my Nissan Xterra (fix it ticket ick). And honestly I was not looking forward to the pain my pocketbook was going to be feeling from this one (once we asked ourselves if paying the ticket would be cheaper than the windshield- HA) But honestly, United had the best price quote of anyone in the city and that's why I chose them. The side benefit from selecting them was that there was no wait for us this morning (we got in at almost 9am) and they were super friendly and all around excellent to deal with."
4,"Jeep wrangler Rubicon 7 Windows and strip on the front. Limo tint on the back 5, MN 35 on the driver and passenger. Total was $160 super nice accommodating folks and the tint looks amazing!"
4,"THE most legit glass shop in town. They've worked on two of my cars on a few separate occasions & have done nothing but an awesome job. While some glass shops leave you with wind noise, crooked glass, purple tint, or just a messy job in general, United Auto Glass very professionally installed original Lexus glass."
1,"The concept is great. Cheap groceries. A good selection of produce. Slam dunk right? Sadly, for me, it isn't.\n\nThis location is small (I havent been to others) and with everyone pushing around shopping carts, there is no room to walk around and grab the produce or items I need.\n\nThe prices are great, but the quality of the produce isn't the best. It's always hit or miss. A good example...Each morning, I squeeze myself a glass of orange juice from the market. Mariana's tends to be a tad cheaper than the ones at Food 4 Less, but the Mariana's oranges look like they are the red-headed step child of beautiful navel oranges. Bumpy, and they look abnormally large. I don't want steroids in my fruit or my baseball players. I don't even know if you can roid up fruit, but these oranges do NOT look natural.\n\nI'll pay a buck more for piece of mind. Oh yeah, and Food 4 Less is across the street."
2,"Went there on Friday for menudo but it tasted horrible.  It usually tastes good on the weekend, so not sure if I got an old batch or what.   I am going to try again on the weekend and hopefully it will taste better."
2,"So I went back to this place to try something off the rest of the menu.  My husband and I both ordered the pho with well done beef.  While I was impressed with the freshness of the sprouts, the soup left a bit to be desired.  The beef was really fatty and the noodles were really over cooked.  I know asian places are not known for their customer service but when I ordered a drink with a number instead of the name, the waitress about crapped herself.  She yelled in shock as if I was trying to order two entrees.  At least the gentlemen who work there were friendly."
2,"if you don't feel like eating the pho at treasure island and you are in need of a massive hangover cure, i would definitely venture out here to have some authentic pho.\n\nthe pho at pho vietnam wasn't the best i ever had and the cha gio (eggrolls) were oddly pale even though they were fried.  the iced coffee came already prepared rather than from a slow drip.  this is a good place to come if you have a large party and you don't want a wait.  it's also in the same plaza as ranch 99."
4,Service guy came right out that same morning I called in. He was friendly and knowledgable. Had my TV repaired that same day. The other TV repair company had installed an incorrect lamp. Now my TV looks great.
4,One of the best Mani-Pedi's I've ever had. Very clean and professional.
3,I enjoyed the foot massage and they did great job on my nails
4,Best nail place! I been coming here for over 10 years now! It feels like home!! Great job'! Moderate price! I come and it relaxes me! Their pedi and massage chairs are the best! I truly recommend it! They are very nice! And the work is amazing! I trust them! You won't regret it!
4,"I do get my nails done here and there.. when I feel like it. However, this is the ONLY place i have been where the have the newest up to date acrylics: shimmer-sparkles- AND colors OH MY! to choose from. I recently moved and still keep in contact to say hello with my girl. SHE MADE MY NAILS LOOK LIKE SHINY JEWELS!!!  The Price is fair for the precise and neat work that is done. Around $35/40 (new) depending. I usually would get a shimmer acrylic on the tips then would fill later. No second thoughts.. if you walk in its worth the wait. :) I have recommended MANY friends here. Nails would never pop off, i would ask to soak or drill down to take off."
3,I hate getting my nails done in this city until now!! Not the cleanest place I've ever been too but here's the T. Walked in the am and and got an appointment immediately! Mani and pedi gel we are off to a good start. They didn't have both colors that I wanted but it's no shade. Pedi and mani were quick and she got the job done! I hate waiting for hours to get my nails done. I'm a busy lady and I need to get in and out! So if you're looking for a great place that gets the job done book your appointment now! Again it's not the classiest place but they do great nails for Vegas
2,"I don't like this store as it's woefully understaffed but I did just have a wonderful customer service experience for a little brown boy named Josh. That's enough for me to start thinking about coming here again not just out of necessity.\n\nRest assured, this would be 1-star if it wasn't for the great service experience."
0,"TRES VECES, la orden me ha salido mal!  No recomiendo este lugar para comida salvadorena.\n\nTrate darle otra oportunidad pero despues de haber recivido la comida mal en tres diferentes ocasiones, ya no mas!\n\nEl pollo, el pescado simple y reseco!  Y cuando se le comunica el problema no se hacen responsables.  Muy mal servicio!\n\nBusquen otro restaurante salvadoreno!!! No pierda su tiempo ni su dinero."
1,This Starbucks is pretty disorganized.  Every time I've been in this place I wait much much longer in line than I would've if I would've gone through the drive thru.  So frustrating.  This Starbucks needs some management and better cleaners.
0,"The last Macaroni Grill that I ate at was back in 2008 with my boyfriend (now husband) and we LOVED it. The atmosphere was great and it was reasonably priced.\n\nWe ate here for lunch with my parents right after we got into Vegas because Urbanspoon indicated that they had gluten free options (for my mom and sister). \n\nAnd here is where I want to go into a little rant. If you're in the food industry, you should care about food. (I'm not talking about teenagers working as waitresses at a TGIFridays.) I'm talking about managers of restaurants who charge more than $12/plate. \n\nI don't appreciate watching someone become rude with my mother while she makes sure my sister doesn't get sick by eating YOUR FOOD. \n\nManagement didn't help at all and the waitress couldn't have looked more bored. No one asked us if our food was good (because it wasn't...it was greasy) and I don't plan on going back to any Macaroni Grill in the near future."
4,"Loving this place.  Yah it's a chain.  So what?  They provide a quality product at a fair price consistantly.  The chianti is great with any pasta on the menu.\n\nI always opt for the \""create your own pasta\"".  Very reasonable and you can pick from four sauces, five or six pastas and add veggies, meat whatever you want.  Not a bad deal.  Home baked bread is 5 stars!"
1,"Went in for a meal on Sunday night.  Not a great move.  The food was really not great even for a chain italian place.  Service was good, we sat at the bar to watch the Sunday night game.  \n\nI'm still not sure if the issue was the poor food, the poor menu, or something I can't nail down."
1,"Not thrilling.\nWe ordered take out for the office today, got a few lunch combos whole wheat fettuccine and soups, along with a couple salads.\nBut when I informed the cashier that I wanted the daily special soup instead of the tomato, as I am allergic to tomatoes, this did not seem to affect my receiving the tomato soup, and the whole wheat fettuccine meal was bland, dry with very fatty chicken, no comment from the salad eaters.\nThe tiramisu was very nice though, hence the two stars."
1,"Mediocre. They gave us no spoons, took way too long to bring the viddles, I received a tiny cup of tartar sauce for my fish, and the prices were too high. Not so clean either, but I'm glad my boyfriend took me here, because now I know I don't want to go back :P"
0,"I took my family here on Valentine's Day. What a disaster! The 45-minute wait was to be expected given that it was Feb. 14, but the hour-long wait to get our food wasn't. Plus, the food was terrible. The clam chowder had some weird spice in it and was congealed. Ick! The burger had a soggy bottom bun. The lobster bisque was gross. It tasted like butter and cream with very little lobster. The only thing I liked was the wedge salad (but it's hard to mess up a chunk of lettuce sprinkled with bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes.) We were all disappointed and will never go back."
0,"This is my 1st review and I'm taking it way back, over a year ago to our visit at Landry's. I had a gift card for this restaurant that I picked out as a reward from work. Came at lunch with my fam of 5, my parents and Aunty. \n\nFirst off we were the only customers and service took way too long. If it was super busy I'd understand....My dad(not the pickiest eater) actually complained that his soup was too salty. They took it away but didn't return it with another or say sorry or anything. It was awhile back but the food was not memorable at all. \n\nWorst part about the visit was they told me the card couldn't be used this time. Every single time I and my co-workers used this type of gift card we Never had a problem. They had this long explanation that it had to be mailed and next visit they would honor the discount yada yada yada and some other confusing stuff. \n\nAnywho I just wanted to get this bad visit (service and food) off my chest. Unfortunately after all this time still not forgotten. Hopefully I can move on. Bad on me I didn't question the gift card issue more(although and at least we spoke to manager at the time). And demand a new soup for my dad. A bad but learning experience nonetheless."
2,"Came in for lunch with family. Food was great however the service today was not.  We ordered our drinks and it took the waitress about 20 mins to come back with them after she served a group of 6 that came in after us.  She had someone else bring us our drinks and it was probably because I kept looking around to find her.  When she came to take our order she seemed like she didn't really want to be at work or something because her response to our questions were one word.  I ordered the king crab with a baked potato and asked for the crab to be cracked and no chives on my potato. After placing our order, she tells us in a rude manner \""is that all\"".  The complimentary salad was not fresh and taste odd. Once we received our order, the server placed a \""hot\"" plate in front of my son and swooshed his hand when he attempted to touch it.  I understand not wanting him to burn himself but why place it directly in front of him if it's that hot?  The plate was not hot at all as the server mentioned and I was pretty upset with her swooshing my son's hand away.  When my king crab and potato came, it was not cracked and I had an overwhelming amount of chives on my potato.  I did not receive anything to crack them with, butter, or anything that normally comes with a crab lunch/dinner order.  I asked if they could be taken back and cracked and the server says \""oh I forgot to put that in the computer\"". Not a problem. She takes them back and it takes 10 mins to get them back. We eat our meal, and our server does not return for quiet sometime. We see her waiting on other tables but she never makes it back to our table until I begin looking around for her again. She finally comes and ask if we need anything and refills our drinks.  We finish our meal, pay and leave. We have never had bad service prior to this visit, and I give 3 stars because the food was good as always. Service could have been so much more better. Hopefully next time we visit it will be great service."
2,"The staff hears what they want to hear. They don't really care what you say or order. I mean, I barely got \""cafe\"" out of my mouth and the dude was already gone. What if I didn't want condensed milk, huh? What of that? Same thing for pho orders. And AND the menu had me flustered due to their lack of rice plates. Who does that? Who doesn't have just charbroiled pork as the first thing on the list of rice plates? \n\nDespite my complaints, the egg rolls were excellent! Loads of filling in them! And the coffee was old school, with the metal drip thing and the cup of ice. Pho was good, but something about 105 degree heat makes me not want to eat a big hot soupy bowl of pho."
2,"Of course going to Vegas with my Vietnamese family meant getting our pho fix on at least once in Vegas during our stay, this time, it was on our way out from Vegas. This is one of the better pho restaurants in Vegas, they have everything on their menu and reasonably priced too! Their service is kinda sucky, but I guess that's understandable since this place is packed all hours of the day until closing. I guess this place is the place to be when you need your pho fix. Obviously they're not as good as what you can find in your mom's kitchen or possibly out in Bolsa but its decently priced and tastes good enough. This is obviously a come-back place. duh. lol."
2,"This was our first foray into Vietnamese food since moving to LV.  What can I say?  It wasn't bad.  But it wasn't anything to write home about.  If I could I'd give it a 2.5.  I decided to round up for now.  \n\nWe tried pho, bun, and spring rolls.  We liked the spring rolls (though the sauce was a bit watery and too salty).  The bun (vermicelli) was pretty good.  The pork was nicely seasoned but they skimped on the shrimp.  The pho broth felt a little light...could've been more flavorful.  But the worst part?  It left both my husband and me feeling dehydrated and with dry mouths.  Sure signs of MSG overdose.  Yuck-O!  :("
3,"I've heard a lot about this place from other Yelpers, but I've also read the stigma that comes with this place: Long waits, bad service, bringing out wrong items....  But people claimed the food was good, so I decided to toss myself to the ring and see what happens.\n\nI'm not a major pho fan.  My experience largely extends to cracking jokes of the \""Pho real\"" variety (yes, this is what I do).  For all the concern, however, none of the problems listed in reviews really happened in my experience.  Fast service, it sometimes took a moment to get the server's attention, but they were attentive when you did, they brought out something that we didn't ask for... not as a mess up, but they had an extra and offered the side dish for us to try just because.\n\nThe food itself?  Again, pho is not my usual first choice, but it's good to break out of the comfort zone, and to all credit, the food was tasty.   It was all well cooked, flavorful, and diverse.  I enjoyed it, felt full, and had a pleasant lunch.  Really, that's all I want from a dining experience.\n\nWhen the check came, the price was not bad at all.  Two people for less than $20 is NOT a bad deal.\n\nIf I have another experience like this, I'll gladly return here.  As I said, pho is not usually my first meal craving, but the experience that I had here will ensure that it won't be my last."
2,"I usually never have a car when I', in Vegas but I did one time and I came here for a Pho run. Although it's not the BEST pho I've had I think it's pretty good for Pho in Vegas, where there are plenty of non-authentic Asian food on the strip. The prices were pretty reasonable for pho so no complaints there.\n\nWe ordered the Pho Dac Biet and eggrolls... I think I've had bigger bowls of Pho in the SGV but their soup was piping HOT when it came out, which I loved! I hate lukewarm soup... The veggies all looked pretty clean and washed so that was also a plus. \n\nOverall, I would come back if I had a car, but with it being off the strip, I'm not sure that I would taxi it all the way here and back,,,"
3,"I love Pho Meatball Soup and this place delivers. It isnt the best I have had ever but its the best I have had in Vegas. Pho in Seattle is everywhere and the market is developed where Vegas is much more limited in selections of Pho. The places here seem to be a bit less in quality than Seattle because their isn't the stiff competition, but this place was pretty tasty. I had #16 Pho w Meatball and I had the tendon one a day or two later. Both were very good and was what should be expected. I have not ventured into much else on the menu yet, but I would highly recommend, as for Las Vegas Pho this does the job pretty well."
1,"Doesn't even taste like pho, nor smell like it.\n\nI had asked for extra veggies in my vermicelli, and it looked like they put in less than most places normally would if i had not asked for extra. This plate was ok.\n\nMy seat had a bunch of rips in it, and when you sit on ripped leather it kinda hurts if you wear a dress/shorts."
0,"I had such high hopes for this place because of the high reviews, but i was sadly disappointed, my pho dac biet arrived so clear i could see all the way to the bottom of the bowl, i had never had pho broth that was extremely clear i feel like they just gave me a bowl of salt water with noodles and beef in it...after i got done eating i felt like i had a belly full of seawater. This is the second pho place i have tried and will not be back, i recommend jenni pho instead."
4,Bun Bo Hue.... that is all I have to say. You don't always find bun bo hue with that much flavor but this place has it all. I'll be back for sure
1,Dont eat here its nasty and they recycle their food.. The only good thing about this restaurant is its damn cheap hhahaha if you are cheap and want cheap quality of food then you eat here you cheap ass hahahah
3,"My name is Gavin. I am a pho-a-holic. Let my share my story. \n\nI am a weekly regular here at Pho So1 for a reason! Having tried many pho places in LV, I keep coming back to this one for one thing...THE SOUP. This is the hands down best pho in Vegas. No questions. It's food crack, really. I just can't get enough. The broth has mystical powers and calls to me at strange times, begging for my return. The noodles and meat mingle in the bath of harmonious flavor and never fail to make me mmmmmmmm. Always order the Dac Biet #10 if you're really hungry or 14 if you're just normal. Tender brisket, delicious flank, melty chewy tendon and tripe if you want it. It's heaven in a bowl, baby. It'll cure what ails ya. Thank you Pho So1, for making me an addict.\n\nOnly words of wisdom, avoid the lunch rush on the weekend especially and order quickly.. Some days they get crazy busy and service suffers. Still, I love em to death."
3,"PROS: Delicious, hot food! The egg rolls (#1) are crazy good. I go here all the time and order completely different things each time, and I'm never disappointed. I've tried everything from soup to rice dishes! the taste is authentic and great :) \n\nit's cheap($13 and below), healthy, and comes in big portions, which I love! \n\nIf you ask, they are happy to tell you what the most popular, most delicious items are. Mainly because the list to order from is pretty long! \n\nCONS: The service can be either excellent or iffy depending on who is serving you. \n\nSometimes getting a table can be a bit of a wait. \n\nBathrooms need to be cleaned better! lol"
4,Got introduce here by my ex boss. Really nice place to have lunch or dinner. Food are great. I'd say A+ to their service. Will come here more often.
0,"About 3 weeks ago I came to this place to eat pho, my experience with pho was really bad..slow down on the MSG, you don't want to kill the customer before they can finished their food and to day I got vietnames upon noodles (banh canh). Do you think all of your customers is stupid. When you say pork,shrimp, and crab the customer expect everything to be included not missing and say that it doesn't come with it. You charge me extra for it, when I can just get the regular for the figure price."
4,"We've been coming here for a while now and it's always a great experience.  Right when you walk in and get seated, right away you get a glass of water and get a few moments to look through the menu. Once you place your order the wait is not too long. comes out nice and hot and great portion also. the customer service on the other hand can learn how to smile, be up beat, and look like they want to help. besides all that great place to eat!! \n\nwe order number 14 on the menu most of the time. we would recommend it."
0,Pho broth is no good. Service is no good. There are plenty of other pho places in the area. This one was not worth my time and money.
1,"So the family drove all the way to Vegas from LA to eat at a subpar Pho restaurant.  This is so typical of an Asian family.  So we walked in with a party of 15 and it took 10-15 minutes for us to get seated.  I understood that as this is not a normal sized party.  I ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pho xe lua.  First off, I noticed how much more they charged here compared to LA.  \nThe spring rolls were just ok.  Didn't have much flavor to it.  The dipping sauce did help, but still not that good.  My pho came out and I wasn't sure it was mine because it was a regular sized bowl.  From my experience, xe lua is supposed to be an extra large.  I thought that's why I paid extra for it.  I even asked the server and he said that the xe lua was the same as the dac biet.  \nI was confused, but I still ate it and didn't make a big deal about it.  When I took my first bite, I was underwhelmed by the taste.  The soup didn't have that much flavor even after putting in the hoisin, veggies and lime.  The noodles wasn't fresh tasting like I'm used to.  I forgot to mention that the food was luke warm.  It's not piping hot like it's supposed to be.  The meat was just ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  \nAll in all, I would not come back to this establishment if I am ever in Vegas and craving for Pho.  There are so many other choices to choose from, and this one really bites.  The thing that really confuses me is that this is part of a chain and there is one located in Van Nuys that taste better than this place.  Food quality is definitely lacking at this Vegas location and they need to re-evaluate their whole business strategy."
2,"Tried this place on the advice of a Vegas local who highly recommend the place. Good place to try if you're craving some pho. \n\nOverall, food was good, nothing spectacular but nothing horrible either. The biggest down side was the service, they weren't rude but it was hard to find any help. Took a while for our server to take our order and for our food to come to us (bigger groups who came in after us received their food first). But after we received our meal, our server was nowhere to be found, we had to ask other servers passing by for help."
3,"BEST BANH MI IN VEGAS\nI compared the banh mi here with Hue Thai Sandwiches and Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant (the one by UNLV).  I liked this sandwich the best of the three.\n\nI ordered the #1 House Special and every bite was fresh tasting.  It measures 9.75\"" long on good bread with fresh ingredients and good meat for $3.  \n\nThere was no one in front of me and I waited about 2 minutes for my sandwich but there can be a line during lunch.  \n\nSee full review of all three sandwiches at www.DeepFriedKimchee.com"
4,"Video poker, topless dancers, 7 am to 7pm happy hour, the DJ is amazing, best party location in Vegas...enough said"
2,"Decided to have dinner at Tofu Hut tonight. Overall experience was not bad, but I wouldn't call it great either. \n\nThey were a bit short staffed when we first walked in. I would say it took them over 5 mins to even acknowledge our presence even though they did see us walk in.  I expected a \""Hello, or Welcome\"" at the very least.\n\nWe passed on the AYCE tonight & went ala carte. We ordered short ribs & spicy chicken. Both orders were good, but nothing memorable or anything to rave about. I did love their banchan offerings! I liked the fish cake, japchae, spicy cucumber, and I don't recall the others but it was yummy!\n\nI would go back.. but don't think I'll be a regular at this place."
1,"Service: 0/5 Wasn't the most welcoming that's for sure. When I walked in I stood in the door way/waiting area for like 5 minutes as I waited and stared at each employee of this place idk maybe because I wasn't Korean I wasn't getting the best service at the door. Finally we got seated, I felt rushed by my waitress and trust me after she dropped off our dishes that was the last time I saw her. She never came back to refill our waters or anything. Flagging someone down just to pay the bill was also an issue no one paid attention to us. \n\nKim Chi Beef: 3/5  I liked their Kim Chi beef but it doesn't compare to other places I've tried. A bit mediocre it was very watery and salty. I had huge chunks of Kim Chi which I liked but I had no idea where he \""beef\"" was. I'm guessing it had to be some sort of ground beef. The tofu was cooked perfect though not too soft not to hard\n\nSeafood Beef: 2/5  My boyfriend got this dish because he loves sea food in this Tofu, but omg super salty it tasted to bland not even tasty. There was barely any sea food in his the only thing I could recall were scallops and they tasted like imitation scallops. The tofu was cooked perfect though not too soft not to hard\n\nSide dishes: 2/5 I actually really liked their assortment of side dishes but our waitress was never around to refill them. I was pretty disappointed."
0,"Korean bbq is so good and I was excited to try this place with all the good reviews. The restaurant is pretty small and grills are at each table. \n\nThe staff wasn't very excited to help my friends and I. It was a quiet night and they could have been a little more excited to have people. They never came to refill our drinks, refill our meat, or our sides. All you can eat- yeah right! :(\n\nThe staff also sat up by the very loud TV the whole time and ignored pretty much any one who didn't need to be seated. They also took 20 min to give us the check. They asked the table next to us to \""hurry up, people need their table,\"" which was pretty rude! The bathrooms were a disaster which makes me wonder what the kitchen/fridge looks like..\n\nI have the feeling had I been Korean the service would have been a bit better...Even my Korean friends agree the service is bad! Major disappointment!! \n\n*Try some place clean where people actually want your business!"
2,"I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine and it is an all you can eat dine in restaurant but only on the left side. The prices range between $15-18 for the all you can eat. They do not have a menu on this side, they basically just have a list of the meats you can choose from and it is unlimited including the sides. I give the food four-stars, as the food is delicious. I love Korean food and sides! However, I need to give the service three-stars. \n\nThe first time I went there it was around 5pm, there was no line and we were seated fairly quickly. We had a lady serving us and she was nice but very hard to flag down. I enjoyed the food there especially the brisket and the sides. I was just not impressed by the service. \n\nThe second time we went there, we decided to go to dinner and we brought our friend with us. I made sure to arrive early to get us seats. The all you can eat side was pretty full so I stood by the sign that says, \""wait to be seated\"". No one was behind me at the time so I did not mind waiting. However, another person arrived and spoke to one of the servers. He decided to seat them first which I'm sure would upset a few people. I spoke to him before he seated them and explained that I was clearly standing there first and he should not have sat them before me as I was waiting and was not with their party. My friends arrived soon after he seated that party of three I was not too happy about that. I had a good time otherwise, but I just feel that in order to get more people into the place, the service has to be just as good as the food. If you don't mind good food, but lousy service, you should try this place."
2,"We had the a la acarte, and sat on the other side.  The other side was for all you can eat with the \""cook your own meat grill\"".  The service was good and fast; which is what you expect at most asian restaurants.  The bulgogi was really good.  I have been looking for a place that had the same taste and flavor as the one back home; and this one is quite similar.\n\nThe only thing was the cleanliness of the restaurant.  It wasn't in tip-top shape.  And, I don't like eating while I have to shoo a fly away.  Next time, I may just have the order to go.  Ohh, and another thing..it was a little pricey than I had expected.  Typically, you can judge at how much a restaurant will be based on looking at the restaurant.  I think the bulgogi was $14?!  A little steep."
3,"Ah KBBQ - I almost didn't believe it when a friend described it as \""all you can eat meat buffett\"" but it was true, and a dream come true!\n\nThere are a couple AYCE KBBQ here in town, most right up in Chinatown on Spring Mtn. For the most part there are same, with some slight variations. Tofu Hut is one my favorite though.\n\nTofu is set-up where they bring the meet to you. Its a small place so there really isn't much room for you to actually go up and get the food yourself. This of course puts you at the mercy of the wait staff. But usually their service is on point and there isn't much of a delay in getting what you want.\n\nThe prices are pretty cheap when compared to some of the other KBBQ joints. AYCE is $17, and they knock off $4 after 10pm. They have the full of assortment of Korean meats: brisket, bulgogi, pork belly, squid, beef tongue, and the like. I absolutely love the Kalbi, its delicious as is the steamed egg. (I have been calling it egg soup and no one has ever bothered to correct me).\n\nDespite the name Tofu.. this place is anything but it. Overall a above average KBBQ spot and a great value."
3,Went here with some friends for the all you can eat dinner. Pretty cheap compare to other place and the food was good. We got seated as soon as there was a table available. We order our meats and our server was very attentive refilling our drinks and bring more meat as we ordered. Everything was great from the beginning. But beware of smelling like Korean food as you leave!
0,We went to Tofu Hut because mr. Tofu is closed on sunday. A few tables were bbqing meat and we ordered one sun-tofu and one guk-su. The side dishes were all suck!! Jab-che was over seasoned with too much soysauce. Kimchi was too old and jun was all burned. One side of jun was all black and tasted nothing more than flour. Sun-tofu was not bad but not good either. We ordered spicy but it wasnt spicy at all. Guk-su was terrible. Too much vinegar was used.. i almost threw up while eating. Staff was not bad. They walj around with ice water and refill it everytime you ask. Overall i will never go back. I cant believe tofu hut became this horrible. It wasnt used to be this bad. I will rather wait until mr. Tofu opens on weekdays. Please do taste before serving dishes to customers!!!
1,"First time back in a long time...It's either gotten worse, or I've learned of better KBBQ in town....or both!\n\nWasn't a big fan of the meats truthfully...the only one that had flavor was the Marinated Pork Belly, and maybe the marinated chicken...the rest were a little boring and tough even after a quick sear.  Pic of the meats : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=zCo32peMlhCJI_0H7q1SUg#zCo32peMlhCJI_0H7q1SUg\n\nPic of the meats cookin' :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=YuJt74AHAnh24_SqZNedLg#YuJt74AHAnh24_SqZNedLg\n\nThe banchan was ok.  Nothing really stood out, but the servings were plentiful.  When we ran out of kimchi, they resupplied quickly after a request.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=vHznYxpqkzfUaFttHH7JUA#vHznYxpqkzfUaFttHH7JUA\n\nOnly half of the dining area has BBQ grills, so expect a wait.  Ours was about 30min, around 930pm on a weekday.  Not a big deal to me, just expect it.\n\nThe only thing they really have going for them are the prices.  It's about $14 for AYCE during 10pm+, so they are almost half price of most places.  But unless you can't afford the extra few dollars out on the town, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for KBBQ."
2,I come here for the AYCE KBBQ. The meat here is better than most KBBQ place in Vegas for almost half the price.  They don't have much of a side order selection but the salad and the sides that come with the meal is good.  The only problem is that half the restaurant is for KBBQ so seating is very limited and it can take very long to get a table when it's busy.  The service is decent.  A server will come around now and then and ask if you want to order more but its hard to get their attention when they are  running around.
3,"Takes a long time to clean up table. But its understandable cos grill is hot n need cool down, i suppose. The price is really good but the meat, especially the short ribs are not tender. \nI would not be a regular here, just because the smell afterward in your clothes is horrific, we suppose plan go Hakasan  right after dinner. But once i get in the car, that BBQ smell is just a turn off. So word of advice is that make sure your next stop is shower lol.\n\nI wish there is a 3.5 start, because that is what it earned."
3,"If you are look for a good place to eat at Vegas and it is after 10:00PM this is the place to go. You would want to come with an empty stomach since this place is a All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. I dare you to come out of this place not smelling like Korean BBQ. So if you plan to go to a party after you might wanna bring a change of clothes. If this is your first time trying Korean BBQ let me tell you that the smell will linger on your clothes and hair. \n\nThis is an AYCE location starting at 10:00pm-2:00am and it only cost $18-20 depending on the tipping amount. This is a great deal since NYC prices are outrageous of this type of food. Along with the Korean BBQ meat that you order it comes with Banchan. Banchan are small tradition Korean side dishes such as kimchee, bean sprout, fish cake, pancake etc. If these dishes run out you can always ask for more. I am used to my basket of fresh lettuce but instead they served chop lettuce with some dressing. This is a complete shock to me, maybe the basket of fresh lettuce is a NYC thing. The basket of fresh lettuce here is served like a salad with a fresh sesame dressing. \n\nI will recommend  this brisket, marinated pork belly and sliced sliced rib-eye. I will stay away from the squid because it comes really elastic when it is cooked. The marinated pork belly was my favorite because it comes with so much favor. Keep in mind that this place does not change the Korean BBQ grill. Since the pork belly is marinated the grill turns black quicker and they will not replace it until you finish the dinner. \n\nThe restaurant is split into two parts. When you walk in the left side is for Korean BBQ quest. They have 6 tables that can seat 4 people each and 3 long table that can hold at least 8 individuals. The right side are for guest who do not want to eat Korean BBQ but just want Korean food. \n\nThe only reason this place lost a star is because of service and the wait. I came at 10:03pm and had to wait for an hour to get seated. The service is slow and they seem like zombies. When the table before us finish eating it took 10 minutes to clean the table and when the table was clean the waitress did not call us until another 10 minutes has passed. So the turn around rate for the table is around 20 minutes because they lack the help. Since only two people are working it takes a lot longer for wait and the meat to come out. If they hired more help this place would have earn five stars. \n\nHint: When you walk in place your name, time you came in and number in your party on that sheet of paper near the door. This place get pack after 10:15pm!"
2,"I always come here during lunch because they have good specials on the tofu soup! It's cheap, delicious & comes with a lot of food! And usually the service is quick- not too long of a wait.\n\nHowever, I ate here for dinner the other night and the wait was ridiculously long! It was just a party of 2 but we waited over an hour. What made me angry was the fact that there were seats open!! There were at least 4 tables open but they didn't fill those up. They made us wait an hour and they finally sat us- at the table that was open this entire time!!! \nWe did the all you can eat and it was only $16.99. Lots of food & it was good~ love their short ribs!!\nIt's good, cheap food but you just have to wait a looooong time!"
4,"Best Korean BBQ in Vegas. Love their marinated pork belly and squid. Their salad is addicting. Staff is friendly. Can be a long\nwait on weekend nights, but that's to be expected. My go to Korean BBQ spot!"
2,"A La Carte menu:\nI've been to Tofu Hut plenty of times before and no other Korean place I've went to had tofu soup comparable to this place. Sometimes salty, but nonetheless distinctive. I usually order the Bulgogi combination and Short Rib combination which are about $13-14 each including soups and sides. For the price, the food is quite a bit and enough to get a group of three to four full which is great. I tend to finish up the sides too. Rice cake, noodles, spiced cucumbers, kimchi, beans sprouts-yummy.\n\nDownsides?:\nBulgogi was overcooked this time I went... not too much of a biggie because the short ribs were perfect. The biggie was customer service. When I asked one of the employees politely for a refill of a side, she walked right past me without acknowledging me, then returned later just taking the dish without saying anything or looking at me. She quickly came back with a refill but I found it rather rude not being acknowledged at all...as if I wasn't there. Not cool. Overall, service is inconsistent every time I head here. Depends on server of course, but everyone on Yelp knows I love friendly people and tip generously for it. For Tofu hut, I realized not to expect much from staff anymore.\n\nI like eating here for quick fix Korean. If it wasn't for my affinity towards the soup here, I'd prefer the ambiance and experience at Soyo (located Rainbow Blvd/Warm Springs)"
1,This place is very small. I had to wait for 1hr to be seated.  The food was not the best because the grill was not working. I think I ate raw pork and chicken because the grill was messed up. There was so much smoke coming from our grill that they didn't brother to fix it after we were done eating raw meat. Place was too small and not worth going even if the price was cheap.
0,"This place gets my vote for the worst KBBQ experience ever. The meats were awful and poor quality. Also worth mentioning is their horrible banchan. It was not fresh nor did it taste good. I usually ask for seconds or thirds when it comes to banchan too. It made me really miss the L.A. KBBQ joints. The soon tofu was extremely, uncomfortable spicy! It gave me really bad heartburn. I can handle spicy food too."
0,We went there last night around 12:30am. Tofu Hut was open for another hour and a half. Two families of 6 were seated and immediately after the lady working there told us we were not welcome to eat there after we've already waited 15 minutes to eat.\n\nI'm not sure why exactly we were profiled and there were several open tables.
2,"I honestly love love Korean Barbecue. It is my absolute favorite thing to do! Tofu hut is a great place to get KBBQ. I love this place. The meat is great, the marination is a little sweet but Americans would love them. The meat that they give you is frozen. Like they had a frozen block of meat and cut them right before they give it to you so the meat is frozen when they bring it to you. \nThe salad is great, a little salty but still good. A long with the kimchi, salty but good. Their other sides are pretty good as well. I love love the pickled cucumber.\nAnd I don't know if it's an Asian thing or it's just them but they're very \""not attentive\"" if that makes sense. Like they could careless about their customers. Every time we asked for something, they always give us this \""ugh, again?\"" face. I'm Asian myself and I've worked with a lot of customers but I would never do that. They're stingy and doesn't want to give you the food. I had to order brisket and beef tongue like 3 times before I got them. If they were busy I would understand but no one was there. They just seemed very careless. \nFood quality wise, it's very good and delicious. \nCustomer service wise, it was pretty bad. \nThey charged us the 18% gratuity and there was only 4 of us in our party so that's another thing. I don't mind tipping at all, I really don't. I do it according to the service that was provided but the service was pretty bad. \nUsually I give more then 18% but since they want just 18% I just let them. \nIf you're looking for good food and don't care about service, I say go for it! \nIf you want service and don't want to cook your own food, I say pass."
3,This place is great.  The staff is really friendly and the chile verde burrito is fantastic.  You know a mexican restaurant is good when most of the customers are hispanic.  I eat here for lunch three or four times a week.  Best cheap mexican food in Vegas.
2,"All of the same things I wrote 2 yrs ago still apply here.  Great spot with a great selection of jewelry and watches.  Service is still spotty, but if you happen to be there when Ladera is working, she'll take good care of you.  She's very friendly and knowledgable about the items in the store.  She will also check for you if there's any room for negotiation.  Other than that her, most of the other people who work here are not as friendly.\n\n4 Stars for product offering, 2 Stars for spotty service.  Ladera gets a solid 4 Stars.  This is still on my rotation of shops to visit when I'm back in Vegas.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%"
2,"24/7 Local video poker sports bar, everything you'd expect. It seems like I'm always just stopping in for a cheap breakfast, the Pt's Platter is way better than its Ihop and Denny's counterparts and the waitresses are much friendlier. Unfortunately, I always get sucked into the video poker machines and end up leaving with a full tummy and an empty wallet."
1,"It's good thing I don't like a lot of sales support when shopping for footwear because no one shopping here got any!\nCashier also brusquely informed me that the boots he was ringing up for me \""didn't match\"" without telling me why (I had a left one and a right one in the same size) and stalked away to find some that did. He substituted one of them and clucked loudly when I asked if I could try them on again and stalked back to the register, where I caught up with him to pay for my Ariats, he asked for the \""last 4 numbers on the front of\"" the card he'd just had in his hand, again without telling me why. \nIt's also a good thing I know how to check credit card transactions.\nThis was my second purchase there under less than ideal service circumstances. No charm, no third time."
0,"The owner is very rude. I had been a cust for almost 7 months. I had him order me a price guide $30 , for my comic con trip. I gave him over 3 1/2 months heads up. He gave it to me in sep. Thats over 2 months after comic con. He told me that its not his fault and that i needed to pay for it or get the hell out. I told him that i would leave. On top of that he only takes cash and has had a few run ins with the irs on taxes. A shady guy. Be careful. I never been there again. This guy did me a huge favor. All he did was smoke pot in his store and talk about nasty sex acts he did back in the day ... In front of my wife!!!!!!!! His teeth are all rotted out and on top of that he stands soo close to u. Yuck. I now go to maxim comics the best store in l v."
2,"Some reviews say Steve's a jerk. I wouldn't say that for my experience. It's obvious that regulars get priority. I understand that. Some people like myself want to browse and accidentally find something we can't live without. \n   Shoppers beware though... I wouldn't recommend bringing in kids. I had my 5 yr old daughter with me looking around. Very seedy environment. \""Adult\"" pictures/magazines/cards that are out in the open. If that's your thing, so be it, but comic book stores should be family friendly. After all kids were where it all started. \n    They do have a great selection and Steve is very knowledgeable. Not the kind of place I'll come back to. Sorry.  Put the \""Adult\"" material behind the curtain and I'll be back."
0,"Get out of the business Lowes!  Home Depot knows what they are doing so get out of their way.\nSound harsh?  read on then judge for your'e self.\nI manage 3 4 plex apartments here in las vegas, and needed 2 sets of counter tops for 2 units that I was quoted 1/2 of what Home Depot wanted.  Time was critical these units are being rented by two families that live in their cars currently because they are down on their luck.  (my employer is very generous and rehabs units for low income housing giving people a second chance)\nI went to Lowes on w. charleston and the price was more than 2x what i was quoted on the phone.  I was in a hurry so I ordered them and was assured they would be there on 6-13.  I called 6-13 told they were not in and called 6-14, & 6-15 again told they were not in.  Turns out they were in the whole time but the employees were too lazy too look on the back of the counters to see who they belonged to.\nWhen Lowes finally found the counters they had made a mistake and ordered the wrong size they were both too short.\n6-26 Lowes has the counters in and they are too short a second time.  Store manager  Ben is supremely disinterested and I am pushed off to the counter top guy again.  I explain I need the counter top 8' not 7' he seems to understand this time.  \n6-27 Lowes calls to take measurements themselves because they still haven't ordered the right size yet!  I met counter top guy on site show him I need 8', he leaves assures me he will order as soon as he gets back to store.\n6-28 4:30 pm (today) I get call from Lowes they screwed up the credit card charge and haven't ordered the tops yet!\nMeanwhile I have 2 families living in their cars waiting on counter tops so the county will let them move in and Lowes can't seem to get it together!\nAs if this wasn't enough, I was assured that the area manager Lary Ednes from Lowes would call to help me out with this problem.  Well Larry, its been 3 days and counting; each day I'm assured by your office i will receive a call that day and nothing.\nHelloooo?  Lowes,? is anybody home?\n\nLowes your slogan is \""Lowes never stop improving\"".  Well when are you going to start?"
0,"Do not order service from this store.\nAbysmal customer service from the install sales team.\n\nThey installed a 2 brand new HVAC units on the roof of our duplex.\nThey had to cut into our (NON LEAKING) roof to install it.\nIt leaked.\n\nIt's Las Vegas - you don't find these things out until a really heavy monsoon. We found out less than a year after install. It leaked in both places where they cut the holes for the return ducts. We reported it and the installer came out and supposedly fixed the leaks.\n\nAnother year goes by before another truly heavy monsoon. And the roof is still leaking in the same place on one of the units!!! We call again. This time, it takes over a week to get a customer service person out to look at it. \n\nLowes says the labor is not warranteed after the first year. AND most importantly - THEY HAVE LOST THE RECORD of our reporting THE LEAK the first time around WITHIN the year warrantee period. To top this off - the company Lowes contracted with, Phoenix Air, has gone out of business!\n\nLowes, you really really suck."
1,"Walked in to pick something up from the ship to store department, and the register is closed but next to it is layway and there were 5 people in line and the gentlemen at the register said that the other lane/register is closed.  I told him \""call for help then, because I'm not here for layway\""  2 other ladies in line agreed and said they were waiting too because no one would come help him.   Well it happened that we were near the employee back entrance or something and I told someone in that back hallway to immediately go call someone to help this guy out because we are not all here for layaway and no one is helping him.  Within 2 minutes someone came to help him.   They were still a little slow but not nearly as bad as before.  It still took almost 30 min from the time I came in, to the time I finally got my 2 items and they allowed me to pull around back to pick it up because it was too large to wheel through the store on a flatbed cart.  \n\nNot necessarily poor service but definitely LACK OF HELP to properly take care of customers!"
0,"This location is terrible. I usually don't shop at Walmart, mostly because of their policies and politics, but in this case I was shopping online and they had 1 of the items I was looking for in stock so I ordered for store pick up so I wouldn't have to wait for it to be shipped from another online retailer. When I showed up to pick up my item, I waited for about 30 min in the customer service line before being told I was in the wrong line. Seriously? Why wasn't I told this in the pick-up email or why wasn't there a sign posted?!\n\nI then made my way to the back of the store near layaway, which also doubles as a Walmart .com pick-up counter. There were only 2 people in front of me but I waited another 20-30 min there before it was my turn because there was only 1 associate at the counter. When I got up to the counter, the associate left for a while with no explanation while I stood there for about 5 min wondering whether anyone was going to return to assist me. When the associate finally returned and looked up my order, she shouted to another person to grab my order for her so that she could run to the bathroom. Talk about customer service...what a hassle to shop at Walmart!"
3,"I've had my eye on Samosa Factory for some time, but finally got around to trying it last night when our first choice for dinner was closed for the holiday. \n\nWe entered the small dining area and were greeted by the incredibly friendly server. We told him we wanted to order our food to-go and he still offered us two glasses of water and a starter to nibble on while we perused the menu. We settled on the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Tikka Masala. We also ordered some garlic naan. Our server was incredibly personable and offered us refills on our water while we waited as well as made some idle chit chat with us. \n\nOnce our food arrived, we paid our bill and off we went with our food. The server also offered us a to-go menu for our return visit. Great customer service!\n\nMy fella and I dug into our meal as soon as we got home. The spice level was just right. We ordered the medium spice level to be on the safe side on our first visit. The garlic naan was delicious and I really enjoyed the rice. The flavors were right on and I look forward to a return visit to hopefully eat in the restaurant and try some of their samosas. The food is not cheap, but I didn't feel it was overly expensive for the quantity and quality of food we got.\n\nDefinitely a great Indian option in a town that is lacking."
4,"After having our venue near our home cancel on us last minute due to structural issues, I felt panicked. We called multiple places in San Diego that were all booked or couldn't accommodate a last minute request. We came to Vegas after finding this place online. \nWe had our wedding here in Feb of 2013. It was absolutely perfect! The center pieces, lighting, food, atmosphere, etc was all exceptional. They were accommodating to requests and last minute changes! Everyone I met who worked here was nice and caring. You didn't feel like you were in Vegas. I think you get more than you pay for here. I would highly recommend this place."
0,"Nothing new at this place, they continue to remove the expiration dates\noff their food products. Someone needs to alert the clark county health department!!!"
0,"This place has thousands of albums in varying condition. It has a great selection of multiple genres of music. There are some rarities and very valuable collectibles. But the previous reviews are true: nothing has a price written on it... and once the gentleman behind the counter quotes you prices on some vinyl, you will be rendered utterly speechless. Whether you are a newbie, a veteran collector or even a dealer, he's going for the jugular! He quoted me $150 -200 (each!) on records that are readily available at other shops around the U.S.  (or even ebay) for $25 max!  He wasn't rude or obnoxious; he was simply hopelessly and completely unrealistic. Maybe he thinks he can gut the tourists or un-knowing younger people trying to build a collection. Bottom line: use the web to validate LP pricing or you will likely be hammered. \n\nThey're his albums. He amassed them, so he can ask what he wants for them. If he has children, maybe they like records (they are going to inherit some). He surely won't be selling many at 600% mark up!"
0,I believe that the owner is Rick from my two phone calls with him I think it should be *rick. I asked what Sinatra box sets he had and reeled off the sets I was looking for and waited with baited breath all I got was a torrent off abuse and a hang up. As I was staying on the strip which I explained I did not want 2 needless taxi fares if the sets were not there or too expensive. Rick must struggle with the concept of customer service which in the USA I usually find to my liking he must be a lottery winner who does not need the money. If they could only relocate the shop to the Grand Canyon or under Lake Mead this would be a great help!!!!!!
0,"Ok, time to bring these reviews down to reality.\n\nNote: I am not an Hawaiian food expert so if you are, take that into consideration.\n\nThis Resturant has Kitchen nightmare written all over it.  The Resturant itself is in TOTAL disrepair.  Lights and air conditioning don't work, the carpet is filthy, the tables are scattered with outdoor lawn chairs, cables hang from the ceiling, decor is beyond decayed.\n\nFOOD: based on reviews here, I had the Hawaiian plate.  The pork had over 1 pound of pure fat in it.   Maybe that's the Hawaiian way, but for me it looked totally disgusting.   My wife had the teriyaki bowl.  Parts of it were burnt and afterwards she was complaining her stomach hurt.  Rice was ok.\n\nDETAILS\nResturant:  1/10 (this ain't homey -- it's rundown)\nAmbiance:  1/10 (scary!)\nService: 5/10 (a little slow but friendly)\nCleanliness: 1/10 (board of health should be concerned.)\nFood: 1/10 (we were trying to determine what was editable. Not good.)\nRestroom: don't know.  I was too scared to go in.\nParking: 4/10 (small lot)\n\nOverall quality seemed to be totally lacking."
2,"My nails were chipping from too much dice throwing during the week, and since vegas sucks up my money all the time, I was looking for a quick and cheap manicure to do some repair before I headed back. This was the first place that popped up on yelp, and I headed over for the reviewed $10 manicure. \n\nFirst of all, the price was raised to $12 for a manicure now. Secondly, I feel like non-manhattan salons do not carry Essie. I've only visited 2 so far, but nobody has Essie which is my go to. I'm ok with OPI, which is a staple but its sad that they didn't have essie. \n\nThe lady that worked on my manicure was fine. She used a buffering machine thing, which is new for me. I've never had that type of treatment before. The manicure was fine, my nails lasted about a week or 1.5 weeks. \n\nThe establishment itself didn't feel very chic or anything, but its fine for a quick manicure. It's a nail salon and a hair salon together. Most of the workers are vietnamese, and theres one haircutting lady that's chinese. They're not too chatty which is what I like; I tend to zone out when I'm getting a manicure. and they're friendly and nice. It's located in the middle of a small shopping plaza near this large asian super market, which was convenient. \n\nI recommend this place if you're visiting vegas and you need a quick fix."
0,Unbelievable. How the heck do you run out of crushed peppers and parmesan cheese?\n\nI should've run back in and grabbed a whole roll of those Bounty-like paper towels. Would've served them right.
0,"Horrible service. I ordered breadsticks, just breadsticks. It took 45 MINUTES! And the cook was eating while she cooked. Not secret snacking, she was chomping away at the food she was making!!  \nI was not asked size options, is there only one size? My sticks cost $4.50, which I thought was steep, and after, yes after I had already paid, and been given my change,.. she said \""it's going to be 15-20 minutes, is that ok?\"" Well considering you've already taken my money do I have a choice? SO I said yes and waited, tried my damnedest to be patient, when 40 minutes rolled around there was 5 of us standing at the counter saying \""come on, this is ridiculous\"". Because it was!! \n\nPizza Hut was a childhood favorite. I hadn't been to a Pizza Hut in YEARS, and I will NOT be going back :("
0,"Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?"
3,"Yummy and cheap, cheap, cheap. \nThe boy and I were looking for a place to stop at on our way home from Chinese New Year, and decided to stop here, never having tried a hawaiian place before.. Which aparently, is an awful lot like Japanese? I guess? But with pineapples?\nAnyways, the boy got a teriyaki chicken bowl for under $4, and I got the garlic chicken with gravy for $7. Mine came with macaroni salad, which was meh. No real flavor at all to it. I'd probably just skip that part next time. But the garlic chicken was sooo so good, and the portion size was massive, 3 pieces of chicken and two rice scoops. I had to take half home. \nThe boy liked his teriyaki chicken bowl as well. Not as much food as the garlic chicken, but still more than enough. The teriyaki sauce had a nice pineapple tang to it, and the chicken was super tender."
1,"I ordered the \""grilled\"" mahi-mahi plate and ended up receiving a mahi-mahi omelette. I politely went to the counter to clarify my order, but the employee, a young kid, claimed the mahi-mahi plate is cooked with egg. If that is the case, then the menu should clearly state that. Not grilled. I didn't want to argue simply because I was wary of having something done to my reorder, didn't want to waste food, and was already starving. On top of that, the mahi-mahi omelettes were extremely bland (along with the side of mac salad) that I needed to add a lot of Aloha soy sauce which was probably the only best thing about my meal."
0,So unprofessional. Lady that I've never seen there before was talking about her personal business like she was at home. She was venting about something to the others. Her face was ticked off. Keep your personal issues at home and serve your customers!
2,"This was decent comfort food from back home.  Not worth a special trip but, if you're in the area, it is pretty good."
0,"The WORST customer service EVER! and here is why...\n\n1) I was at Aloha kitchen with my friends, and was trying to pay for my own entree.  Their fugly manager was asking me to pay for EVERYONE! and of course I said no.  Why would I? I am not Santa Claus and It's not even Christmas yet.  \n2) After I told her no I can't due to my financial hardship, she asked me to sell my bag that I was carrying with me.  (YOU DON'T FXXXING ASK YOUR CUSTOMER TO SELL THEIR BAG TO PAY FOR YOUR CHICKEN)\n3) Then, in front of my boyfriend and everyone, that fugly manager asked me to switch a boyfriend that would pay for everyone, and laughed.  (I WAS LIKE, \""WHY DON'T YOU JUST SERVE YOUR FOOD FOR FREE THEN, BITCH!) \n4) I told one of the guys that I will treat him a nice dinner next month because I am financially struggling these days.  And she told my friend to hang up on me if I ever call! (WHAT A BITCH!)\n\nI have never written a review before and I never thought I would ever write a review as horrible as this one.  BUT what I am writing here is the truth, and the truth is powerful.  The personality of the  manager at ALOHA KITCHEN is as hideous as her appearance.  Even though I was extremely disappointed and angered by her HORRIBLE service, now I pity her because she is just OH SO!! hideous inside and out.  \n\nSO!!! whenever any of you (who are reading this review) ever sees that fugly manager, you better be a BALLER and pay for EVERYONE you are with OR ELSE she will embarrass you to the MAX in front of everybody.\n\nGREAT JOB to the MANAGER at ALOHA KITCHEN! I will definitely spread the \""GOOD WORDS\""  :D"
2,"Was craving for a late Hawaiian meal with my coworkers and ventured  across town to find aloha kitchen. I had ordered the loco moco and I must say, it's not the best thing I ever had. The hamburger steak was so dry and lack any kind of flavor, the gravy was ok.  Would I come back? Sure, the prices were decent and might be worth trying again if I get one of those late night Hawaiian food cravings."
1,This Irish bar is pretty typical for a casino.  I.E. there isn't much Irish to it.  But it does have a decent selection of beers.  Sometimes they bring in very weird bands or groups to play music.  I would say it would be worth stopping by and grabbing a beer.  Plus you can keep the glass.
4,"I came here as a recommendation from a friend, because I was getting tired of the ridiculous prices the big companies like Firestone and Midas were trying to charge me for work done that usually required more work in the near future!\n\nThey have AMAZING service, it's owned by a Japanese couple, who are very friendly and accommodating. I've take my car here twice, the first was to take a look at the control arm bushings, ball barings, structs, and suspension. They told me all I need to do is replace the control arm bushings, which costed at a fraction of what Firestone quoted me!! \n\nSecond time, was a bit of an emergency, my window regulator snapped and the window dropped. This posed as a safety to my car so I brought it in the moment it happened, they took a look at it, told me what it was and gave me a quote. They told me they could do it that day and finish before the shop closed! Which was a saver because it was Friday and they close on the weekends!!\n\nThey also use genuine parts from whatever manufacture your car is from! Best thing to do is go in for an estimate and set up an appointment for later in the week if it's not urgent. \n\nThe gentlemen that works in the office along with the owner's wife was very helpful both times and remembered who I was, he also speaks multiple languages!"
0,They tryed to say my water pump was out when it was a fan relay that cost\n8$ \nSo getting a second opinion i saved hundreds\n\n\nThe guy lied and said they wont repair something i dont need \nI kinda believed him but i looked at my service records they did the timing belt and\nWater pump at 85000 miles \nReally disapointed then they said dont drive it \nOnce the relay was fixed the problem was gone\n\nParts quoted i needed\nWater pump\nThermostat\nlabor costs\nOver 500$ \n\nGet a second opinion esp if your visiting from california
4,"No Complaints with this place! Support the little guy, (last mom and pop shop)  and if you ever need anything repaired this is the place Vegas!"
2,"I have to say there customer service is great, however I frown upon the fact that they charge $115.00 right off the bat just to look at something that needs a repair which binds you to have the repair done there or you lose your money. I wouldnt mind paying that on a large repair but for a small repair like a broken stearing wheel lock, it can be very pricey. Not sure if I want to go back to have this done."
1,"I was really excited to go here since I've craved it for so long and because the last time I tried to go here ended up being a super fail attempt..\n\nSo why the two stars?\n\nService was WHACK. I know I'm not coming here to get fine dining service but damn, can a girl get some hot sauce and ketchup? My boyfriend and I came here and got 10pc bucket, some biscuits, and a side of coleslaw. When we had questions while ordering (prices, etc.), all the guy who took our order would do was point to the menu and shake his head. I swear, I did not hear his voice at all until he announced the total price. \n\nAlthough we got the order pretty quickly, NOT ONLY did they not ask us if we wanted the chicken original or spicy, they also didn't ask if we wanted condiments, napkins, or even a fork for the coleslaw! They might as well should've left out the top and straw for my drink too! It took us at least 15 minutes to get it. I think these problems could have easily been avoided if there were a station set up already with that stuff, but then again the place is also pretty small.\n\nIf those biscuits weren't ON POINT, I would've given this place 1 star. It made me so sad :("
1,"Another quick lunch led me to this place. I headed straight to the drive-thru and ordered their lunch special: 4 tacos, a drink, and fries for $4.99. They get points for being quick (only waited about 5 minutes) and friendly. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing about this place. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos. The tortillas were thick and gummy. The asada was dry and had little flavor. The al pastor was excessively greasy and the fries were forgettable. This might be good drunk food at 4 in the morning, but when you're sober... not so much."
1,"I have visited this place a few times now, a couple of times not so sober and I remember it was good then...\n\nMore recently I went back during lunch and the expeirence was not so stellar. The carne asada i got on my tacos had huge chucks of fat on them, I get trying to cut corners but if tacos jsut come with meat and tortilla make sure the meat is good. It was a bad experience, I guess I should go back to see if it was a fluke but don't really wanna watse a lunch when there are so many other good options out there. \n\nOnly good point it that it is cheap but you get what you pay for here, fat tacos not carne asada."
2,"Epoys offer a variety of food and snacks. food are always warm and tasty.\nHowever, this restaurant is no longer in business. a thai restaurant replaced it."
0,"i would love to give it zero stars if I could, (Yelp? maybe a feature you can implement??) anyway, bottom line I WISH i'd stopped by here and read the reviews before plunking down $26 on 2 lunches we could never get back!!\nfood is disgusting, bland, tasteless, hopeless, worse than mediocre, and I could go on and on.\nthere were total of 5 dishes, and rest of the lunch buffet was filled with lettuce, onions, chutneys, yogurt dips with no real veggies to actually dip in. the samosas were leaking of oil, pakoras were nasty didn't taste like pakora batter but stuffed with some dal of some sort to save money, the curries were GROSS ugh!!! and when u enter, u see all these awards plastered on the walls??/ who is handing these out???\ndon't go here...its full of retards serving nasty food that'll make u barf whether u're hung over or not."
4,"I go here every week with my husband and a group of friends.  I've noticed there are some negative reviews on here, and that came as a big surprise to me.  My husband and I have had Indian food in many different states and even different countries around the world.  After traveling around the world to find the perfect curry, I can tell you that this is the best.  I have not had better Indian food.  Truly."
1,"I went here back in August over the summer and it was so so. I went with a male friend that's a local but never had been, so we go to check it out. $30 cover, not to happy about that but whatever, so we get in. Because of my club hopping and drinking prior to come here I had to use the restroom, I hate using public restrooms or any that isn't my own toilet for that matter, so I go looking for the restroom to find its in the strippers dressing room. I see all these naked  girls changing, primping or whatever. The smell in this dressing room almost knocked me out. I'm a female, so I know how we should and should not smell, I'll leave it at that. I think they needed to bomb it with some FDS STAT!!! I hopped out of there fast quick and  in a hurry. I come back to sit finding my boy watching this stripper dance for him, and he has this perplexed look on his face. I ask \"" whats the matter with you?\"" He says \"" Her ass looks like she got hemorrhoids\"", says \"" come here and look\"" LOL  . I replied \""Hell No\"". I laughed so hard.  There was another dancer there who had guy friends act like they were random customers and making it rain all over her. My boy noticed it. I laughed at that too.  There was one girl that seem to be capable of doing the job. She was active, she actually could work the pole, and do some tricks too.  So all in all I can't be to mad about it. It was whatever, but funny as hell in the same token."
4,"First Vegas Strip Club experience. Little Darlings was an amazing experience lol. Hottest chicks, all nude, best overall value compared to other Strip clubs in Vegas which are topless only and super expensive. Went on a Tuesday, and it was awesome, plenty of girls, good atmosphere. They say the lap dances are two for one on Tuesday but it seems all the strippers had their own price, some say $20 for a lap dance others $40. Either way, great experience, fine girls for sure. Will go again next time I'm in Vegas. The only complaint is the cover which is $30 for visitors, and if you get money out of the ATM there it's a $10 fee which is insane so bring plenty of cash."
1,"Little Darlings is 100% nude, hence. no alcohol was served.  It's a little off the Vegas strip but not hard to find.  If you want an awesome VEGAS strip club experience, this is not the place.  It was dingy and cheap looking.  I felt kind of dirty stepping inside.  The girls were not in their perfect form.  Some of them were old and out of shape (to put it nicely).  If that's what I wanted to look at, I could have stayed home and looked in the mirror.  We were club hopping so this was just another place for us to check out.  We only stayed less than 1 hour and skipped to Cheetah's afterward.  I would say to skip it totally."
0,"I have came to Little Darlings 4 different occasions and every time I was dissatisfied. I love entertainers and the technically of dancing. Yet, this is NOT the place to enjoy it. \nCover for locals is $17 and $33 for outsiders, includes soda beverages at the bar. I have attended by myself AND with friends. We all agreed that the size of the venue was great but the atmosphere depressing. The entire night seemed unorganized. The dancers walk/stand around with scrunched mean faces and uncomfortable body language. I noticed they only smile when approaching a customer to converse. That being said 3 out of the 4 times i attended, I was never approached. Little do the women know I have $200+ for someone with good conversation and a nice smile. Oh well. \n\nI think the top 2 buzz killers for me was the DJ and the Dancers. The music ranges from rock n' roll, 80s, to hip hop. I love the variety but the transitions are horrible and the in between songs are almost annoying. The DJ's voice sounds like he is at an auction and you can never hear what he is saying 90% of the time. I am a firm believer that the DJ controls the hype and atmosphere of a club. And unfortunately I was very bored and distant.\nThe dancers are average when it comes to the skill level. They know maybe 1 or 2 pole tricks then attempt to shake their butt to their chosen tune. The majority of the dancers are beautiful in their own way.Eh, I'd say there's only 1 woman that I enjoyed watching. Jackie was here name. She was smiling and flirting and used the entire stage during her performance! She made me smile and had my eyes locked. I moved closer and threw her a big tip, she came over and thanked me. Her breast were so soft ^_^} After her performance she came over to my chair and thanked me again. I tipped her a $20 bill then released her to make more money. Its very difficult to watch the other dancers on stage without my face being twisted. They are not entertaining nor look like they enjoy their job. Smh. I can't bare to return.\n\nI would recommend going to Lacey's. Full Nude Full Bar Strip club. Thursdays 9pm-4am Fridays-Saturdays 3am-7am This is the Hip Hop strip club of Las Vegas. 21+ $20 cover charge for all. IF YOU WANT AN ENTERTAINING STRIP CLUB WITH DRINKS, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND GREAT MUSIC THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD BE!! Not Little Darlings"
1,"Time of visit: Thursday afternoon\n\nPros: \n1. totally naked females, \n2 some of the females were very attractive and young, \n3. some of the females were very accomodating\n4. okay layout and moderate space\n\nCons:\n1. totally naked females -- some of you may  not want an ugly girls snatch 2inches from your face\n2.some of the females were very unattractive --- they weren't little...nor darling...more like...big.& gnarling...i.e.. (strectch marks..etc)\n3. some of the females were very un-acccomodating (case in point -- blue light special, 2 for 1 dance.....many of the more attractive strippers outright rejected that coupon/discount...one even tried to charge twice as much for 1...WOW....\n4. layout -- unfortunatlly..no beer/acohal\n\noverall, the cons outweighs the negative as of my recent visit.....perhaps management will read this and make corrective action to persuade the better looking strippers to honor the blue light special......if not...then its basically a bait and switch......."
2,Great place for lunch little slow on the service side but the food is consistent quality and very good. Crunch roll and the mackerel were my favorite the seaweed salad is good too but you can't mess that one up. The box meals are pretty standard. \nThe sashimi is good quality and good size portions the best was the salmon hand roll
2,small limited very reasonably priced friendly employees unique speciality items but not intended for your complete shopping needs this location is steady busy with lots of parking

Not me!!\n\nTrader Joes pre-made lunches are pretty great (the ones in the deli area are the ones I am taking about)... also the cranberry sauce that they carry seasonally doesn't have fructose corn syrup or aspartame in it like everyone else's! Last but not least if you like buying cleaning products that aren't tested on animals- the sage oil and water spray \""next to godliness\"" is the bomb! It works wonders, smells good, and wasn't tested on animals- oh and cheap!!"
3,"This aint your basic grocery store. Actually, to tell you the truth, I did not really start coming here until this cookie butter craze took off. \n\nThis last visit, I was actually there to get some Mac n Cheese in the frozen food section because I have had some at somebody's house before and it was just brought up in a recent conversation (Yelp Talk strikes again!). \n\nIronically, there just happen to be some Speculoos Cookie Butter available on the shelf. Since I already had the regular cookie butter at home, I got the Cocoa Swirl this time. I was a bit surprised that there was any Speculoos at all since people pretty much grab all of them as soon as the store opens up.\n\nIf you are not in a rush, I recommend you take your time shopping here because not only will you discover new things, you will also learn that the employees here are very helpful in anything that you might be looking for.\n\nBesides your basic grocery items, you will find that TJ's carries other things that even the major grocery stores don't carry. These guys might not be the biggest stores, but they house a lot of goodies that people come here specifically for. Things like various nuts, vegetables, spices, pickled items, chips, etc. \n\nSo get on up and check this place out any time you pass by one or are in the area. Stock up on some goodies!\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #41"
4,Much better than ANY casino. Great food and service. The menu is fantastic. Breakfast and lunch.   Look for it just west across from Palace Station.
2,"I was attending a convention and the room was was affordable. I stayed in the courtyard and although the rooms are not up-to-date like the Tower Rooms. It was cozy, comfortable, and clean. We were close to the gym and the pool. Nothing luxurious but suit it's purpose. I did get to see the Tower Rooms and they are up to date and not that much more than the courtyard rooms. \n\nWe also ate at the buffet and the food was good and they had a variety of food available including seafood, salads, prime rib (very good), mexican, Italian, etc... The cost of the buffet was affordable except for Friday night, but it was Seafood Night. \n\nWe had breakfast at Coco's Bakery, conveniently located in the casino. The breakfast was very good (Breakfast Special included: pancakes, sausage or bacon, hash browns or hash rounds, and eggs $3.99) and prices were affordable. \n\nThe location was good on the other side of the strip, we were able to get there in 5 min. (just had to find parking). \n\nSo, if you are going to Las Vegas and need an affordable place to stay, the Palace Casino suits the bill."
0,We were given a room at the courtyard section.  Big mistake I guess the amount you pay for is what you get.  My family and I experieced bug bites for the past two nights. Noticed one bite the first night but on the second night we all noticed more bites on are face and body.  Informed the front desk and this had to be reported to security.  They took along time. Would not stay there again.
2,"Probably the most basic of all the Station properties with the Oyster Bar being the best reason to come here. The steak restaurant is a pretty decent deal for lunch too. Cheap rooms, gambling, buffet, drinks etc. \n\nI dislike the fluorescent lighting in the poker room. It makes me feel like I am in a high school biology class. I do like the sports bettors parking spots which gives action junkies a close place to park to put in their bets.\n\nThis isn't a bad place if you're on a budget and have a vehicle but I would still opt for Fremont St if I were here on an el cheapo trip to LV."
2,nice place not the best but def not the worst
2,"Best way to describe this place- you get what you pay for. It wasn't a super classy or fancy joint, but it was a decent, cheap place to crash.  Can't complain too much about it.  The service was good, my room and bathroom were clean, and there was shuttling to and from the strip (if you don't mind walking a bit of distance... it only goes to the mall on the Stratosphere end of the strip) and to and from the airport. All my needs were met, thus I was content. Overall, decent hotel at a very good price (especially for such an expensive place like Vegas)."
3,"Warning:  No resort can be all things to all people and The Palace Station is NOT a good choice for many of the whiners and cry babies who post here. \n\nWe stayed in a double/double in the Courtyard for only $34.00 per night, including the resort fee which is an incredible bargain. The beds and the room were fine--no tub, but a shower large enough for two.  While the carpet in the hallway was somewhat aged, the room was only steps from the parking lot, which is rare in Las Vegas.  \n\nThe food choices were excellent, and having grown up by the Chesapeake Bay, I found their Raw Bar to be among the best I have ever visited.  The Feast Buffet was great and at $7.99pp it was as good or better than most others at two or three times the cost.   Our favorite was the Grand Cafe with its $4.99 Las Vegas Shrimp Coctail which came with 30+ smallish but delicious shrimp.  The Cafe has a number of inexpensive, but delicious entrees, and has a great breakfast.  We were very sad to find The Broiler was closed:(\n\nThe Gaming is superb, and the slots offer better odds than any of the \""Strip\"" casinos.  We found the staff and servers very helpful, quickly fixing a glitch in the Wireless Internet. Even the dealers were friendly. The Palace Station reminds one of a bygone era where one got an excellent product at an affordable price."
1,"ONLY reason why I'm here, two words OYSTER BAR. \n\nI know my friend LOVES this spot - oyster bar. cheap tables. comp'ed rooms galore. But the thing is, the casino is dingy, old, and ciggie filled I think even if they re-did the entire place it would still reek of old ciggie smells. \n\nThe rooms are tidy, neat, and clean. Yes the tables are hellva cheap and you can take turns gambling, as you're waiting in the never ending line. But it's really what you get what you pay for.\n\nThis place is off strip, on the other side of the 15 off Sahara. Close to the Asian food areas though! No need to pay for valet - their parking is right in the front of the casino/check in area."
0,"Staying in the section of the hotel that's considered the courtyard completely nasty and awful.  The smell, look, everything else made Vegas a bad experience to start but we quickly check out and paid 50 dollars a night more and stayed at the Hard Rock Casino & Hotel."
1,"If you stay here get a tower room. They are reasonably priced and fairly modern. All the other rooms are a glorified version of \""pay by the hour\"" rooms. They're dated and they stink. The sportsbook is more like a sportsbook museum. They actually still write the odds on a white board. How quaint, or sad, depending on how you look at it. Go there after 3 am and you will see the shift change strippers piling in to throw away their \""hard earned money\"". The oyster bar used to be hidden gem but now its a victim of it's own success. Long lines for food that no longer hits the mark. They must advertise in Orange County, CA because the oyster bar is always packed with asians from OC. More proof that nothing good in Vegas lasts. As far as the casino goes, its smoky and relatively low class. That begger at the corner of Sahara and the Strip you gave 50 cents to? Well, you just might meet up with them at the blackjack tables. Enjoy"
0,"Waited 40 minutes in line at the cage on a Sunday morning. There wasn't even a lot of people in line, just really slow processing. There was a gambling addiction brochure on the counter that said \""the fun stops here\"" - oh you bet the fun stopped after waiting that long!"
3,"So I am totally shocked by the poor reviews of this place.\n\nTo the people surprised by the amenity fee..  It is disclosed and that is on you for not paying attention when you booked.  (It is also waived when the rooms are comped.)\n\nTo the guy all upset because his children couldn't hang with him in line for the Oyster Bar and thought they should \""look the other way\"":  Do you know the casino is subject to an enormous fine for that?  Sorry it wasn't family friendly.   It's called a casino.\n\nThe Courtyard rooms are grossness.  Tower rooms are nice.  The employees are fantastic.  (I always wonder if people that complain about the employees without a specific customer service issue are just rude.)\n\nThis is not a 5 Star property.  It is an off strip prop which caters to locals and has cheap n clean hotel rooms in the tower.  If you'd like to run around with small children or experience the Bellagio for $30 per night while staying in the cheapest rooms possible this is not a good option."
2,"Recently I visited the front bar closest to the sports book to have a beer and the senior hispanic bartender that was working was so busy chit chatting with his fellow hispanics, I think he forgot he was at work and not at the family quinceanera. After almost ten minutes of waiting for him to catch up with what you would have thought was his family he then acknowledges me an ask me what would I like to drink. After ten minutes of watching him chit chat about irrelevant things, I changed my mind and left the casino. What horrible service! This guy obviously needs to retire if he can no longer maneuver an do what he's getting paid to do. There was nothing speedy about this Gonzales."
1,the hotel isn't a looker but having the Oyster Bar and bingo here make it A-ok with me.
1,"So... After being excited about the decent room rate and booking the room, I came across a number of reviews that described horrible sounding conditions of the rooms, including a bed bug and roach infestation. I told my husband we were not going to even take our stuff or kids in the room until I did a thorough inspection. After quickly reading up on how to conduct a bed bug inspection (thanks Google), I checked the room thoroughly and was happy to find no signs of bed bugs or roaches. So we stayed. \n\nWould I stay again? No. After you walk through the large hotel that doesn't seem too bad, you walk back outside to the \""courtyard\"" rooms. Sounds nice, right? Nope. It feels like you're walking out of the real hotel and walking into the motel behind it. Rooms just seem very run down, a little dirty, carpets stained, etc. The beds seemed clean, which is what led us to stay, but I didn't want the kids to even take their socks off or play on the ground at all. Its a good backup, but we personally won't do it again."
3,"I like this place alot, its within walking distance from my house, loud and informal, authentic, and a blast.\n\nAnywhere you sit you are bombarded by noise, smells, glossy pictures of the food, and occassionally someone's sloppy elbow.  in a town of over inflated celebrity chef pet restaurants, a place like this fills the niche.  \n\nthe food is solid japanese counter fare, fresh seafood, great rolls, it comes out whenever.  the service is usually pretty quick and they love giving out fresh beers.  plus they serve pork belly which is a huge plus in my book.\n\ndefinately hit the spider roll, the yellowfin tartare, the pork belly and napa stir fry, and the HONEY TOAST!!..  where else can you get half a loaf of bread filled with icecream?"
2,"I really had high expectations for this place given how everyone before me raved about it. Plus I have been traveling to research dishes when I open my own izakaya restaurant. \n\nOf course, my friend and I come here after being at LAX, so we may have gotten in on the tail-end of it all. Overall, it was not bad. Seems like the type of place you go with friends to drink and be merry. Not the culinary adventure I was expecting."
2,"Not sure why it comes up as a sushi bar??? \nIts really not where I would come for sushi.\nBut....The Kushi Tan  is INCREDIBLE!!! \nAs for the Bacon wrapped Mochi I wish the bacon could have been cooked a little more the second time eating there.\nBut the Beef Carpaccio Deeeee-lish, oooh and the Garlic Bokchoy! \nand the Honey Toast Yummm I know from the pics on here it looks burnt but really it's not.\nPretty good place but you have to know where to find it too!"
3,"This rating is based on food more than service, which is fine, I'd rather have great food & so-so service\n\nIn town for yet another trade show, we ran from the strip & found this place (thanks yelpers!!)\nSmallish, cramped space, and packed! So we knew it must be good.\nThey fit us in with no res (on a Thursday), and the service was decent, not rude, but rushed & they got one thing wrong, but not major.\nThe menu is augmented with \""specials\"" on paper all over the walls. Helps if you speak Japanese I think (another good sign).\nSo we just kept ordering more after looking around, and everything was GOOD. \nThis is not your typical \""American\"" sushi joint with Calif roll/ spicy tuna roll. This is real Japanese food, some twists like Jalapeno friend rice, which we heard was good from the guy next to us.\nSo if you want GOOD, fresh, real food, this is the place.\nMaybe make a res!\nAnd there's a bakery next door that has yummy dessert.\nGo across the street for a fab foot massage to end the evening."
2,"Mochi wrapped in bacon? Asparagus wrapped in bacon?! Salmon mozzarella tempura, oh my!\n\nThis place has a lot of food that boggles your mind. Be adventurous and order off the items on the wall. This is the kind of stuff you see on Iron Chef. BUT, execution of many the dishes are far from Iron Chef caliber.\n\nOur group ordered a lot and I still don't remember everything I ate.\n\n* Deep Fried Prawns - The prawns are not the jumbo shrimp that many people are use to, but the small size everyone refers to as shrimp. Even then it wasn't deep fried enough where you can eat the entire shrimp as a whole, which left a bitter a taste because you can still taste the shell. We had a couple of pieces left over, which is a sin for our group to waste seafood! I guess it was just that bad.\n\n* Eggplant - I don't like eggplant, this dish reinforces that idea. It just came out what look like something you serve prisoners. Regardless, tried it and it wasn't good. Everyone, except one person like the dish, explaining it could have been served warmer, instead of lukewarm.\n\n* Mochi wrapped in Bacon - Bacon has a very salty taste and mochi has a weaker sweet taste. Combine both, and you get bacon taste. Really thats all there is to this, sure you get the chewy mochi texture, but the bacon just overpowers it. I might as well get a bacon skewer wrapped in bacon.\n\n* Salmon Mozzarella Tempura - We ordered this at the beginning of the meal, but didn't get it till almost the end of our meal. Great combo, but poor execution. Mozzarella or any cheese for that matter should be really melted and served as hot as possible. Thats why nachos, pizza, and burgers all have melted cheese because it just tastes better! The mozzarella tempura came to us lukewarm and almost cold. Just properly heating up the mozzarella could have made this dish a winner, but just became another forgotten dish. \n\n* Oysters w/ garlic butter sauce - Oysters was good, but felt the garlic butter sauce drowned the flavors of oysters. Maybe a little bit less garlic and a more watered down butter sauce would do it. \n\n* Salmon something w/ Salmon Caviar - This is a zensai or Japanese hors d'oeuvres. I believe it was salmon, but I could be wrong.  The caviar (fish eggs), just overpowered the rest of the zensai. Get the tar tar yellow tail instead.\n\n* Pork w/ eggs and ?? - I forgot what this was exactly, but the first time we ordered it, our pork was tough and dry. But ordering it for round 2 there is a world of difference. This bothers me a little when they can't deliver food consistently good.\n\n* Pork steaks with onions - The opposite happen with this one, it was good the first time we got it, and not so good the second time. First time it was cooked properly preserving the juices of the pork, but second time resulted in a more dry pork steak that didn't really have much flavor.\n\n* Wasabi Squid / Octupus - I don't like squid and octupus, but did give this a try. It was supringsly very refreshing. I thought I would get the kick from the wasabi, but I got a refreshing cool taste instead. I still wouldn't eat it again, but I'm sure those who love squid or octupus will love this dish.\n\n* Gyoza - Served hot for us. Very tasty and delicious. \n\n* Artichoke or Asparagus wrapped in Bacon - Wrap anything in bacon, and it'll probably taste good. This waste the case. Look mom, I'm eating my veggies... wrapped in BACON! \n\n* Beef Liver with bean sprouts and green onion - I don't really like eating liver, but this was one of the dishes that was executed very well.   It was very tender all the way through, and the bean sprouts and green onion just help balance the flavors of the liver.\n\n* Beef Carpaccio - Clean refreshing taste, that does a good job of balancing the strong beef flavors.\n\n* Black cod - Very flavorful and just cooked properly all the way through. This was reminiscent of the awesome sea bass at HK star.\n\n* Tar Tar Yellow Tail - Its just so hard for me to describe this, just order it, its good! You get 4 of them per order.\n\n* Honey Toast w/ Ice Cream - 5 pieces of honey bread toasted together, and the center burrowed out to fit the Vanilla ice cream. Simple, but awesome. We originally were given plastic utensils trying to divide it in our group, but that failed. Another waitress saw this fail, and gave us some metal utensils to slay the honey toasted dragon. It would have been nice if the first waitress gave us metal utensils to begin with. \n\nPhew that was a long list, there was more but I really can't remember them all. The wait staff was very friendly and refilled our drinks in a timely manner without asking. Other than the mishap with the Salmon Mozzarella Tempura and the plastic utensils, no complaints. The back of the house could use some work though, needing to deliver food consistently good and refine some items.\n\nIchiza is a cool hangout to try Japanese Izakaya food, but there are a couple of land mines along the way as you try to find the gems. Don't get blown up!"
3,A friend recommended this place. Came here for dinner & it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be from reading all the other reviews. Friendly environment. The food was GOOD! I'd recommended getting the yellowtail tar tar mmm yummy to my tummy. Also had the scallop wrapped w salmon & it was actually ok. I didn't really care for the fried garlic. I'd come back to this place again when visiting vegas in the future.
3,"Konichiwa 702!!!\n\nJust came back from another fun weekend in Las Vegas.\nFlew in from LAX... and I was craving Japanese... thanks to YELP... I found Ichiza!\n\nI advise anyone in Las Vegas visiting or resident to stop by Ichiza to get your Japanese fix! Super cute spot with tons of things to choose from. Dinner here was a get find.\n\nI'm a fan of their miso soup, shrimp tempura...shrimp fried rice.\n\nCustomer service is standard... could have been better (my reason for my -1 star.) Our waiter was lagging through out our visit.\n\nBut the food is solid!\n\nIt looks like over the last couple of years, I've been posted in LV at least 3 times a year... so the next time I'm back... I'm going to get my ICHIZA fix!\n\nUpstairs at a random building. Free parking. Casual dining. Come by with friends and family!\n\nOishii!\n\nGotta love those hidden gems!\n\nArigato Ichiza!"
1,"We waited for 20 minutes to be seated.  I wish we had left.  \n\nMaybe we just didn't know what to order.  I was really overwhelmed by the menu.  I had expected it to be a traditional Japanese Sushi Restaurant offering traditional Sushi and such, but it's not.  \n\nI saw quite a few people ordered the Ichiza Ramen, so I decided to try it, too.  It was quite possibly the worst ramen I've ever had.  I don't know how to describe the flavor, or rather the lack of it.  I tried adding tons of chili powder and it just didn't work.  I barely finished 1/3 of it.  \n\nI also ordered some kind of diced tuna salad.  It came with a raw quail egg on top.  Probably my fault that I didn't read the menu carefully.  I don't eat raw egg of any kind!\n\nMy fiance's Pork Katsu was the only thing good.  It was small but I just had to steal a bite from him.  \n\nLastly was the famous Honey Toast.  One word - OVER-RATED!!!!  There was barely honey drizzled on the toast.  The ice cream was too too sweet.  If you like thick piece of toast with very sweet ice cream, this is for you.  \n\nI had such high hope for this place, but I left disappointed and hungry!"
0,"Dined at ichiza  4-5 x with a friend   late pm  after long day at   work and  one night- a  couple sitting next to our table - kid you not-  the man started putting  their dirty   plates on our table while we were eating!  I said excuse me but the rude  and uncivilized man just pretended we didnt exist and grumbled something to his wife in Korean. Immediately told manager  whats going on - but he just took plates off our table , apologized and left.  The food was okay- but i never went back after that experience"
3,"I finally decided to finish up my review for Ichiza.  My first trip consisted of trying the ramen.  Here's what I had written for that visit:\n\n\""The ramen at Ichiza isn't the best that I have had.  After visiting Monta so many times, I guess i was expecting something more flavorful.  The broth is pretty bland, although it is probably healthier than the Monta broth.  The veggies and meat were all fresh.  However, I like the noodles better at Monta as well.  This is more of an appetizer to share with friends rather than a main course meal.\""\n\nMy opinion changed after I went with a few friends, and we tried lots of stuff.  I didn't have time to record everything we ate, but I remember enjoying nearly all of it. We had a few rolls to start off with, california rolls, a sardine roll, etc.  These were pretty standard rolls, and very tasty.  We also tried a pork belly bowl, which we all thought was amazing!  It was so tender and had a perfect flavor.  The fried octopus was about the only octopus I have had that wasn't rubbery.  So many dishes, and all of them were great!  \n\nIf you haven't been to Ichiza, go with a group of friends that like to try different things, and give this place a try.  It is a local Japanese favorite, and for good reason!"
3,"We love Ichiza and go almost every time we're in Vegas.  We always order a ton of food.  Everything is always delicious, but I  love the chicken tatsuta-age and the kimchee fried rice.  It's always busy and there is often a wait, but it's definitely worth it."
2,"Yummy food for a great price,  but I wished the service was faster.  The wait for a table can be long,  and also to get the check.  Although the food was delish.  I recommend the grilled whole squid,  the grilled salmon collar, and for sure---the honey toast dessert  **a must try**"
3,"If I can take the chefs of Ichiza and open a new and bigger restaurant with trained servers, hostesses, etc... I would probably have one of the best Asian restaurants in all of Las Vegas. \n\nThe issue with Asian restaurants in general is the poor service. It can really put a damper in your dining experience. Instead of hiring experienced waitresses who can clearly understand what you're saying and be attentive throughout the meal, many Asian joints hire their nieces and/or other family members, or perhaps even random attractive Asian girls. \n\nLet's just say, Ichiza... you have phenomenal Japanese food. Authentic and not overpriced, with an extensive variety offered all over the walls and on the menu. Your ramen is definitely better than Monta's (at least that's my opinion). I will always crave your curry udon, pork and onion skewers, fresh oysters, and pretty much everything else offered in that tiny space of a restaurant ;)   But please, please, please work on the service aspect! \n\nOn the several occasions I've been to this restaurant, my group and I waited about 15+ min to be approached after seating. We watch hungry and thirsty as the 2 or 3 waitresses on duty walk by, bus tables, stare at other tables, giggle in the back, or just plain stand around. We usually have to flag someone down to inform her that we're ready to order and once we do, we feel rushed and it is rather difficult to communicate half the time. The food takes a little longer than the average Asian restaurant, which is ok... but once it's out, don't expect to see your waitress again. Or.. you will see her walking around, but she won't acknowledge your existence. Good luck on refills! \n\nLast night was a prime example. We had 4 of us in the group. We finally ordered our dishes, they came out after some time, then we had a 5th join us. Long story short, he did not have a chance to order anything at all, not even a glass of water. \n\nNeedless to say, this place has fabulous food, and it's adorable on the inside... very Japanese :). Workers are polite but lack any restaurant experience. I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars strictly due to service! I sure hope that aspect improves because then it would certainly be a 5 star experience all around!"
2,"This is one of those places where the food looks better than it taste.  It doesn't taste horrible, but definitely not as good as it looks.  \n\nMy favorites were the miso butterfish, kimchi fried rice and tuna sashimi salad.  It's a great place for you to try many different (small) appetizers at an efficient cost.  The vibe feels very Japanese, as if you really are in Japan, which was something I liked.  \nIt's a fun experience, but I didn't feel like it hit the spot when I walked out the door.  Probably won't come back to try different items, just my favorites."
4,"On the second floor of a strip mall off of Spring Mountain and Arville in the Chinatown area has a great Japanese restaurant called Icheza.\n\nThe restaurant is rarely slow.  That tells you that this place is doing something right!  Best time to avoid having to wait an hour or two is to come in right when they open at 4pm or really late night before they close.  On a Friday or Saturday night, even late night sometimes the place is crowded.  \n\nYou get a wide variety of people, a mix of young and old.  I have met poor college\nstudents to a CEO of a Japanese company eating at the Icheza sushi bar.\n\nThe prices are reasonable!  You can order many dishes for around $5.  Two people have a nice dinner for $40.\n\nMost of the staff are Japanese.  This helps give Icheza a unique feel of an actual Japanese restaurant in Japan.  To American standards, Icheza's dining area is small.  There is one \""sharing\"" table that seats up to 10 people, six tables for 4, two Japanese style tables where you take off your shoes that seat 8 and a sushi bar that seats 12.\n\nWith the limited seating, make sure to call in a reservation if you are planning on eating during prime time or take your chances.  Odds are, you will be waiting at least an hour.  The staff is friendly but busy.  Give Icheza a try!"
3,"I came here with one other person who turned out to be too afraid to try anything... So I didn't get to order much. This place is tapas style so it would have been better to come in a group and order a bunch of small plates everyone could share.\n\nI ordered fried baby octopus which was pretty tasty, and flying fish sashimi which was a special that night. The fish was interesting, but I think I prefer traditional sashimi after trying that.\n\nCool atmosphere, open really late, and seems pretty authentic. Just wish I could have tried more stuff."
2,"casual vegas dinner away in chinatown...upstairs plaza second floor...yakitori in izakaya fashion...beers, sake and shochu...japanese small plates dining...a pitcher of beer while browsing...standard skewers...beef tongue chewy, but not tough...hamachi kama juicy and meaty...large rolls fat for sharing...average in presentation, quality and taste...another pitcher of beer washing...wings, bacon wrapped mochi, agadashi tofu and additional skewers...standard izakaya selection...nothing memorable in presentation or taste, but cheap!...finish and back to the strip!"
3,"A part of me has an irrational distaste for Ichiza. Maybe it is the fact that they can only seat 60 people and it causes a bottleneck at the front door. The wait times can be unreasonable, but that does not detract from the food. \n\nIt has been almost three years since I have last had a chance to eat at Ichiza. Yet again, we came to see that they had almost been filled to capacity. 10 minutes later we were sat. Count it as a blessing if that is all you have to wait. The seats at the bar is perfect for two and would make for a great date spot. Although you might be inches away from the next patron, everyone is more wrapped up in their own conversation and lives. There is no need to feel self-conscious. \n\nThe buta-kimchi is similar to a spicy pork dish popular in Korea. Mixed with kimchi and served on a bed of finely shredded cabbage made for a light dish. The garlic chicken gizzard is so simple and that makes it that much better. Add a squeeze of lemon and you will roll up the lettuce garnish to eat it all. Check the specials board and print out because hidden gems are bound to make an appearance. Yesterday, they had a blue fin tuna mix with micro greens on top of half an avocado. DECADENCE! They were not done yet. Add a quail egg to it and call it a day. Don't forget to save room for dessert, because everyone needs a little honey toast in their lives. So many places try to make a name for themselves off this dish, but not many can match Ichiza. I am not a huge bread person; but butter it up, douse it in honey, and top it with ice cream and even I cannot say no."
3,"Legit Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas? Check! \n\nThey only serve small size dishes here. So you order a lot and share.\n\nTuna Sashimi Tofu Salad: I dont usually eat sashimi because I can't get passed the texture. But I decided to try it here. And it was soooo goooddd. Maybe cause it was chopped up. Maybe cause it was sooo freshh. Either way, I was thinking..\"" Where has this been all my life!!??\"" Favorite dish of the day.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#j3Vy1CPwzDo_5UWFrnkKQg\n\nSpider Roll: Portions was kinda small for a spider roll.

It was super tender and just melted in your mouth! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA\n\nAll I have to say is, its a little pricey for what they give. But the food is definitely fresh because you get to see all the chefs make the food for you in the kitchen."
2,"Ichiza, I wanted to love you, but you just fell a bit short.\n\nI consider agedashi tofu a benchmark dish - if the batter is filmy and stretchy, it's not quite right to me, and if the broth is overly sweet, that's a huge red flag. The batter here was stretchy, and the broth was sweet. So that was already one strike.\n\nI also didn't like any of the raw dishes here, though true izakaya restaurants don't focus as much on that, so it wasn't a huge letdown for me.\n\nThe yakitori was inconsistent. My favorite is usually kawa, but the one here didn't have the char that you need for that one to be truly delicious. The tsukune and okura were good, but the gyutan was rubbery, a big no-no for me.\n\nYellowtail collar tasted good, as did the uni (the only raw seafood dish that worked), though there was a bit of a funky aftertaste with one of the pieces of uni that we got. \n\nService was good, if a little indifferent. Good prices for Vegas, or I'd have given this even lower ratings."
3,"Where have you been all my life, Ichiza?\n\nSushi, Ramen, and anything else Japanese? In one little space? \n\nI was intimidated by the wait at first, but what started as an hour wait ended up being only 25 minutes when several other parties cancelled. And thankfully, this appears to happen A LOT. But just remember, while it's not required, reservations do come highly suggested.\n\nAs a party of four, we all went in on the menu! One friend got sushi, another got mackerel, I got Japanese-style chow mein and gyoza and the fourth friend got something that begins with \""oppa\"" (not sure how it's spelled). It's all perfect for sharing. I liked everything except the mackerel (and I don't like mackerel in the first place so the restaurant is at no fault for that).\n\nEverything on the menu is really cheap by itself, but be mindful that everything does add up really quickly. We were quite surprised by our bill at the end of the meal.\n\nOh and did I mention I loved the ambiance? Between the low tables, the backless chairs, the small space with warehouse lighting, the large crowds and the Japanese written all over the walls, I really did feel like I had just been transported to Tokyo, and not just an Asian-themed strip mall in Las Vegas.\n\nPros:\nThe ambiance\nMenu has loads of variety and very reasonable prices\nFrequent and friendly service who won't get annoyed if you add more and more to your plate\n\nCons:\nSmall space leading to (possible) long waiting times to be seated and served\nWhile each individual item is inexpensive, it can all add up really quickly if you're not paying attention\n\nReturn Factor: I'd love to"
1,"Food was decent, but the manager on duty was super shady. First, no service, we didn't get napkins or water until 20 mins later when we asked for it. At the end, I paid with cash, and waited for change, but there was less $10 bill when the manager gave us the change. When we confronted him about it, he said there might've been a mistake and he corrected it. This is just not right, some shady things going on! It is unacceptable for a restaurant to not give the right amount of change, and it seems like this manager was trying to do it on purpose!"
3,"Ichiza is always a great late-night spot to fill your cravings or to just hang out after work with a beer and some skewers. Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks that. As a result, Ichiza is always packed, especially in the later hours. Sometimes you won't have to wait or may have a short 5-10 minute wait if you're eating alone or in a party of two (that way you can sit at the bar) but if you require a table, the wait is usually at least 30 minutes or even more. Of course, their earlier hours are less crowded, but many of the menu items (such as skewers) are not available.\n\nIchiza has been around for years and they remain pretty consistent in terms of food and service. A few times, however, my orders were forgotten or took a ridiculously long time to arrive. It can get very busy with only a few waitresses so I can see why mistakes happen.\n\nThe vibe is very authentic and is a local hotspot. There are item names posted all over the walls in both Japanese and English and sometimes you just have to wing it and see what arrives at your table. My favorites are the beef tataki, skewers (chicken gizzard and liver), grilled squid, and the tuna and tofu salad. The beef bowl is also a nice and filling item if you're hungrier. There is always hot green tea, which I love, and sometimes a little mini appetizer depending on the day and what they have.\n\nThere are so many menu items to be had so you really just have to try it yourself. It's a fun and casual dining experience with guaranteed good food that has created so many regulars over the years, myself included."
1,"Oh man so I know everyone just loves this place. \n\nWell I have been here a couple of times and usually go for the beef bowls. \n\n\nSo this time around, we decided to get more of their specialty stuff. \n\nSo we got lots of different things the pork and onions skewers, beef tongue skewers, buttered clams, hamachi sashimi, beef carpaccio, miso cod, salmon Kama. \n\n\nThe skewers were ok not as good as kyaras but ok. The clams were ok as well but a little too salty to my liking. Hamachi sashimi was good. The beef carpaccio was too oily. Miso cod was such a disappointment it was mushy very salty and just lacked the sweet flavor you usually get at other places. The salmon Kama was also salty and didn't seem cooked right.\n\nSurprisingly compared to other reviews I actually thought the service was great. They very attentive \n\nSorry maybe we went on an off night"
4,Bomb ramen. All the other food is delicious. Always worth the wait. They can always do most specials any day. Love the atmosphere and service. Never have been let down by this place.
2,"I believed the hype and made my family come here - twice - just to make sure I liked it or not. I will say that the food is good, but I wouldn't say it was so good it was totally worth the crowds. I'm always on the lookout for places that can rival all my favorites on both coasts, but this place is probably only a 3.6 for me personally. However, if you do decide to face the crowds, please do have the coffee jello and honey toast - both are delicious (Because always dessert...)!"

3,"The employees and owner here are very skilled at what they do. Santiago is the best man to do tint, and the sales reps will do anything that can to help you with you custom auto needs. I do recommend!"
0,"This sucks. I am still sitting inside Villa Pizza at a dirty table waiting for my chicken wings and fries. It has now been over 40 minutes that I've been waiting and no food in sight. Plus this place is freezing.  It is 46 degrees outside and not much warmer inside, and I am sitting as far as possible from the front door. This is my first horrible restaurant experience and I'm glad I have my iPhone to draft this review. \n\nNever again!"
0,**I'm not eating at a place where they don't practice basic food handling practice.** I paid cash for a lunch special the same person who took my money then started preparing my pizza with out washing his hands. I then asked him why didn't wash his hands first after handling money. He rolled his eyes didn't answer me and left to back. When he finally returned I asked for my money back and I left this place. Feeling bad for the people enjoying there lunch.
3,"Great place for an snack, appetizer, or meal. Perfect if you aren't sure what else is going to be open on Christmas day and you need something to tide you over since you have to wait 2 hours to be seated at Sam Woo/ or Dim Sum. \n\nPork Buns - were a good size at $1.30 a piece, coming fresh out of the oven at 11:30 am.\nChicken Pot Pies - Not really worth it unless you are craving the           great American spin- off.\nShredded Beef w/ Green Onion Roll - Only good because rolls last through the night perfect for hangover snacks. (costs more than the pork bun).\n\nHoney, I want to see your Pork Buns in Vegas, baby Vegas."
4,"I'm biased for this place. Trash talk this Chinese bakery to me and I will cut you. I love their coconut butterfly rolls, and the raisin stick is my BFF. my brother orders the bbq steamed buns, and bbq pork buns off the shelf. My mom likes her custard stick, and my sister just eats whatever's leftover in the 40.00 bag of goodies we bring home every time we make the trek to Chinatown. \n\nI love you, diamond bakery... marry me?"
3,The raisin bread and taro pastry were both very very tasty.
1,Disappointing Chinese bakery. The baked goods are freshly baked right out of the oven but don't taste that great. The bread was tough and other items did not look too appetizing; like the cracked egg tarts. The ladies behind the counter could care less about their customers. They just chatter away without paying any attention to you.  It's much better in SF.
2,"I came in hoping some egg tarts might be there, but of course that is always out first. The BF and I just grabbed some snacks for later.\n\nThe loot:\n\nGreen onion roll with pork sung- this was okay. The bread and sung was good, but I can barely get the green onion flavor. Thats really what I love normally about this is that strong flavor blend of the sweet bread, salty pork and savory onions....but it was missing part of the trifecta. \n\nSteamed Chicken Bun- pretty good. I would get it again if I'm in the area, but I would say it's pretty standard. It's just as good as the ones I got at the deli in the supermarket (168 has them in 4 packs). \n\nGreen Tea bread- the bread was good and the flavor seemed good but the swirls of green tea paste in the bread was really goopy, slimy almost so I didn't enjoy much of it. \n\nBF got pineapple bun and he ate it up so it must have been good. Honey crisps- still have it left over...a bit too oily. \n\nThe skinny is that this place is A-OK. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I'll come back for certain items when I'm in the area and to try to get some of these egg tarts."
1,"I judge Asian bakeries on their Pineapple Bun. And Diamond Bakery doesn't add up to buns I've had in LA (unfair comparison, I know) or even to buns you can find at 168 Market. I tried a while host of other buns and pastries, but The only thing I've had here that I enjoyed are the Steamed Pork Bun. Get them while they're hot, though."
2,"The Skinny: great when you get here around 10:20 am when stuff is fresh from the oven... otherwise you might have a lot less things to choose from (3.75), service: good - if you don't see something, ask the ladies and they'll find it for you in the back (3), value: pricey but will satisfy your Asian bakery fix (3)\n\nThe first couple of times I came here, I wasn't really impressed. The counters were pretty bare in the afternoon and I walked out empty handed.\n\nThen, for whatever reason, we stopped by this place at 10:20 am. I was shocked. They had Portuguese Egg Tarts (a Macau specialty - egg tarts with a golden brown topping from the extra sugar), Curry beef puffs, butter pan loaves, Taiwanese type sammys, rice dumplings. It was like a completely different store.\n\nThe Portuguese Egg Tarts are okay. I find the filling to be nice, but there are problems with the pastry. Not quite the shortbread crust, it's kind of a hybrid of between the flaky and cookie crust.\n\nThe curry beef puff is good. The puff pastry is flaky and light while the curried beef is flavourful. The bbq pork puff pastry was ok due to the lackluster bbq pork filling.\n\nIf baked buns are your thing, there is a caveat. I would say that the bun is a little on the drier side - okay when fresh but isn't that good the next day. For the buns without filling (ie, pineapple buns), you might find yourself a little disappointed. That being said, if you are a filling kind of person, you'll love this bakery because of the copious amounts of filling in their red bean and lotus paste buns. \n\nThe steamed buns are great and hold up better (I've refrigerated them and resteamed them the next day and it's good.). Fav are the red bean steamed bun - lots of filling, nice lighter texture than what you normally see.\n\nI really love their butter pan loaf (I'm not talking about the butter pan buns... see the pic here because I have no idea what they really call it in English: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q ). I got addicted to this brioche-like bread in Hong Kong from their famous Maxim's bakery. Although Diamond's cannot compare to Maxim's, it still is pretty good. Buttery and lighter than their regular bread, it iswonderful toasted with a little butter/jam.\n\nWith some great things items, this is my \""go to\"" place when I've a hankering for some Chinese bakery if I can get here when the bread comes out of the oven (10:20am)."
2,"This place is ok, as my rating says. I come here for the lemon horns. They run out relatively quickly so get here early. The pastry is flaky and the filling is just as a lemon filling should taste - sweet yet acidic. The cakes are ok but not too impressive. They had a recent renovation which seemed useless. I'm sure there are better in Chinatown. The only reason this one is frequented so often is because of its location next to the 99 Ranch Market."
2,"Came here to pick up a cake for a birthday. First thing i saw was the egg custard. After that I didnt care much for the cake. All i wanted was that egg custard. Anyways this place is good. Line wasnt bad when getting the cake. PIcked up the cake around noon. It wasnt busy at all. Wouldve liked it if i went in here when they have all the stuff just out of the oven! That would have been the best. I wouldve gotten 1 of each if i had enough money that time. There were a lot of stuff i wanted to get but i didnt have time. Like i said, only thing i wanted was that egg custard!! I dont think i got a taste of that cake during the birthday party"
1,"I come from socal and this place would never survive there.  Nonetheless, this is the only place that I could find decent sponge cake in vegas, and their pineapple custard buns are REALLY good.  The zong zi are bleh (filled with green bean, egg yolk and pork, but not much of any of those things) and not very fresh (we asked about the red bean zong zi and the lady that worked there actually told us not to buy it because it was really old).  The egg custard tars are also really tiny.  The steamed red bean buns are really really good though, and did I mention already that the pineapple custard buns are absolutely DELICIOUS?  \n\nAlso, be sure to come in here early to get the full selection - we went at around 3 in the afternoon twice, and all they had left was sponge cake and egg custard tarts."
0,"Warning!!! this place recycles rice and food. To my dismay, I observed the waiters pick out some rice parts from the rice bowls and then top it off. Later I saw one table had a leftover, they took it to the back, while they bussed the table and threw everything else away...hmm I wonder who they will serve that to!\nAvoid pork and clams, their meat is half rotted!!!\nRoast pork and duck taste ok.\nAlso they do not take credit cards. Just avoid this place."
0,"I wouldn't even give this place a star if it was possible. My family came here for dinner. We ordered deep fried tofu, half a duck, and salty fish fried rice. \n\nThe half duck didn't include any breast meat. It only included the worst parts of the duck. We complained to management, but they didn't seem to care and walked away. I'll upload an image of the bones. Duck breast meat bones are flat and long. \n\nThe fish fried rice did not actually include any fish. \n\nThe deep fried tofu was bland and uninteresting. \n\nIt was one of those, \""wow, these people really suck at their job\"" moments and one of the worst dining experiences of my life."
1,"Overpriced food here. The duck was OK, but i wish the skin should be crispy instead soft skin."
2,"We were in China Town Plaza wanting to grab a quick lunch but our little one wanted noodles. It was between this place and Harbor Palace.\n\nWe ordered the wonton noodles and dry beef chow fun.\nThe dishes were your typical decent Chinese food but I felt it wasn't worth the price we paid. Pretty much all the dishes here were overpriced and they didn't even have some sort of lunch menu/specials. \n\nI have to admit, the service was pretty decent but I think we'll stick to our usual Chinese restaurant, KJ Kitchen. \n\nP.S. Most of the restaurant near China Town areas are CASH ONLY. So, be sure to bring some cash..."
0,"Date/Time:  Saturday - 7:30pm\nOccasion:  Dinner with daddy and little brother\nParty of:  Three\nLocation:  Typical Chinese restaurant. Simple decor. Not the cleanest\nOrdered:  Westlake Beef Soup, Flamebroiled Pepper-Beef Steak, Ginger Chicken, and Seafood-Tofu claypot\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$\n\nExpensive.  Definitely gone down-hill.  And quite simply put, not worth it.  The only thing worth mentioning was the soup.  The pepper beef steak was sliced way too large and quite difficult to chew.  The ginger chicken was terribly dry.  And I wasn't interested in taking another bite of the seafood tofu claypot.\n\nTo top it off, each entree ran $12 - $18.  $60 for four entrees at a Chinese restaurant?? Definitely not worth it it!  I've typically gone here for lunch and ordered noodles.  Now I'm scared and likely not to return.  I'm going to stick with pho in Chinatown from now on.  Fellow yelpers: any suggestions on other better Chinese restaurants in the area? ;)"
2,"Food - 5 stars \nDelicious Chinese food. We ordered so much food for five people: \n- Seafood chow mein - Good flavor and lots of seafood.\n- Seafood soup - Very gingery if you don't like the flavor. \n- BBQ pork - From what I was told, most of the pieces were fatty. Dish was small for $10. \n- Tofu bowl with seafood, chicken, and veggies - Okay dish.\n- Mixed veggies with fungus and various mushroom - Yum! This was delicious. \n\nPrices were a bit higher than what we're used to back in the Bay Area. \n\nWatch your food. Our dishes has plastic and foil pieces. \n\nCleanliness - 1 stars\nCheck your utensils for leftover food. Tables were also not wiped down very well. Lastly, the floor had lots of napkins, chopsticks, and food. I can't believe this restaurant received an A grade! \n\nService - 2 stars \nEven from the beginning of the experience, service was not great. The person at the front pointed to our table and gave us our menus. We also had to ask our waiter for so many items - rice, clean utensils, and our bill. \n\nOverall, good food, but that is all."
1,I remember coming to this location with my family every time we were in Vegas. I wanted something cheap and delicious. I found the latter! \n\nOrdered the: \n* 1/2 Roasted Duck - It was actually quite good here but my boyfriend commented on the small portions compared to Cali Sam Woos. \n* BBQ Pork & Chicken Rice - Ahh tasted just like home\n* Veggies (suggested seasonal veggies) - simply saut\u00e9ed with some garlic & salt. Srzly can't go wrong. \n\nIt was quite expensive here though - bill came out to be around $50 or so. I mean sure we ate for 3 MORE meals but....\nAND it's cash only. \n\nI think I'm going to try Capital Seafood upstairs next time.
1,"Service and cleanliness and such were okay, but the food was mediocre compared to other places in town and it was expensive for the low quality and taste they offer. Their BBQ to go for the duck and pork are much better, but this isn't a good dine in place."
0,"This is one of the worse restaurants ever! I must admit their food is somewhat delcious but the service is a big FAT F! My freinds and I decided to dine in late one night. We ordered and as usual these waiters in chinese restaurants are rude which we just ignored. As our order was put in they waiter comes back with our BILL, he stated \"" the cashier is leaving and they were ready to close the register\"". We did not even receive our food and they were already throwing the bill at us. I thoguht that was flat our rude!! even thou the food was good we were not doing to deal with this we got up and left the table! I would not reccomend this place at all! they were closed before for a horrible food inspection grade of F. Your better off eating at panda express!"
0,I used to come here with the family every year whenever we were in Vegas. Saying that I went here a week ago and the quality has completely gone down the drain. I ordered the juk (rice porridge) with duck egg and pork. It was so watery and tasteless. Barely any pork or egg. Tasted like water. Then got the won ton soup with noodles. Again soup was just water. The won tons themselves tasted like they made them yesterday and just reheated them so they were chewy. I won't be coming back here. I guess I will have to find another chinese place if I'm craving good chinese food while I'm in Vegas.
0,"After 5 hours of nonstop driving from SD to Las Vegas, the fam decided to stop by the \""asian\"" area and get some food before we checked in at our hotel. Bad choice.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you are greeted with a wall of awards, recognitions, and accolades from websites and critics. I've been to a Sam Woo BBQ before, and this was uncommon. I thought it would lead to a good start, I was wrong.\n\nThose awards were issued in 2001, and boy, did they really change the restaurant till now. I ordered the roast pork and roast duck rice dish. Just to let you know, the prices for the food served here are double the price if the Sam Woo back in SD ($7-$10, Las Vegas Sam Woo $7-$20). Came pretty fast. The duck was OK, but the pork was really fatty. In fact, it was almost ALL fat. Not too good.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, ordered the Singapore noodles. While we were eating our food and finishing up, his food hasnt even left the kitchen yet. We asked if they forgot his order, and one of the waiters jus rudely replied:\n\n\""Its coming out, wait.\""\n\nAfter 10 minutes we asked again. Turned out they JUST started the order the second time we asked. The waiter didnt even acknowledge the chefs in the kitchen to see if they started. The food came, but the service spoke for itself already.\n\nNO GOOD."
0,"I've been to this Sam Woo several times in the past and it was alright, but when I went last week, it was NASTY.  The quality has definitely gone way down.  The crab soup was bland.  The beef chow fun was too salty from being drenched in soy sauce.  The fried rice and chow mein was okay but not that good.  We also had a mushroom claypot dish that was actually decent and it was the only dish that was hot.  We had a lot of leftover food and I was not full because I didn't like the food.\n\nThis place is dirty and the service is slow.  My teacup had a crack in it which made my tea leak.  Their highchairs were filthy.\n\nThis place is ridiculously overpriced.\n\nThis place doesn't deserve to be called Sam Woo because they make the chain look bad.\n\nOh, and it is cash only."
0,"Bad service and nothing special about it..\n\nCompared to other Sam Woo branch seriously, this branch doesn't really serve a good food.. \n\nNot a good value.. Don't waste your time and money here, especially if you're familiar with Sam Woo BBQ restaurants."
2,"This place keeps getting pricier every single time I came to Vegas.  Furthermore, I felt that this place has gone downhill.  The duck is not as good as it used to be.  But Sam Woo is still Sam Woo.  The food in general is not bad in my opinion.  Just reserve this place for the late night."
0,Very expensive tourist trap. The food is pure crap.
1,"For a change of scenery or you simply are sick of all-you-can-eat buffets, I would suggest this place. Just know that, like all other Asian restaurants, you are going to get terrible terrible service. The staff will act like they are doing you a favor by feeding you. The food at other Sam Woo's restaurants in Southern California is much better."
1,"This place could use more help and workers to really clean the place up and bus tables.  There was only one bus boy and two waiters for such a big place.  The food was barely ok, portion was small as well, not worth the price.  We will not come back there.  It is ridiculous for such a big name as Sam Woo restaurant chain."

0,"It is with great disappointment that I am writing to report my dissatisfaction with \""Soon\"", the proprietor of SPARKLE CLEANERS. For over 5 years, I have been taking the extra driving risk required to visit this location and take the quickest shortcut around the backstreets behind this block to head east on Sahara (otherwise one has to go over the 15 freeway before being able to U-turn from west to east.) This is NOT a convenient location from a driving risk standpoint.\n\nIt was on the advice of a friend when I first tried the cleaners and was well pleased when 75% of the time spots were successfully removed without a trace. This was magic and I kept coming back and referring  friends despite the additional cost. Okay, in 5 years I have only lost one item which may not be enough to be complaining about. But I think I need to tell the whole story so here goes:\n\nPatiently, I returned week after week to pick up my favorite white blouse (valued at $400 from Anne Fontaine at the Forum). She shook her head and said that it was not ready and that I should come back in another week. This went on for FOUR weeks. Finally, I received the blouse with her complaining about how much work it was to iron the sash. Well, that is what I thought I was paying for! Nothing but smiles from me; someone else had done the ironing while I did the driving and driving and driving...\n\nBiggest complaint:  when you drop off a valued item and expect that it will be rightfully returned, you do NOT want it to be implied that YOU are in error. This is the SECOND time that I met with great resistance when informing Soon of a mistake. The first time, it was with my other favorite white blouse valued at $200 from Saks. Soon tried to give me someone else's cheap white shirt instead. She insisted that it was mine. Politely, I pleaded with her that mine was different. She did not want to believe that it was a mistake, but I refused to take someone else's garment instead of my own. Weeks later, she called and apologized she had found mine. This was a relief. I honestly thought I had lost the garment. I continued to trust Soon.\n\nThis last and final time is the biggest disappointment because it resulted in the loss of a family heirloom. I took 12 blankets and quilts in for cleaning. I was very anxious over the fact that she was too busy to write a proper ticket for the items and instead she quickly took them from me and stuffed them all into plastic bags. I requested that she write a ticket, but she gestured for me to leave and that she had it under control. Against my better judgment, I allowed her too-busy demeaner to intimidate me. I left with a bad feeling. There was no indication of cleaning costs either. \n\nYou can guess what happened. I am given back only 11 of the items and charged a bill of $200 for cleaning these quilts, afghans, and wool blankets! Granted, this was an unusual cleaning order. I really should have been told what to expect. Worst yet, when I got home I realized that the most valuable wool heirloom blanket was MISSING. So I called immediately to let Soon know. She repeatedly insisted that I was mistaken (just as she did with the white blouse she later found) and that there were no other blankets in for cleaning but mine and that I had received them all. Now, I feel like a fool for continuing to allow myself to be treated this way. Even if there is a risk of property loss, I should not have to be treated without respect as a long-time loyal customer. Would you?"
0,"I came to this cleaners for a bridesmaid dress to be altered and I was extremely happy with it.  Since I live close by I figured I would try the Dry Cleaning side of.  I will NEVER EVER come back to this place again.  I feel like I was totally ripped off.  \n\nI dropped my clothes off on a Thursday and she said to pick them up on Tuesday.  (Open all weekend so why so long).  I came in today Tuesday at 4pm.  She told me they JUST STARTED working on my items and she would call me when they would be ready.  1 hour later she said they were ready.  I picked them up, took them home and this is when I get heated.  \n\nMy Herve Leger dress I dropped off was the only thing that looked cleaned.  I had black shoe polish stains on it from an event I had attended and lucky for me they came out and the dress looked brand new.  I made such a stink about this dress to the older Asian lady at the front of the store, she knew I was going to make sure this dress was spotless when I came back.  All my other shirts still had water stains on them and they looked dirty still.  It looked like all my other items were just pressed so they looked like they were treated.  I think they ran out of time and got lazy and so they cleaned the Herve Leger dress and just pressed the other items to save time and to rip me off! I called as soon as I got home and noticed all of this and the same lady played dumb with me.  She said I could come back the next day and they would fix it but as I told her before, I was going out of the country and needed these items.  She then said to bring them in when I get back and they will correct the issue but to be honest, after reading others reviews on this place, I do not trust Sparkle Cleaners.  I'll take a loss on this and go back to my other dry cleaners across town.   Save yourself the trouble people!!"
0,"If I could give this place and its employees zero stars I would have. \n\nI had pretty much the same experience as the other reviewers here. Unbelievably long waits (although the waiting room had a max of 8 people in it). Rude and dismissive nurses and employees, and I couldn't find a trash can or box of tissues to save my life! I was in Vegas on vacation with my father and had the unfortunate experience of getting a severe case of food poisoning. I was already scared since I was in a strange city and in a lot of pain. I know that waiting is to be expected in ERs but the kind of rude treatment that I received by a couple of the nurses was simply inexcusable (and I am a very patient and low-maintenance patient typically). There was one nurse named Lori that was an angel, and the student doctor that was there was not too bad either, but the majority of the staff were simply lounging around chatting and didn't want to be disturbed by a paying patient who was suffering and scared. All I can say is- pray that you never get sick in Vegas and if you do, go ANYWHERE but UMC."
0,"This is most undoubtably, the worst hospital in the Las Vegas valley. \nParking is always a nightmare, a vast majority of the staff is rude and show no care or compassion, Attending Physicians hardly communicate with each other or their Residents/RN's etc, parts of the hospital lack serious house-keeping, food in the cafeteria is never anything more than lukewarm, emergency room nurses are rude and condescending, it's far too easy to gain access to any part of the campus.\n\nMy list goes on for DAY'S! Do NOT go to UMC. There are 20+ other hospitals that I'd rather spend my $1000's of dollars at."
1,"Went here for pneumonia. Emergency room dirty and packed. Horrible reception staff. Nurses in ER especially Erin was awesome. Went into IMC/ICU for pneumonia and empyema. Docs inserted a chest tube. Which they did not drain enough and ended up hospitalized again 2 weeks later with a new chest tube at mike o Callaghan hospital (horrible ER awesome ICU care and specialized docs/pulmonoligist). UMC ICU had the worst CNA's (Sally was the worst no respect and careless) and nurses (1 good nurse Teresita she helped when she was assigned to me). They were rude. Esp the fact most were Filipino nurses. I am Filipino and my wife is white as snow. They did not treat her with any respect.  Careless and no care for the pain I was in.\nRude, dirty, bad care, bad doctors on decisions to discharge patients when not fully recovered. \nHopefully new president fixes the patient care here."
0,"Very unprofessional. They have unclear and unprofressional business policies. Did not accept company check from another tow yard, was not told this untill we made the 5 hour drive to pick up a vehicle. Office personell are very unhelpful. When our business owner called to talk to a supervisor they said it is business policy that no one can speak to a supervisor. Horrible business."
0,"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! \n\nI understand no one will be happy to get their car towed, but this place is a joke. \n\nI was also one of the victims at Firefly (separate night from the previous review..)  15 of us got towed at Firefly, when there was only 2 8.5x11 signs on a light pole outside of an abounded building, NOT near the parking.   I was parked in a spot labeled \""Visitor\"".  If this many cars are getting towed everyday, that says something about their communication about parking there. \n\nThis place only takes cash (so they can probably pay a chunk to whoever else is part of the parking scam at Firefly..) and they charge $7 ATM fee.  \n\nMy license was in my car, in my purse, and they wont let you go to the lot to get it, someone brings it out to you. \n\nThe manager at this place told me Firefly has been doing this for months.  And that Firefly wont pay to use those parking spots, so the owner of the empty building next door tows the cars every night. \n\nI finally get my car-- IT HAS A BLUE SCRATCH ON IT!!!  It is about one square foot that was NOT there the night before. They had me fill out a piece of paper and said the \""claim team\"" will contact me... . it does no seem promising..I am still waiting for that call. \n\nI mean what tow company will pass up the experience to tow cars, but this place is SHADY!!"
2,"I have been here two times. It's not a bad place. Atmosphere is very nice. Waitress was friendly. Food was not bad, pretty average. If I am in the mood for simple Korean food,  would come to this place."
1,"I dined here with a friend yesterday and the first thing that drew us in was the happy hour special. We were able to choose 2 different types of Korean BBQ, a soup, and a beer or soju for just about $26. This is a great deal when it comes to Korean BBQ. The portions were ideal for 2 people. Most of the waitresses were friendly and helpful; however, we had one girl as our main waitress and she was not attentive and awfully rude. She left the bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) on the stove too long and it almost burned, so I had to flip them over, cut the meat, and distribute myself. Anytime we asked her for something, she seemed angry and frustrated. We said \""thank you\"" for everything she brought over (with extreme delay I might add), and I never heard her once say \""you're welcome\"". She spoke fluent English, so I knew that wasn't the issue. Also, the food... I guess coming from the NYC area I am extremely biased; however, I was rather disappointed. The food wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near my expectations. The bulgogi was in large pieces and not juicy and the pork bulgogi was not spicy (pork bulgogi is supposed to be a spicy, flavorful dish). The side dishes were the most disappointing part. Usually, in Korean BBQ houses, you receive a bunch of side dishes to compliment your meal. Korean Garden BBQ House only gives about 4. So overall, I most likely will not be returning and if you've ever had great Korean BBQ, I do not recommend this place. My search for a 5-star Korean restaurant in Vegas continues.."
0,Had the Beef Bulgogi box and ordered sides of the kimchi.   WORSE BULGOGI I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Dry and no taste.  VERY VERY VERY Disappointed.  Will never eat here again
3,"We went here on a saturday night with a group of 5 people for the AYCE, and quite enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe food was great; I definitely prefer their sides to Tofu Huts, though I still like Honey  Pig's Kim chi and pickles better. I did miss beef tongue, which they do not seem to have. Sad face. \n\nIt may be due to where our table was; directly along the wait staff's path to the kitchen, or due to the fact that we ate pretty late at night and the restaurant wasn't packed, but we didn't seem to have the service problems a lot of other yelpers encountered. \n\nPros:\n- Great food, lots of different sides. My favorite bean paste stuff I've had in Vegas.\n- You'll have infinitely better luck getting in here than at Tofu Hut. Also, more parking.\n- Quite affordable for the amount and quality of meat. Much nicer meat cuts than tofu hut.\n- Incongruous and lovably campy tiki party atmosphere! Korean Dramas on TV!\n\nCons:\n- No beef tongue! \n- Service can be a bit on the slow side. Wasn't super bad, but we did have to ask and wait for water a few times. This seemed to stem from staff being busy, and they were super friendly."
3,"Great place to eat! Not only is the food great but the service is also great! I have a hard time finding great service in Asian restaurants. They came around regularly and we didn't feel like they were ignoring us. They also came around and helped with the BBQ from time to time. Their spicy squid and beef tofu soup were a little spicier than I would have liked them to be. I'm not a big fan of this mashed potato side dish they have. I'm definitely a big fan of beef tongue, squid, brisket, Kim chi, and bulgogi."
2,"Came here on a recommendation of a friend, and for a bachelor party, and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed! \n The gals are friendly and not pushy. Bottle service is a good way to go. \n And the funny thing was they weren't gonna let me in since I was wearing a wifebeater, but they let me buy one of their t-shirts($20) to put over it, and they let us all in for free!!!\n And all the gals are pretty attractive."
0,"Okay, so my husband wanted to go here since he'd heard of it. Big, big mistake. If could give them 0 stars I would. \n\nFirst, DO NOT take a taxi to get there. They charge you $30 per person if you do, because they have to pay off the taxi driver. So don't expect the $10 price advertised on their website. And don't forget the 2 drink minimum per person, and drinks are $15 each. \n\nSecond, it's not nearly as nice as I expected it to be. The reputation is as a high class strip club, but in reality it's very trashy. The girls were so-so, nothing special. None of them really made use of the poles. If you want a good pole dance show, try Cirque du Soleil instead. \n\nI highly, highly recommend against going there.  Definitely not the kind of place where a woman can go with her husband comfortably."
0,"Friendly bouncers (not a good thing).  Unattractive women.  STANK.\n\nWhatever you do, do NOT come to Cheetah's for a good time.  You're not gonna find it here.\n\nWe were dropped off by a shuttle on our second stop for the night.  I'm not sure exactly what time it was, maybe 3am on a Saturday night.  The first thing that I noticed when walking in was that the bouncers were COOL.  As in smiling and friendly.  That totally threw me off.  It couldn't have been a good sign.\n\nWe walked in (no cover, I would have been PISSED if we had to pay), and it STANK.  Like cigarettes and ass and no attempt at covering up with perfume.  They seriously need to have their ventilation system worked on if they even have one.  If there is any kind of CFM air change code requirements, this place isn't meeting them.  We sat down, and there were only maybe 5 girls working, and no one on stage.  Yes, I realize it was late.  But it was a SATURDAY NIGHT IN VEGAS!!  The girls were pretty nasty looking, and I was DRUNK!  Can't get much sadder than that.  We stayed maybe 10-15 minutes before I was able to get ahold of a cabbie I met to save us from this shithole.  \n\nI have heard of Cheetah's, but whatever magic there may have once been here has crawled into a corner and died with a lit cigarette in its mouth.  I will never be back for any reason.  Stay away!"
1,"Cool layout big bar! But the girls? Alot of them look like there on drugs. I say they ranged from zeros to a couple of 5s. Sad to say watching the customers was more amusing than watching the girls. Not only were they not cute, but their dancing was WACK. the dj played pretty good music tho. Drinks were weak. I left without a lap dance. Need I say more?"
4,Will always remain one of my 'to go' places when passing through vegas.
1,"I was very excited to check this place out, it had been written up as one of the classic/oldest steak houses in Vegas so my co-workers and I went in with great expectations. \nWhen we arrived the dinning room was almost completely empty, the hostess was very sweet and set us up in a nice booth. This is where things started falling apart, it comes down to just crappy service. The waiters, dressed in tuxes gathered in a group outside the kitchen and showed little to no interest in providing any level of service. When a waiter did show up to take my coworkers drink order my coworker  asked if they had any IPA's to which the waiter said  that they had Heineken my coworker pointed out that this was not an IPA which the waiter then disputed. I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself. I can't say enough about how bad the service was I'm pretty easy going but I was pissed my the time we were done eating. The food was good which is why I'm giving them 2 stars otherwise it would be one star. \nWhen we were leaving  we told the hostess of our dissatisfaction and she took down our emails and assured us that we'd be taken care of and would receive some sort of compensation, over a week later this hasn't happened."
2,"This is not the same restaurant of past years.  Been eating at the Golden Steer since the early 1970's and the service and food was outstanding.  Going down hill since the 2000's.  Will not eat there any more.  Not worth the value.  Staff was very friendly and they decor has not changed.  I ordered a NY Strip steak and they butterflied it and took all the flavor out it.  We used to brag about his place to all we know who were traveling to Las Vegas, no more."
3,"Definitely an old school steak house and I say that in a good way!  I haven't been here since the 80s when we came here as tourists.  \n\nA friend and I went here to enjoy a tasty steak, and that's just what we did.  Since we were there early, we had run of the place.  We took photos of the different booths where Sinatra, Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin dined.  The hostess showed us a side room where she said Tony Spilotro would dine and she had a story about a counter where their guns were placed before they sat down.  When she said that he was there only a month before his body was found in the desert (after he was murdered, he was buried in a field in Indiana), it cast a little doubt on the authenticity of her story.  Enough of that, on to the meal.\n\nWe both ordered the 12 ounce filet that their menu refers to as \""the Aristocrat of Tenderness).  I ordered a chopped green salad with Roquefort dressing.  I got the jumbo baked potato that the menu bills as \""Vegas' biggest.\""  Finally, we each had some chocolate cake for dessert.\n\nThe bread basket was simply some sliced Italian bread--nothing special.  The steaks were wonderful.  Mine was very tender.  I ordered it back and blue and that's almost the way I got it.  It was done a bit more than I prefer.  My friend ordered his well done--he's a Brit--go figure, but he enjoyed his steak, too!\n\nI only got butter with the baked potato and it was swimming in butter.  It was excellent!  My friend got fries which he described as chips as good as you can get in the States and as good as what he gets at home.\n\nWe both ordered the chocolate cake.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  It was a bit dry and a bit small.  There was no dollop of whipped cream to dress it up.  \n\nService was great.  Our server has been with the Golden Steer for years, and he was on top of everything.  Very nice dining experience in a classic Las Vegas steakhouse that has been around for years and years."
0,"From the moment I waked into this place I was made to feel like I did not belong. Even with a reservation, they made me feel as though I was not welcomed. Rude host staff and bartender who seemed to truly careless about anybody other than some fat cat sitting on the end of the bar. \n\nOh, well, on to my seat, and this is where the fun begins. I should have trusted my gut instinct immediately upon entering the restaurant and gone someplace else, btu I was hoping the food would redeem the poor service.\n\nI was sooo wrong. \n\nThe food here was not what I expected for the price. My steak was tough, filled with tendon and not cooked properly, Escargot was amazingly bland, and sides had a \""pre-packaged\"" taste/quality I could not get past. On top of the \""okay\"" food, the service was disgusting. I dined alone, and was not pinching pennies; I wanted to spoil myself. At the end of the meal my server asked me if I had a coupon! This was beyond outrageous and I can venture a guess at to why he targeted me as a possible \""coupon carrying\"" person. I paid cash, no coupon, and vowed to never return to this place that clearly is use to, and wants to, cater only to the \""Good Ol' Boys\"". They should really be ashamed."
1,"While the steak and table side Cesar Salad was perfection, NOTHING else at this restaurant was even close to acceptable.  From the moment we arrived, until we left, our service was simply HORRIBLE. First, at the hostess stand the hostess stood glaring at her computer screen as we stood waiting to be acknowledged. Never did acknowledge us, so we turned around and went to the bar. 2 cocktails (a beer and a wine) 17 bucks, gave the older man bartender a 20 and he NEVER CAME BACK WITH OUR CHANGE! The assumption that, that was his tip was rude and in very bad service and bad form. Of course he was going to get that as his tip, but to assume. BAD!  VERY BAD. Its stealing! And if he \""forgot\"" even worse, he shouldn't be working at such a restaurant as the Golden Steer.  So we went back to the stand and the \""harried\"" hostess was able to accommodate our reservation, clueless as to our earlier \""encounter\"".  The food service was slow, wreck-less (no refills of anything: water, bread, butter, coffee, or up-sell cocktails!), and the removal of dirty plates never happened. We stacked our plates to get them out of our way after sitting empty in front of us for 15 minutes. \nThe Prime aged 20 oz. T Bone was very good, as was the Cesar Salad. AS FOR the desert - forget it!! I wanted REAL NY cheesecake: I got Sara Lee...Im almost positive; NOT restaurant QUALITY in the least.  Coffee arrived bitter, luke warm, and no refills were offered. \nIn closing, Id skip Golden Steer. There are wayyyyy too many fine steak house in Vegas to be bothered with this dinosaur."
1,"Met friends from out of state that we wanted to please. Had eaten here before and were delighted. Can not say the same about tonight. Met at the bar brought to our table, forgot to give menus which was not so terrible. Took another 30 minutes if not more before a waiter decided to come over. My glass of water was not replenished once throughout the meal. The waiter put on his best de Niro game face and tried to make light of the situation. But when diners are spending the kind of money we spent or would have spent more the service should have been top notch instead we were treated like this was steak and ale. Will not be back."
2,"Jay, gave me the worst service, ever! He reached across a couple of our guests to serve drinks and when he finally got around to taking our dinner order, at his leisure. All of our drinks were empty, and that didn't seem to bother him either. And amidst him taking the time out of his busy schedule to take our order( with 3 other tables in the place), he proceeds to tap his hand on his crossed arms. One of our group mentioned that we must have pissed off the waiter.  Steaks, tough! Feel free to check out my other reviews. I am never negative about restaurants, but this one took the cake. The only reason it was given 3 stars was because of the atmosphere. So if tou dont care about the food being good, or the service being worth a darn, well this is your kind of place!!"
0,Don't know how this chain stays in business. The food they put out is under par and when you bring it to their attention its hilarious to see the look on their face. It just comes from poor or no management.  2 people here and half the table are dirty.
3,"The omelets are HUGE!! If I'd known this I probably would have gotten the \""baby\"" size which I'm sure is still gigantic.\nI had the popeye omelette which has spinach, mushrooms, jack cheese, and I added bacon. Then they give you the option of pumpkin bread or toast. I had the pumpkin bread which came out first, steaming hot with a side of butter. very good! Overall, this place is a fun breakfast spot to check out. Kinda hole-in-the-wall, country diner feel, but tasty! The only disappointment was weak coffee, and we'd been up since 6:30, so I needed it.\nI went with my boyfriend and his two little ones (2 and 4) and the service staff was very friendly to the kids and accommodating to their needs."
0,"After all the great reviews my husband and I decided to give it a go.... wah wah wah. Hubby ordered chicken fried steak and banana bread. He said the bread was awesome, and that the chicken fried steak was o.k and that Big Dogs is better. I ordered the American Cheeseburger ( i know i ordered a cheeseburger in a breakfast joint ) but I was still thinking its a family owned diner it should be good. BIG Mistake..it was hands down the worst cheeseburger I have had in my life! The meat tasted like it was old and from one of those tubes that you buy for 2 bucks at the store. It was burned on the outside and pink in the middle, over worked dry and tough, the bun was wet from the wilted veggies. It actually made me sick ( i only are 2 bites )The atmosphere is unclean and it smells like dirty grandmas. I dont know how it got so many rave reviews... I guess people have no taste buds! And to top it off it was 35 dollars ( with my daughters 1 pancake included ). Stay away unless you like being sick and paying for it."
2,"We went there for breakfast a Monday morning.  It was near noon, but they serve breakfast all day.  The place was pretty crowded and seems to be popular with older folks. It's very kitschy, but it has that old mom-and-pop diner atmosphere, and that type of menu as well.  We tried their stuffed French toast and their pancakes combos. The food was good, tasty enough, but not particularly outstanding or inspired.  Basically, this is your typical all-American breakfast joint.\n\nFull review at http://www.marga.org/foodblog/2011/08/omelet-house-las-vegas-review/"
0,"I have been to a lot of restaraunts and worked in the hospitality industry for over 18 years and I can clearly state \""THIS IS THE NASTIEST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.\""  Right from the get go, the smell here is horrific.  Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say \""Yeah, that's a lot of mustard\"".  That was his solution.  \n\nSo in a nutshell:\n1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\n2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.  \n3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.  \n\nThis place should honestly be blown up.  What a pit of despair."
3,"This is a great spot for breakfast off the strip.  It doesn't have much appeal, but it makes up for it with the food.  The Omelet House has the best banana nut bread hands down.  The omlets and other breakfast items are good, but you definitely need to eat here for the banana nut bread."
0,The whole place smells like dirty grease.
4,"Big portions, tasty and some of the best service we have received! This will be my Vegas go-to breakfast place."
1,Food OK service needs improvement my server took my order wrong and did not check until the end
2,"The waitress was quite nice. The potato chips are awesome. The rest of our food was just ok, nothing spectacular. Place is very old school. It was an ok breakfast in general here ..."
3,Amazing warm banana nut bread and delicious potatoes! The omelettes are huge...consider sharing. Coffee is not the best but everything else makes up for it. Friendly service and cozy place....the restaurant is inside a shopping center not to be confused by the sign.
1,"I did not have the same experience as many of these other reviewers which is surprising.  I met a colleague here for breakfast during the week and we were greeted promptly - service was fine.  I ordered the Petunia Pig omelet and my colleague ordered the Corn Beef Hash.  The food portions were big, but the taste was lacking.  My eggs were a bit overcooked and did not have enough cheese or meat in the omelet.  The \""homemade potato chips\"" which accompanied the dish were nothing special - would have preferred hash browns.  The toast was dry.  I just wasn't impressed.  I've had many other breakfasts here in Vegas including the other Omelet House in Henderson (which was great).  Not sure what went wrong today."
4,Banana bread is the greatest on earth! It's worth driving here just for that alone. The breakfast is huge and the price is tiny! My new favorite place!
1,"*** Kosher  Chabad of Southern Nevada ***\n\nI am in Las Vegas from time to time and I have been going to this restaurant for years spanning several owners.  My last trip, I stopped in expecting the usual avergae - good pizza \""joint\"" fare -didn't happen.  \n\nAlthough the proprietress was... homey and friendly, she was more interested in talking on the phone than waiting on me even though I said I was in a rush.  The place was empty and tables dirty and piled with dishes from lunch rush I guess.  The Air conditioning was NOT ON (Vegas can be quite hot) and in general the place was not impressive.  I asked for slices (in a hurry) no slices, I asked what was fast \""everything takes the same time\"" so I ordered a fallafel figuring how long could that take...  I watched as the guy in the kitchen made the Israeli salad veg by veg thinking that couldn't possibly be for me... after all I was in a hurry -yeah right.  I had to eat quick (and in the car) on my way to my next customer so I asked for no techina sauce -again, yeah right.  So hurrying to my customer eating at red lights the thing became a soggy mess.\n\nIt was WAY overpriced (IMHO) and the place is NOT suitable for a business lunch.\n\nAlso, the coup de grace, was ill the rest of the day -yes from the food but decorum prohibits me from relating the details here...\n\nI will not be going back...."
0,"This place don't need a makeover, it needs a bulldozer.\nIt puts the whole community to shame."
0,"Just called to see if I could get someone to take a look at our gate. The young girl answering the phone, without even asking my name or what was wrong with the gate told it me would cost $225... Asked her if maybe they might want to take look at the gate first, see how big it was etc. maybe let me get out two words explaining the issue but she said that's just what it costs for a repair period and was done with the very rushed curt conversation. Might want to work on that customer service Artistic."
3,"Items selected:  Bavarian, Blueberry Cake, Blueberry Fritter, Sourcream, Buttermilk Bar, Raised Glazed, Reverse Cinnamon Roll, Chocolate Cake, Crumb Cake, Apple Fritter\n\nHaving arranged various \""foodcrawls\"" in the past it was with admitted enthusiasm that I entered Real Donuts to gather provisions for Las Vegas' first (known) donut crawl and with several glistening varieties fresh from the fryer only two challenges arose, the first limiting my order to a dozen and the second delivering the fried dough to the party without sneaking a bite.  A small, clean shop with excellent service and a dozen donuts only $10 after tax and a tip it was up against three other doughnutteries that Real would find itself matched and although the occasional contender from Sunrise Too, Master Donuts, or Donut Hut shined it was Real Donuts that proved most consistent across the board.  Featuring crispy fritters rife with fruit and low in oil, a textbook old-fashioned sourcream that literally melts on the tongue, and both yeasted and cake options on par with the city's best it would truly be hard to name a bad one in the bunch - a task I'll simply discard and suggest futile as I think back on the Blueberry Fritter, a 95 cent daily special I'd suggest worthy of 'destination' status."
2,"My first time there and the young I would say pacific island young lady was  semi friendly it was early right at opening I got there. However She began to warm up as we were choosing the doughnuts we wanted. 2nd time I went was last week , week and few days, and a lady I would say in her mid 30 to early 40 maybe assisted me. I walked in yet again right close to opening, as I walked in I noticed PRE-PAK BOX of doughnuts to my curiosity I asked, oh what are those , I will take one of those since they are ready to go. she then said OH those are on reserve , I said oh, well why don't you have a sign on them, she said they are DAY OLD they sell from the previous night for 5.00 a box of 21 doughnuts and ALL boxes are Reserved. Well here I am at 415-425 am first customer probably in the door, and here comes another customer, a Male who grabs a box of those SAME doughnuts and proceeds to the counter to PAY. As I am finishing my selection of buying my 9.00 dozen, it ERKED me to know she has not said a word to him about these RESERVED Doughnuts. So I did \n\nThen she went in hyper voice aka Busted voice, and told him They are on reserve , and I told HER, Then you shouldn't have out for ,customer perception of thinking they can grab and go, or you need to label them as reserved or you need to keep them in the back as reserved items Should be located . Needless to say she Heard NONE of my suggestions just kept RUNNING her MOUTH of Guiltless that Customer Was like Oh these are the day old Doughnuts for $5 a box, I said Oh I know I just learned that just NOW. However she told me they are on RESERVE, she then turned to him and said Yes they are, That customer, got angry and walked out without further word \n\nI paid my $9.00 only because they were already selected and in a box, but I surely FELT very cheated and very robed. As it should NOT be a RESERVED STATUS ON DAY OLD DOUGHNUTS. But rather a First Come First Serve Basis Period. \n\nNeedless to say. 2nd time was not an invite to Return BACK . \n\nDoughnuts were a bit sweet, however the cake one with cream in the middle was beginning to be one of my likes, as it was one that was in the middle of the road."
3,"Doughnuts. Donuts. Dog Nuts...whatever you call them for the most part, they're all tasty. Well maybe not dog nuts. \n\nLets get real, this place is like a fried dough time machine and I love it. Real Donuts definitely keeps it real; from the wood paneling on the walls to the $1 doughnut, it's like walking into the \""Wonder Years\"" TV show. \n\nI originally came here for the inverted cinnamon rolls, but found myself buying up pretty much everything in the display case. The maple & peanut covered cinnamon rolls, cherry frosted french crullers, bear claws, the classic Simpsons doughnut (pink frosting & sprinkles), maple bars, and nearly everything in-between. \n\nNot to forgot my savory side, I also bought a jalape\u00f1o croissant stuffed with turkey, swiss cheese, and chunks of my favorite spicy pepper. This was delicious; the bread was super soft and I was told it was made fresh that morning. Sure tasted like it! This treat is a must if your taste buds like to live on the spicy side. \n\nBefore I left I asked about the two giant doughnuts that looked like they were drawn on a board behind the cash register. One is called \""The Texas\"" which is a giant glazed doughnut, about 8 inches in diameter?. The other doughnut is called \""The Alaskan\"", this is what looks like a 16 inch fried piece of heaven?. I'm not sure, but sadly it didn't matter, \""The Texas\"" was sold out and \""the Alaskan\"" is made-to-order. Next time, my doughnut loving friends!"
4,"If your looking for a good buzz and a nice shave this is the place to hit up!\nGerardo's is one place i would return to every two days just cuz im pretty hairy. lol On a Fa real tip though im from Cali and when i stepped into this place I thought I was in cuba, It has a very nice ambiance and the staff makes you feel very welcome. This is one of the first barber shops I have ever been to and I have to tell you it is exactly what i expected. Nothing short of fanaminal. On another note I was refered to this place from another barber shop called FINO, a \""Gentlemens Barbershop\"" . Im Glad i ended up going to Gerardo's. It is ThE' BEST place."
0,"By far the worst bank I've ever banked with. How the HELL do you charge your own clients money to withdraw from your own atm??? Um...... they do!!!! It's normal for another atm to charge you a fee...... Well so does this bank. You not only get charged with the other bank or atm fee, but 1NCU also charges you a $3 fee for using another bank or atm. Really???? I can't stand the service. There bank has 2 tellers only, and the line could be full as 15-20 people and there isn't any additional help provided. The list goes on and on. I'm exhausted just thinking about the problems............. oh yeah, they also charge you $19.50 a month just to have a checking account. HaHahaha. I love this free world............ Not!!!!!! One Nevada Credit Union is garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bank of America or Wells Fargo here I come."
1,"Disclaimer: I absolutely love One Nevada. My review for this location is solely based on this location and not the services of One Nevada overall.\n\nThere just must be something about when you put a teller behind a bullet proof glass case but attitudes here are no where near as friendly or personable at other branches that I am accustomed to visiting.\n\nI wouldn't even visit this location if I didn't have to but since this is the only location with a transaction center, I am forced to. The tellers do their job but basically that is it. Do not expect a \""thank you\"" or \""you're welcome\"". Definitely do not expect a \""have a nice day\"" or \""thank you for business\"". \n\nI hope One Nevada catches on and does some employee intervention with this branch. Coming is here is extremely unpleasant and every time I leave this branch, I always think I need to change banks."
